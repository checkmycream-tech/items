            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for scalp psoriasis.</li>

            <li>Nothing works as good as this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this formula since it came out.</li>

            <li>The price is good and I like the results</li>
            <li>This head and shoulders is a fraction of the price and works just as good imo.</li>
            <li>Good for dandruff.</li>
            <li>it works really good but lose hairs that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>Head and shoulders is a really good brand when talking about hair products, and this is not the exception</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is good for the scalp, too.  </li>
            <li>it work&#x27;s good on my hair.</li>
            <li>Good but smell like medicine.</li>
            <li>I liked the price on this product and it work great if you allow it to soak into your scalp for 20 minutes before your shower.</li>

            <li>It is great to be able to buy from Amazon and show up at my door step,</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a  scent to it which is to cover up the not so great smell I am sure it has from the chems used to stop the skin problems..</li>
            <li>Very pleased and will buy again</li>

            <li>is an amazing very good shampoo leaves very clean and healthy scalp</li>
            <li>Its a great product that truely helps!</li>
            <li>More pleasant flavour -</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>The fact I could add this to my subscribe and save was amazing.</li>
            <li>Whatever the case, this 1% selenium sulfide concoction is amazing.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, and takes the itch away, but I am still flaking, even after over a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it on my own.</li>
            <li>This product is extremely effective.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and feel, and for the price for 2 bottles, you cant beat.</li>
            <li>While its provided some relief, its not as effective as I&#x27;d have imagined or liked it to be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you have any kind of chemical sensitivities I do not recommend buying.</li>
            <li>It is a nice smell and if it works that is all I care about.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>14.2 Fl Oz is an excellent product and really gets my hair CLEAN.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Always liked</li>
            <li>It lathers up nice and cleans your hair well</li>
            <li>And you can use a nicer smelling shampoo on the days you don&#x27;t decide to use this kind.</li>
            <li>but it was a nice gesture.</li>
            <li>This is honestly a life saver.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my VERY oily hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, highly recommended to control Seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and a great conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Very good, I&#x27;ve tried many brands and varieties for years and for the first time I&#x27;ve found a product that works!</li>
            <li>I has a very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>and it is very, very strong.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a disagreeable scent and the smell isn&#x27;t very strong either.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great, so I use a good smelling conditioner after, but it&#x27;s very effective all winter long.</li>
            <li>I suffer from Sebhorrheic Dermatitis of the scalp, and by far this is the best OTC product I have found.</li>
            <li>I found it works best in keeping my scalp in check as well as keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found so far in this category.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see the top of my own head,,</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t be able to smell my own hair once my shower is done.</li>
            <li>It really helps!!!very good!</li>
            <li>This really calms my scalp and cleans and smells really good too!</li>
            <li>Price was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be taken in by this too good to be true offer.  </li>
            <li>I will say it has that distinctive Head &amp; Shoulders scent, not really bad or good, but you&#x27;re not going to smell like lilacs unless you use scented conditioner or something.</li>
            <li>All in all I&#x27;d gladly deal with the smell, which can be mask with a little oil and good rinsing, for the awesome results.</li>
            <li>A huge difference!</li>
            <li>I would say it takes time to work, but after using 1 bottle, I am practically flake free!  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I see it works better than to just rinse it off immediately.</li>
            <li>I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every prescription shampoo and medicine on the free market!</li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for many years now.  </li>
            <li>If I use it once every three days or so, I never have any more issues.  </li>
            <li>I also love Nizoral</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, I had a fungal infections on my head and tried evrything and</li>
            <li>, as many know, Nizoral is now no longer OTC.</li>
            <li>Someone on here already said it&#x27;s considered prescription strength, and I can&#x27;t afford too many prescriptions.</li>
            <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 6 months now and my scalp is still blemish free!</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;d probably be better off trying something else.</li>
            <li>I tried many products including many from Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>i used many shampoos.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much more at this price.</li>
            <li>You understand the struggle that many of us have.</li>
            <li>used the shampoo again and felt better.  </li>
            <li>were GONE from the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will recommend it to anyone I know with dandruff.</li>
            <li>I prefer the selenium sulfide ingredient, but others think pyrithione zinc works better for them.</li>
            <li>The hair looked more healthy with the TGel to after hair dryed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with dandruff on and off most of my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I noticed and kept scrubbing my hair with the towel before I ruined my $200</li>
            <li>Works better than any dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s quite an array of interesting reviews for this shampoo.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s quite an array of interesting reviews for this shampoo.</li>
            <li>the two together help control my scalp problem better than anything I have tried before</li>
            <li>so good.the directions says use twice a week or more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews about it changing hair color make sure you thoroughly rise your hair out afterwards.</li>
            <li>It is certainly much better than the tar-based products.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>the price for this item is better for me to buy every 2 mouth.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>have seen many reviews on here that people complain of the smell.</li>
            <li>After a decade of itching, scratching, and embarrassment, I&#x27;m dandruff free!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>The smell could be better, but your will eventually get used to it.</li>
            <li>This is the one works well,  much better than those with Zinc</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful and actually does what it says.</li>
            <li>Selenium Sulfide does a much better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does a great job.  </li>
            <li>and i have like 6 moths without dandruff for the first time!!!</li>
            <li>I have had more consistent good results with this one</li>
            <li>One product (T-Gel ) that is supposed to help with Seborrheic Dermatitis makes your head smell like charcoal, not this product, it leaves my husband and sons hair smelling awesome, did i mention it made their hair super soft too?</li>
            <li>This shampoo smell very clean.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not completely cured, but it&#x27;s still the best thing I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>First, the good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not leave your hair dry and frizzy but excellent for dandruff.</li>
            <li>shampoo is fairly drying, but I rinse it well, use a good conditioner, and only wash every 5 or 6 days.</li>
            <li>While this shampoo also does not have normal shampoo smell, it&#x27;s smell is much more pleasant than Selsun&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad this product is available online</li>
            <li>Like magic, after about 2 months I was dandruff free.</li>
            <li>Itchyness goes away right away and rinses out nicely with no residue and lasts</li>
            <li>If I used Head &amp; Shoulders other versions, I will continue to have dandruff, but this version is the best.</li>
            <li>Best of Head and Shoulders products if you have oily dandruff prone scalp or active dandruff/seborrhea.</li>
            <li>Rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t smell offensive.</li>
            <li>The stench is strong.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, the couple of reviewers that believe it damaged their hair are isolated cases, but it is always a possibility with strong shampoos.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s THAT strong.  </li>
            <li>the product may be too strong for your hair.</li>
            <li>It has a light metallic tan colour and a strong medicinal-metallic smell.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that I came in here and wrote a quick review for this product before I forgot again.</li>
            <li>It smells very good, and it is not as strong as Nizoral or any other products used to control dandruff or SD.</li>
            <li>This is a small price to pay for the wonderful way this shampoo keeps my hair clean!</li>
            <li>-- do yourself a huge favor and remove them before you get into the shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That wouldn&#x27;t normally be a huge drawback, but the problem is that the scent will stay on your body for hours or even DAYS...</li>
            <li>Also, I wonder if you were to condition your hair with something lightly scented, whether that might mask the smell?  </li>
            <li>only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t smell too great.</li>
            <li>However, the smell doesn&#x27;t really give me a problem because the conditioner afterwards makes my hair smell nice</li>
            <li>I am so happy i finally found something that works.  </li>
            <li>love the tingle and fresh feeling on my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it</li>
            <li>I used tar shampoos for years with some success but this works better.</li>
            <li>Hubby loves this product for his itchy scalp and swears by it, all the sulphate free shampoo&#x27;s don&#x27;t work on his hair...</li>
            <li>Great now my RL towel is COVERED in yellow stains from drying my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to rinse well when using any dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a frequent sufferer of tinea and also have fairly oily skin/hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo - it really works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and really like it.</li>
            <li>Very impressed and such a pleasure to find something that really works</li>
            <li>Not as strong as imagined but not bad either.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it and found that it&#x27;s the best smelling Dandruff Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, and left my long hair nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>The flakes diminished significantly in size as well as in occurrence.</li>
            <li>dandruff that was so persistent for so many years disappeared literally overnight after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this brand so much!</li>
            <li>For the price, it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>The product is good for special hair care, but I would not suggest to use the product daily since its strong effect.</li>
            <li>It makes the itchies go away and keeps me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember where I had seen it but in a comparison test it seemed more effective than Selsun Blue.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair clean without stripping the oils.</li>
            <li>I used the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method for well over two years to clean my hair.</li>
            <li>I dont think it is more effective than regular head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>I leaves my hair feeling clean and gets all the product out.</li>
            <li>It smells like regular OTC Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo, which is to say, pleasant but not overly sweet or herbal.  </li>
            <li>He enjoyed a certain brand that has now been discontinued so we now use this</li>
            <li>it worked!&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff wasn&#x27;t all that was at stake though, as my hair was naturally very soft, strong, and healthy.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a Hard &amp; Shoulder Shampoo this is the best deal.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything special just smells ok.</li>
            <li>I found the clinical strength works a lot better for me, and is as gentle as it says it is.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair super clean and sometimes if I feel tinea coming on I will use it as a body wash</li>
            <li>those looking for a good dandruff treatment that is relatively inexpensive, I recommend this.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price out there, and when the product that &amp;#34;Ships &amp; Sold by Amazon&amp;#34; went out of stock, the product was only available from third party sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li>fast forward today, i tried this variant of H&amp;S and now i&#x27;m dandruff free again!</li>
            <li>I only have to use it once or twice a week to keep everything good.  </li>
            <li>It makes his hair soft and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe people that tell you this stuff reeks or stains towels, clothing, sheets; none of this is true.  </li>
            <li>A great product to try if you do not have other options.</li>
            <li>other than that works great.</li>
            <li>Love the rich texture - leaves hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>It had this peculiar odor that smelled like something that should give you super powers.</li>
            <li>was having dandruff and mild acne issues on neck...cleared both up .</li>
            <li>shampoo has a smell that I personally do not find very appealing.  </li>
            <li>The smell is classic Head &amp; Shoulders - very clean, but not medicinal.</li>
            <li>It soaps better and leaves my hair less fly away than the normal Head and Shoulders shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfy with this product and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>When I went back, I reported the good news, and he told me to taper off the prescription (which was very strong) onto this specific shampoo.</li>
            <li>But, the second day I seemed to have some kind of irritation from it that gave me mild hives.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, good packaging, got what I expected.</li>
            <li>This shampoo might work for other people with great results, but unfortunately not for me.</li>
            <li>If they would take out the scent I think it would be fine, the regular head and shoulders smelled ok and didn&#x27;t knock you over with the scent.</li>
            <li>Very well packed and delivered on time for free.</li>
            <li>The type of dandruff i have is not the flaking kind, it is more like an accumulation of dead cells stuck to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried any H&amp;S product in my life before a few weeks ago, but I bravely purchased this bottle in the hopes it would cure me.  </li>
            <li>but IT WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>Even though my experience is rare, it&#x27;s not something you want to pay money to experience.</li>
            <li>I put a fresh towel on my pillow each night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either way, this stuff is worth its weight in gold.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report that with this product I noticed an almost immediate difference, and somewhere between the first full week and second week of me using it, it completely cleared up my dandruff.</li>
            <li>I remembered using it and figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>worth trying this version of H&amp;S to see if it helps you.</li>
            <li>It is worth mentioning that I do use this product along with Neutrogena&#x27;s T Sal for scalp build up.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing for my super dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for two months and have not lost any hair or incurred temporary baldness due to this product, nor has it otherwise ruined my life or pursuit of happiness.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for two months and have not lost any hair or incurred temporary baldness due to this product, nor has it otherwise ruined my life or pursuit of happiness.  </li>
            <li>The smell, as noted by other reviewers, is overpowering and I&#x27;d advice to give your hair a really good rinsing after you shampoo it to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li>even the Dr. didn&#x27;t give the right medicine.</li>
            <li>This shampoo will take the color right out.</li>
            <li>I could tell it was working on her almost right away.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a sulphery after smell that haunts me off and on during the day and makes me feel like I have B.O especially when first stepping out into the sun.  </li>
            <li>It cost more (would LOVE to see the price come down)</li>
            <li>I was bummed actually, because I have been using Nizorail for some time which has been ok, but it no longer works the way it used to, and this was a far better deal as a 2 pack.</li>
            <li>Usually buy these in store, but there was a great deal on here with a $3 off coupon.  </li>
            <li>Normal Head and Shoulders smells really clean and fresh in the shower and then, once out of the shower, you don&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
            <li>It was also something I could use much more often than Nizorail (which recommended not using it for more than a few weeks at a</li>
            <li>i really like this shampoo very much!</li>
            <li>For all the hundreds I&#x27;ve spent, it&#x27;s an amazing relief to have this stuff work so damn well.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped my husband&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li>I like darker shades, so it was even more obvious.</li>
            <li>My oncologist recommended this shampoo and after the first time I used it, I felt the difference.  </li>
            <li>I bought it and the first time I used it it did get rid of my dandruff</li>
            <li>But like me, if you have SD, you&#x27;re willing to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried it tonight for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The olfactory assault is a bit overwhelming -- especially in the morning.</li>
            <li>update this review in a couple of months with further results.&lt;br /&gt;Found more than one article on the Internet suggesting the use of Baking Soda as a shampoo since it is supposed to remove accumulated gels, sprays, etc</li>
            <li>I have two bottles of this and probably won&#x27;t even use the second one, going to give it a couple more weeks</li>
            <li>Results can be seen the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>That my first product I tried  and</li>
            <li>According to my dermatologist, the way to keep seb derm under control is to rotate, so use this and others throughout the week to \\&quot;confuse\\&quot; your scalp into behaving, while not allowing it to adapt to one consistent method of treatment.  </li>
            <li>I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice &#x3D;].&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice &#x3D;].&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>If bread and butter Head &amp; Shoulders doesn&#x27;t quite do the trick for you, you might want to try this, but it doesn&#x27;t work significantly better to justify its potential drawbacks in my experience.</li>
            <li>(the first week)&amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly expensive and anyone commenting on the smell is just being a jerk.</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength is the only shampoo that was able to keep my hair from getting oily.</li>
            <li>Seborrheic dermatitis can result from one or more of several factors.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure will continue to keep it away for the foreseeable future.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Head &amp; Shoulders!</li>
            <li>In fact, noticed difference after first use.</li>
            <li>Noticed difference after first use</li>
            <li>husband and son have been using it for about 2 weeks now and it seems to really be helping!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough about how pleased I am with it.</li>
            <li>Been trying many brands, only this one works!</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and light.</li>
            <li>The odor itself might be pleasant enough if it simply weren&#x27;t so STRONG.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved how natural it was, and how it helped my hair with not needing a wash every single day.</li>
            <li>The bottles came fast and ironically right before I was going to take a shower after a workout.  </li>
            <li>It has a very clean smell to it, I get complements on its smell constantly.</li>
            <li>The active ingredient in this product, selenium sulfide, is effective at killing off the fungi.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will clear completely up in another week or so</li>
            <li>new and great no more flakes</li>
            <li>Nothing worked and I was positive</li>
            <li>This shampoo left my hair more flake and itch free than regular Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>For the whole three weeks, it was pretty effective at keeping dandruff levels down, by the day after I had showered, medium-sized flakes about the size of a rice grain would begin to reappear.</li>
            <li>My scalp still has flakes, but now they are normal sized ones that are present on every healthy scalp (skin sheds, remember) that aren&#x27;t unsightly and that get on everything.</li>
            <li>Dandruff and dry scalp was a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Works on most dry patchy skin problems.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the smell of the Nutragena T-gel extra strengh with the coal tar even though that is strong to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, even on the first wash, I experienced heavy hairfall, but not enough to make me overly nervous.</li>
            <li>It smells nice at first and then about a second later you get the chemical burn in your nose and throat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling severe dandruff for a few months now and after 2 weeks of using this product I&#x27;m 99% dandruff free!!</li>
            <li>If Selsun blue smell is too strong for you, try this; it works very well.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was very subtle however it gets more and more noticeable as you use it.</li>
            <li>Good Dandruff Shampoo and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this shampoo, I no longer host a ski resort on my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We really like the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very smelly.</li>
            <li>Product leaves a sticky residue on my scalp and hands; on anything it touches really.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This could very well cause a divorce in our house.  </li>
            <li>For years I had problems with a really itchy scalp and plucking off skin that was the size on an eraser head, after using this product it has no happened again.</li>
            <li>None could control the itch in any reasonable degree.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>People regularly compliment me on the scent of my hair, and I&#x27;m dandruff free.</li>
            <li>It really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I contacted the manufacturer about this bizarre issue but their only suggestion was to remove my jewelry before using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders uses way too much perfume in this product.  </li>
            <li>Still this is so much cheaper</li>
            <li>I was getting ready to go to a doctor and maybe try some sort of prescription when I found this.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>Honestly, an absolute nightmare.</li>
            <li>H&amp;S Clinical Strength really helped me, and I give it my wholehearted recommendation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>And, to his credit, I&#x27;ve remained dandruff free for almost 2 years on the combination of Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength for my daily wash, and the prescription once or twice a month.</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>My scalp started to become very itchy and dandruffy</li>
            <li>hair is cleaned very well.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really works to get that dandruff out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty</li>
            <li>I am free at last!</li>
            <li>I really like this for dandruff.  </li>
            <li>She smelled like a dude for a day, but this really took care of the cradle cap.  </li>
            <li>It really does what it says.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overal, highly reccomend!</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed in this product as I expected more from this brand.  </li>
            <li>Simply put, this shampoo is hands down the best thing I have tried to get rid of my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I refuse to use any other shampoo but head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does a better job on dandruff than any other over-the-counter shampoo.</li>
            <li>Compared to other products, I fell highly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>If you have extremely oily hair, I do not know of a better product that this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheaper than many of the other dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li>so I use this 2 times a week to deep clean and sooth my scalp.</li>
            <li>AMAZING,,, no more gunk in the ears.. cracking on face cleared up by the nose.  </li>
            <li>But after the first wash, it was about 50% clear.</li>
            <li>The first use almost completely cleared up the dermatitis and got rid of all the dandruff.</li>
            <li>The version offered on Amazon&#x27;s site is 1% Ketoconazole, prescription is 2%, (about $29) really not sure if that would make a substantial difference in how effective it is but decided to try the Head and Shoulders Clinical instead.</li>
            <li>At first I though I was being self conscious.</li>
            <li>The best part is, it doesn&#x27;t smell atrocious like most of the other anti-dandruff shampoos do, it is more or less odorless.</li>
            <li>OK (neither particularly bad or good), but</li>
            <li>My family also commented that my hair looked thinner and certainly less healthy.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t quick enough for me</li>
            <li>Smells strong of chemicals and not much improvement for my scalp.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s why attribute 80&amp; of my current scalp situation to this H&amp;S product and I super highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I normally use another cheap shampoo to get the hair wet and ready for this to soak in.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo to those who are looking for relief for stubborn dandruff.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>High recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and b) I read that it can cause hair loss in high doses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone suffering from dandruff.</li>
            <li>I always used the Clinical Strength Head and Shoulders when I was in high school</li>
            <li>I have been reading something about rotating dandruff shampoos that use different active ingredients to help control a powerful scalp problem, so I may include either a different brand or a different line within the same brand to ensure I remain flake free for good.</li>
            <li>It solves my sensitive hair better than other products.</li>
            <li>I did, however, decided to change my conditioner to something a bit more hydrating and strengthening  because I started to feel my hair go a little bit dryer.</li>
            <li>I have tried EVERYTHING at the drugstore (including every single H&amp;S product) to solve my dandruff/scalp build up problems and it isn&#x27;t until I&#x27;ve found this product that I have seen a significant result.</li>
            <li>shampoo is generally effective at controlling (or at least reducing the severity of) severe seborrheic dermatitis (seb derm).  </li>
            <li>The smell is really powerful, especially in summer, and has a sulfuric odor to it.</li>
            <li>The symptoms have not gone away, but it&#x27;s definitely more effective than all the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried (Head and Shoulders Dry Scalp Care Shampoo; Nizoral (ketoconazole); Dead Sea sea salt; Triamcinolone Acetonide;</li>
            <li>I imagine after a little more time, those areas will clear up too.</li>
            <li>your head smells after using this product you might need a new head.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried hot oil treatments, various pomades to try and seal in moisture, which helped some, but my scalp was still horrendously itchy.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I noticed a BIG difference after the first shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have scalp issues and this is the only shampoo that will work for me consistently.  </li>
            <li>My only advice is to try the cheaper shampoo first before moving up to ones that cost 15 or 30 dollars a bottle.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would leave a review for dandruff shampoo, or any other shampoo for that matter, but this is worth it!  </li>
            <li>I decided to finally try this one, not thinking it would do any better than all the other brands I&#x27;ve used for 35 years.  </li>
            <li>Controls my dandruff quite well, and smells better than the other blue brand you might know.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo, I noticed a big reduction in itching and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>more flakes, no more itching,</li>
            <li>After one use, the dandruff reduced almost completely!</li>
            <li>The only shampoo that consistently meets my needs.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this shampoo because my hair did not feel clean after using other products.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, instead of smelling like something pleasant, it has an \\&quot;I-use-budget-shampoo\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>just recently decided to try the Clinical Strength Head &amp; Shoulders, and as I said I&#x27;ve tried the less potent stuff before to no avail.</li>
            <li>I use this every time I wash my hair (pretty much every other day)</li>
            <li>Selsun Blue has a different active ingredient which may be better in your particular situation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing the hairfall was due to the selenium sulfide (selenium can cause hairloss in high doses) and the many sorts of sulphur-based detergents (which can be extremely drying, causing hair to snap near the root).</li>
            <li>I would try one bottle at least to make sure you have time to let it adjust and settle in.</li>
            <li>I became natural in 2009, but after I had my baby in 2010</li>
            <li>Not to mention I was trying to stay with consuming natural products, but they did not work and believe it or not tea tree did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>Since going natural, I&#x27;ve tried to stay away from laureth sulfate products, but if this product is stopping the itchiness and scaling, I guess me and laureth sulfates are friends and my natural hair doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with it.  </li>
            <li>I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter Khoret Amen Hair Smoothie for my deep conditioner (don&#x27;t care too much for the smell though, but it works).</li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis when I was a young teenager.</li>
            <li>Wow one time use and it was gone.</li>
            <li>It works well and your hair feels soft after use.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working as advertized.</li>
            <li>Just use it daily for awhile till you don&#x27;t think you need it as much</li>
            <li>looking for the old formula...works as expecgted</li>
            <li>and It has completely gone away.</li>
            <li>I have tried literally everything to control my seborrheic dermatitis, from OTC remedies such as Ketoconazole, Selenium Sulfide and Pyrithione Zinc to $350 Clobetasol shampoo, and a whole host of cheaper Rx goops and ointments.  </li>
            <li>a try, I&#x27;d gone for the \\&quot;natural herbal approach\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>I used to wash my hair in the shower with the old shampoo and have to put powder in my hair when I got out of the shower because my hair was still oily.</li>
            <li>This does not make me feel like a friz head, but it keeps my hair soft, while taking the oily feeling away.</li>
            <li>but most importantly - no flaky white stuff on my shoulders.</li>
            <li>But worth the money because he has absolutely no dandruff.</li>
            <li>After one use I felt so much better, and after a few weeks I only scratch my head maybe twice a day.  </li>
            <li>It happens, and unless you just want to live with it you need to find some way to quickly and with as little fuss, get rid of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s borderline okay, using the same active ingredient as Selsun Blue.  </li>
            <li>After a few clean months, I noticed I was getting it again, and decided to try this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I had to upgrade from regular strength to this, and after the first use, I immediately noticed a vast improvement.</li>
            <li>Note that there are two main types of dandruff shampoo: selenium sulfide (like this), and pyrithione zinc (white bottle).</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple dandruff shampoos through the years and this is the only one that consistently works for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve moved to this shampoo from Selsun Blue for two main reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you first use it in the shower, your hair will feel very very dry.</li>
            <li>A long time ago, when I first experienced the dermatitis, it had gotten so bad I developed a fungal infection on my scalp.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have about this product is that the cap on the top is not always easy to open, especially when it is wet.</li>
            <li>As a dude with somewhat long hair it, it really works.  </li>
            <li>After 2-3 washes, my scalp goes back to normal without it flaking or being irritated.</li>
            <li>There were patches on top where it finally was obvious I was missing hair.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I started using regular Head and Shoulders for a few years and my hair was fine.</li>
            <li>I thought itchy scalp was just something I had to live with until I tried a shampoo from Pytho that actually controlled the itching.  </li>
            <li>During times where I am very stressed, my scalp decides to get irritated, itchy, dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>Controls dry skin yet is mild enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>What this does is control dandruff and other related ailments, in my opinion, maybe a little better than the typical pyrithione zinc shampoo, but it comes with it harshness that damage my hair and makes it fall out a bit -- in other words, probably good for occasional use, not daily.</li>
            <li>I have used many different anti dandruff products in the past, including the regular Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo since that has completely eliminated the problem in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li>tried many other products with different active ingredients and nothing worked until this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reading around abit, my experience with this product seems rare, but not completely unique.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair daily, and I still had lots of dandruffs (some of them are rather large with tiny red spots in the middle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I hardly see any more scales (It&#x27;s not completely gone yet, but the itching has stopped).</li>
            <li>Dandruff is generally caused an imbalance of fungi on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of daily use my scalp was completely cleared (I have to use it about once a week now to prevent a reoccurance).</li>
            <li>It is also gentler on my sensitive skin than any prescription strength shampoo or topical stuff I have used.</li>
            <li>The end of the story is the only thing I could identify causing my hair to break off near the scalp</li>
            <li>The second use completely cleared my scalp.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair once and by the end of the week all of the color was gone and back to my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>Actually, that&#x27;s an understatement considering it has completely solved my scalp problems.</li>
            <li>I also have not experienced any notable hair loss from this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The product was, however, extremely effective at reducing itching, so my comfort levels and the number of flakes forced down by scratching were good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a must-have for oily hair types, but it isn&#x27;t overly drying for those with normal or dry hair.</li>
            <li>Selsun is typically the &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; selenium sulfide shampoo utilized for seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff, but this is pretty comparable.</li>
            <li>Have tried many other shampoos in the past.</li>
            <li>I have tried other solutions, but this is the only thing that I have found that consistently gets rid of flakes.</li>
            <li>But it does prevent dandruff quickly and efficiently if you can get past the smell.</li>
            <li>It may very well work wonders with dandruff, but the smell is simply too much to get past.</li>
            <li>and not a single drop had leaked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with natural hair (4b/c</li>
            <li>The one thing I couldn&#x27;t stand was washing my hair with natural products that \\&quot;suppose\\&quot; to help and a couple hours later I&#x27;m back to scratching and seeing the flakes develop (and I wash my hair well).</li>
            <li>Neutrogena seem to perform better, while Jason performed worse than regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m down to using it perhaps 3 or 4 times per week, while using my regular shampoo every other day, and I&#x27;ve remained dandruff free.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from the regular H&amp;S.  No regrets.</li>
            <li>I have been fighting dandruff as long as I can remember &amp; I am 79 years young.</li>
            <li>By the end of the first week, the hairfall was heavier than the first week, my hair was thinning in areas, and each hair was also fragile and thin.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the copper color of the shampoo resembles the dried runoff found on the sidewalk after a storm; reddish-brown with the same distinct smell.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I didn&#x27;t use dandruff shampoo for a few days, and nothing.</li>
            <li>I threw the whole mess out.  </li>
            <li>If this is the case, then my hair should grow back in about 7 months because that&#x27;s roughly the time it takes for a follicle to begin a new growing</li>
            <li>I can actually wear black shirts, and it is all thanks to the selenium sulfide in this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>.. Tried it, works well, cleans right down to the scalp, do not scrub hard, gentle massage technique suggested.</li>

            <li> More pleasant flavour -</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> The fact I could add this to my subscribe and save was amazing.</li>
            <li> Whatever the case, this 1% selenium sulfide concoction is amazing.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, and takes the itch away, but I am still flaking, even after over a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it on my own.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely effective.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and feel, and for the price for 2 bottles, you cant beat.</li>
            <li> While its provided some relief, its not as effective as I&#x27;d have imagined or liked it to be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you have any kind of chemical sensitivities I do not recommend buying.</li>
            <li> It is a nice smell and if it works that is all I care about.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> 14.2 Fl Oz is an excellent product and really gets my hair CLEAN.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Always liked</li>
            <li> It lathers up nice and cleans your hair well</li>
            <li> And you can use a nicer smelling shampoo on the days you don&#x27;t decide to use this kind.</li>
            <li> but it was a nice gesture.</li>
            <li> This is honestly a life saver.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my VERY oily hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, highly recommended to control Seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and a great conditioner!  </li>
            <li> Very good, I&#x27;ve tried many brands and varieties for years and for the first time I&#x27;ve found a product that works!</li>
            <li> I has a very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> and it is very, very strong.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a disagreeable scent and the smell isn&#x27;t very strong either.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great, so I use a good smelling conditioner after, but it&#x27;s very effective all winter long.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Sebhorrheic Dermatitis of the scalp, and by far this is the best OTC product I have found.</li>
            <li> I found it works best in keeping my scalp in check as well as keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found so far in this category.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see the top of my own head,,</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t be able to smell my own hair once my shower is done.</li>
            <li> It really helps!!!very good!</li>
            <li> This really calms my scalp and cleans and smells really good too!</li>
            <li> Price was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be taken in by this too good to be true offer.  </li>
            <li> I will say it has that distinctive Head &amp; Shoulders scent, not really bad or good, but you&#x27;re not going to smell like lilacs unless you use scented conditioner or something.</li>
            <li> All in all I&#x27;d gladly deal with the smell, which can be mask with a little oil and good rinsing, for the awesome results.</li>
            <li> A huge difference!</li>
            <li> I would say it takes time to work, but after using 1 bottle, I am practically flake free!  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I see it works better than to just rinse it off immediately.</li>
            <li> I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every prescription shampoo and medicine on the free market!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for many years now.  </li>
            <li> If I use it once every three days or so, I never have any more issues.  </li>
            <li> I also love Nizoral</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I had a fungal infections on my head and tried evrything and</li>
            <li> , as many know, Nizoral is now no longer OTC.</li>
            <li> Someone on here already said it&#x27;s considered prescription strength, and I can&#x27;t afford too many prescriptions.</li>
            <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 6 months now and my scalp is still blemish free!</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;d probably be better off trying something else.</li>
            <li> I tried many products including many from Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> i used many shampoos.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for much more at this price.</li>
            <li> You understand the struggle that many of us have.</li>
            <li> used the shampoo again and felt better.  </li>
            <li> were GONE from the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will recommend it to anyone I know with dandruff.</li>
            <li> I prefer the selenium sulfide ingredient, but others think pyrithione zinc works better for them.</li>
            <li> The hair looked more healthy with the TGel to after hair dryed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with dandruff on and off most of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I noticed and kept scrubbing my hair with the towel before I ruined my $200</li>
            <li> Works better than any dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s quite an array of interesting reviews for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s quite an array of interesting reviews for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> the two together help control my scalp problem better than anything I have tried before</li>
            <li> so good.the directions says use twice a week or more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews about it changing hair color make sure you thoroughly rise your hair out afterwards.</li>
            <li> It is certainly much better than the tar-based products.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> the price for this item is better for me to buy every 2 mouth.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> have seen many reviews on here that people complain of the smell.</li>
            <li> After a decade of itching, scratching, and embarrassment, I&#x27;m dandruff free!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> The smell could be better, but your will eventually get used to it.</li>
            <li> This is the one works well,  much better than those with Zinc</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> Selenium Sulfide does a much better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does a great job.  </li>
            <li> and i have like 6 moths without dandruff for the first time!!!</li>
            <li> I have had more consistent good results with this one</li>
            <li> One product (T-Gel ) that is supposed to help with Seborrheic Dermatitis makes your head smell like charcoal, not this product, it leaves my husband and sons hair smelling awesome, did i mention it made their hair super soft too?</li>
            <li> This shampoo smell very clean.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely cured, but it&#x27;s still the best thing I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> First, the good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not leave your hair dry and frizzy but excellent for dandruff.</li>
            <li> shampoo is fairly drying, but I rinse it well, use a good conditioner, and only wash every 5 or 6 days.</li>
            <li> While this shampoo also does not have normal shampoo smell, it&#x27;s smell is much more pleasant than Selsun&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad this product is available online</li>
            <li> Like magic, after about 2 months I was dandruff free.</li>
            <li> Itchyness goes away right away and rinses out nicely with no residue and lasts</li>
            <li> If I used Head &amp; Shoulders other versions, I will continue to have dandruff, but this version is the best.</li>
            <li> Best of Head and Shoulders products if you have oily dandruff prone scalp or active dandruff/seborrhea.</li>
            <li> Rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t smell offensive.</li>
            <li> The stench is strong.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, the couple of reviewers that believe it damaged their hair are isolated cases, but it is always a possibility with strong shampoos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s THAT strong.  </li>
            <li> the product may be too strong for your hair.</li>
            <li> It has a light metallic tan colour and a strong medicinal-metallic smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I came in here and wrote a quick review for this product before I forgot again.</li>
            <li> It smells very good, and it is not as strong as Nizoral or any other products used to control dandruff or SD.</li>
            <li> This is a small price to pay for the wonderful way this shampoo keeps my hair clean!</li>
            <li> -- do yourself a huge favor and remove them before you get into the shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That wouldn&#x27;t normally be a huge drawback, but the problem is that the scent will stay on your body for hours or even DAYS...</li>
            <li> Also, I wonder if you were to condition your hair with something lightly scented, whether that might mask the smell?  </li>
            <li> only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t smell too great.</li>
            <li> However, the smell doesn&#x27;t really give me a problem because the conditioner afterwards makes my hair smell nice</li>
            <li> I am so happy i finally found something that works.  </li>
            <li> love the tingle and fresh feeling on my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it</li>
            <li> I used tar shampoos for years with some success but this works better.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this product for his itchy scalp and swears by it, all the sulphate free shampoo&#x27;s don&#x27;t work on his hair...</li>
            <li> Great now my RL towel is COVERED in yellow stains from drying my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to rinse well when using any dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent sufferer of tinea and also have fairly oily skin/hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo - it really works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and really like it.</li>
            <li> Very impressed and such a pleasure to find something that really works</li>
            <li> Not as strong as imagined but not bad either.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it and found that it&#x27;s the best smelling Dandruff Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, and left my long hair nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> The flakes diminished significantly in size as well as in occurrence.</li>
            <li> dandruff that was so persistent for so many years disappeared literally overnight after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brand so much!</li>
            <li> For the price, it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> The product is good for special hair care, but I would not suggest to use the product daily since its strong effect.</li>
            <li> It makes the itchies go away and keeps me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember where I had seen it but in a comparison test it seemed more effective than Selsun Blue.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair clean without stripping the oils.</li>
            <li> I used the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method for well over two years to clean my hair.</li>
            <li> I dont think it is more effective than regular head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I leaves my hair feeling clean and gets all the product out.</li>
            <li> It smells like regular OTC Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo, which is to say, pleasant but not overly sweet or herbal.  </li>
            <li> He enjoyed a certain brand that has now been discontinued so we now use this</li>
            <li> it worked!&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff wasn&#x27;t all that was at stake though, as my hair was naturally very soft, strong, and healthy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a Hard &amp; Shoulder Shampoo this is the best deal.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything special just smells ok.</li>
            <li> I found the clinical strength works a lot better for me, and is as gentle as it says it is.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair super clean and sometimes if I feel tinea coming on I will use it as a body wash</li>
            <li> those looking for a good dandruff treatment that is relatively inexpensive, I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price out there, and when the product that &amp;#34;Ships &amp; Sold by Amazon&amp;#34; went out of stock, the product was only available from third party sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> fast forward today, i tried this variant of H&amp;S and now i&#x27;m dandruff free again!</li>
            <li> I only have to use it once or twice a week to keep everything good.  </li>
            <li> It makes his hair soft and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe people that tell you this stuff reeks or stains towels, clothing, sheets; none of this is true.  </li>
            <li> A great product to try if you do not have other options.</li>
            <li> other than that works great.</li>
            <li> Love the rich texture - leaves hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> It had this peculiar odor that smelled like something that should give you super powers.</li>
            <li> was having dandruff and mild acne issues on neck...cleared both up .</li>
            <li> shampoo has a smell that I personally do not find very appealing.  </li>
            <li> The smell is classic Head &amp; Shoulders - very clean, but not medicinal.</li>
            <li> It soaps better and leaves my hair less fly away than the normal Head and Shoulders shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfy with this product and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I went back, I reported the good news, and he told me to taper off the prescription (which was very strong) onto this specific shampoo.</li>
            <li> But, the second day I seemed to have some kind of irritation from it that gave me mild hives.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, good packaging, got what I expected.</li>
            <li> This shampoo might work for other people with great results, but unfortunately not for me.</li>
            <li> If they would take out the scent I think it would be fine, the regular head and shoulders smelled ok and didn&#x27;t knock you over with the scent.</li>
            <li> Very well packed and delivered on time for free.</li>
            <li> The type of dandruff i have is not the flaking kind, it is more like an accumulation of dead cells stuck to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any H&amp;S product in my life before a few weeks ago, but I bravely purchased this bottle in the hopes it would cure me.  </li>
            <li> but IT WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Even though my experience is rare, it&#x27;s not something you want to pay money to experience.</li>
            <li> I put a fresh towel on my pillow each night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either way, this stuff is worth its weight in gold.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to report that with this product I noticed an almost immediate difference, and somewhere between the first full week and second week of me using it, it completely cleared up my dandruff.</li>
            <li> I remembered using it and figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> worth trying this version of H&amp;S to see if it helps you.</li>
            <li> It is worth mentioning that I do use this product along with Neutrogena&#x27;s T Sal for scalp build up.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing for my super dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for two months and have not lost any hair or incurred temporary baldness due to this product, nor has it otherwise ruined my life or pursuit of happiness.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for two months and have not lost any hair or incurred temporary baldness due to this product, nor has it otherwise ruined my life or pursuit of happiness.  </li>
            <li> The smell, as noted by other reviewers, is overpowering and I&#x27;d advice to give your hair a really good rinsing after you shampoo it to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> even the Dr. didn&#x27;t give the right medicine.</li>
            <li> This shampoo will take the color right out.</li>
            <li> I could tell it was working on her almost right away.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a sulphery after smell that haunts me off and on during the day and makes me feel like I have B.O especially when first stepping out into the sun.  </li>
            <li> It cost more (would LOVE to see the price come down)</li>
            <li> I was bummed actually, because I have been using Nizorail for some time which has been ok, but it no longer works the way it used to, and this was a far better deal as a 2 pack.</li>
            <li> Usually buy these in store, but there was a great deal on here with a $3 off coupon.  </li>
            <li> Normal Head and Shoulders smells really clean and fresh in the shower and then, once out of the shower, you don&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
            <li> It was also something I could use much more often than Nizorail (which recommended not using it for more than a few weeks at a</li>
            <li> i really like this shampoo very much!</li>
            <li> For all the hundreds I&#x27;ve spent, it&#x27;s an amazing relief to have this stuff work so damn well.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped my husband&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> I like darker shades, so it was even more obvious.</li>
            <li> My oncologist recommended this shampoo and after the first time I used it, I felt the difference.  </li>
            <li> I bought it and the first time I used it it did get rid of my dandruff</li>
            <li> But like me, if you have SD, you&#x27;re willing to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried it tonight for the first time.  </li>
            <li> The olfactory assault is a bit overwhelming -- especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> update this review in a couple of months with further results.&lt;br /&gt;Found more than one article on the Internet suggesting the use of Baking Soda as a shampoo since it is supposed to remove accumulated gels, sprays, etc</li>
            <li> I have two bottles of this and probably won&#x27;t even use the second one, going to give it a couple more weeks</li>
            <li> Results can be seen the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> That my first product I tried  and</li>
            <li> According to my dermatologist, the way to keep seb derm under control is to rotate, so use this and others throughout the week to \\&quot;confuse\\&quot; your scalp into behaving, while not allowing it to adapt to one consistent method of treatment.  </li>
            <li> I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice &#x3D;].&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice &#x3D;].&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> If bread and butter Head &amp; Shoulders doesn&#x27;t quite do the trick for you, you might want to try this, but it doesn&#x27;t work significantly better to justify its potential drawbacks in my experience.</li>
            <li> (the first week)&amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly expensive and anyone commenting on the smell is just being a jerk.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength is the only shampoo that was able to keep my hair from getting oily.</li>
            <li> Seborrheic dermatitis can result from one or more of several factors.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure will continue to keep it away for the foreseeable future.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Head &amp; Shoulders!</li>
            <li> In fact, noticed difference after first use.</li>
            <li> Noticed difference after first use</li>
            <li> husband and son have been using it for about 2 weeks now and it seems to really be helping!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say enough about how pleased I am with it.</li>
            <li> Been trying many brands, only this one works!</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and light.</li>
            <li> The odor itself might be pleasant enough if it simply weren&#x27;t so STRONG.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved how natural it was, and how it helped my hair with not needing a wash every single day.</li>
            <li> The bottles came fast and ironically right before I was going to take a shower after a workout.  </li>
            <li> It has a very clean smell to it, I get complements on its smell constantly.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this product, selenium sulfide, is effective at killing off the fungi.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will clear completely up in another week or so</li>
            <li> new and great no more flakes</li>
            <li> Nothing worked and I was positive</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair more flake and itch free than regular Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> For the whole three weeks, it was pretty effective at keeping dandruff levels down, by the day after I had showered, medium-sized flakes about the size of a rice grain would begin to reappear.</li>
            <li> My scalp still has flakes, but now they are normal sized ones that are present on every healthy scalp (skin sheds, remember) that aren&#x27;t unsightly and that get on everything.</li>
            <li> Dandruff and dry scalp was a lot better.  </li>
            <li> Works on most dry patchy skin problems.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the smell of the Nutragena T-gel extra strengh with the coal tar even though that is strong to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, even on the first wash, I experienced heavy hairfall, but not enough to make me overly nervous.</li>
            <li> It smells nice at first and then about a second later you get the chemical burn in your nose and throat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling severe dandruff for a few months now and after 2 weeks of using this product I&#x27;m 99% dandruff free!!</li>
            <li> If Selsun blue smell is too strong for you, try this; it works very well.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was very subtle however it gets more and more noticeable as you use it.</li>
            <li> Good Dandruff Shampoo and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this shampoo, I no longer host a ski resort on my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We really like the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very smelly.</li>
            <li> Product leaves a sticky residue on my scalp and hands; on anything it touches really.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This could very well cause a divorce in our house.  </li>
            <li> For years I had problems with a really itchy scalp and plucking off skin that was the size on an eraser head, after using this product it has no happened again.</li>
            <li> None could control the itch in any reasonable degree.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> People regularly compliment me on the scent of my hair, and I&#x27;m dandruff free.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I contacted the manufacturer about this bizarre issue but their only suggestion was to remove my jewelry before using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders uses way too much perfume in this product.  </li>
            <li> Still this is so much cheaper</li>
            <li> I was getting ready to go to a doctor and maybe try some sort of prescription when I found this.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> Honestly, an absolute nightmare.</li>
            <li> H&amp;S Clinical Strength really helped me, and I give it my wholehearted recommendation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> And, to his credit, I&#x27;ve remained dandruff free for almost 2 years on the combination of Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength for my daily wash, and the prescription once or twice a month.</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> My scalp started to become very itchy and dandruffy</li>
            <li> hair is cleaned very well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works to get that dandruff out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty</li>
            <li> I am free at last!</li>
            <li> I really like this for dandruff.  </li>
            <li> She smelled like a dude for a day, but this really took care of the cradle cap.  </li>
            <li> It really does what it says.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overal, highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed in this product as I expected more from this brand.  </li>
            <li> Simply put, this shampoo is hands down the best thing I have tried to get rid of my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I refuse to use any other shampoo but head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does a better job on dandruff than any other over-the-counter shampoo.</li>
            <li> Compared to other products, I fell highly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely oily hair, I do not know of a better product that this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cheaper than many of the other dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li> so I use this 2 times a week to deep clean and sooth my scalp.</li>
            <li> AMAZING,,, no more gunk in the ears.. cracking on face cleared up by the nose.  </li>
            <li> But after the first wash, it was about 50% clear.</li>
            <li> The first use almost completely cleared up the dermatitis and got rid of all the dandruff.</li>
            <li> The version offered on Amazon&#x27;s site is 1% Ketoconazole, prescription is 2%, (about $29) really not sure if that would make a substantial difference in how effective it is but decided to try the Head and Shoulders Clinical instead.</li>
            <li> At first I though I was being self conscious.</li>
            <li> The best part is, it doesn&#x27;t smell atrocious like most of the other anti-dandruff shampoos do, it is more or less odorless.</li>
            <li> OK (neither particularly bad or good), but</li>
            <li> My family also commented that my hair looked thinner and certainly less healthy.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t quick enough for me</li>
            <li> Smells strong of chemicals and not much improvement for my scalp.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why attribute 80&amp; of my current scalp situation to this H&amp;S product and I super highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I normally use another cheap shampoo to get the hair wet and ready for this to soak in.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo to those who are looking for relief for stubborn dandruff.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> High recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and b) I read that it can cause hair loss in high doses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone suffering from dandruff.</li>
            <li> I always used the Clinical Strength Head and Shoulders when I was in high school</li>
            <li> I have been reading something about rotating dandruff shampoos that use different active ingredients to help control a powerful scalp problem, so I may include either a different brand or a different line within the same brand to ensure I remain flake free for good.</li>
            <li> It solves my sensitive hair better than other products.</li>
            <li> I did, however, decided to change my conditioner to something a bit more hydrating and strengthening  because I started to feel my hair go a little bit dryer.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING at the drugstore (including every single H&amp;S product) to solve my dandruff/scalp build up problems and it isn&#x27;t until I&#x27;ve found this product that I have seen a significant result.</li>
            <li> shampoo is generally effective at controlling (or at least reducing the severity of) severe seborrheic dermatitis (seb derm).  </li>
            <li> The smell is really powerful, especially in summer, and has a sulfuric odor to it.</li>
            <li> The symptoms have not gone away, but it&#x27;s definitely more effective than all the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried (Head and Shoulders Dry Scalp Care Shampoo; Nizoral (ketoconazole); Dead Sea sea salt; Triamcinolone Acetonide;</li>
            <li> I imagine after a little more time, those areas will clear up too.</li>
            <li> your head smells after using this product you might need a new head.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried hot oil treatments, various pomades to try and seal in moisture, which helped some, but my scalp was still horrendously itchy.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I noticed a BIG difference after the first shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have scalp issues and this is the only shampoo that will work for me consistently.  </li>
            <li> My only advice is to try the cheaper shampoo first before moving up to ones that cost 15 or 30 dollars a bottle.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would leave a review for dandruff shampoo, or any other shampoo for that matter, but this is worth it!  </li>
            <li> I decided to finally try this one, not thinking it would do any better than all the other brands I&#x27;ve used for 35 years.  </li>
            <li> Controls my dandruff quite well, and smells better than the other blue brand you might know.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo, I noticed a big reduction in itching and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> more flakes, no more itching,</li>
            <li> After one use, the dandruff reduced almost completely!</li>
            <li> The only shampoo that consistently meets my needs.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this shampoo because my hair did not feel clean after using other products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, instead of smelling like something pleasant, it has an \\&quot;I-use-budget-shampoo\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> just recently decided to try the Clinical Strength Head &amp; Shoulders, and as I said I&#x27;ve tried the less potent stuff before to no avail.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I wash my hair (pretty much every other day)</li>
            <li> Selsun Blue has a different active ingredient which may be better in your particular situation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the hairfall was due to the selenium sulfide (selenium can cause hairloss in high doses) and the many sorts of sulphur-based detergents (which can be extremely drying, causing hair to snap near the root).</li>
            <li> I would try one bottle at least to make sure you have time to let it adjust and settle in.</li>
            <li> I became natural in 2009, but after I had my baby in 2010</li>
            <li> Not to mention I was trying to stay with consuming natural products, but they did not work and believe it or not tea tree did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> Since going natural, I&#x27;ve tried to stay away from laureth sulfate products, but if this product is stopping the itchiness and scaling, I guess me and laureth sulfates are friends and my natural hair doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with it.  </li>
            <li> I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter Khoret Amen Hair Smoothie for my deep conditioner (don&#x27;t care too much for the smell though, but it works).</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis when I was a young teenager.</li>
            <li> Wow one time use and it was gone.</li>
            <li> It works well and your hair feels soft after use.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working as advertized.</li>
            <li> Just use it daily for awhile till you don&#x27;t think you need it as much</li>
            <li> looking for the old formula...works as expecgted</li>
            <li> and It has completely gone away.</li>
            <li> I have tried literally everything to control my seborrheic dermatitis, from OTC remedies such as Ketoconazole, Selenium Sulfide and Pyrithione Zinc to $350 Clobetasol shampoo, and a whole host of cheaper Rx goops and ointments.  </li>
            <li> a try, I&#x27;d gone for the \\&quot;natural herbal approach\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair in the shower with the old shampoo and have to put powder in my hair when I got out of the shower because my hair was still oily.</li>
            <li> This does not make me feel like a friz head, but it keeps my hair soft, while taking the oily feeling away.</li>
            <li> but most importantly - no flaky white stuff on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> But worth the money because he has absolutely no dandruff.</li>
            <li> After one use I felt so much better, and after a few weeks I only scratch my head maybe twice a day.  </li>
            <li> It happens, and unless you just want to live with it you need to find some way to quickly and with as little fuss, get rid of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s borderline okay, using the same active ingredient as Selsun Blue.  </li>
            <li> After a few clean months, I noticed I was getting it again, and decided to try this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had to upgrade from regular strength to this, and after the first use, I immediately noticed a vast improvement.</li>
            <li> Note that there are two main types of dandruff shampoo: selenium sulfide (like this), and pyrithione zinc (white bottle).</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple dandruff shampoos through the years and this is the only one that consistently works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved to this shampoo from Selsun Blue for two main reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you first use it in the shower, your hair will feel very very dry.</li>
            <li> A long time ago, when I first experienced the dermatitis, it had gotten so bad I developed a fungal infection on my scalp.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this product is that the cap on the top is not always easy to open, especially when it is wet.</li>
            <li> As a dude with somewhat long hair it, it really works.  </li>
            <li> After 2-3 washes, my scalp goes back to normal without it flaking or being irritated.</li>
            <li> There were patches on top where it finally was obvious I was missing hair.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I started using regular Head and Shoulders for a few years and my hair was fine.</li>
            <li> I thought itchy scalp was just something I had to live with until I tried a shampoo from Pytho that actually controlled the itching.  </li>
            <li> During times where I am very stressed, my scalp decides to get irritated, itchy, dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Controls dry skin yet is mild enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> What this does is control dandruff and other related ailments, in my opinion, maybe a little better than the typical pyrithione zinc shampoo, but it comes with it harshness that damage my hair and makes it fall out a bit -- in other words, probably good for occasional use, not daily.</li>
            <li> I have used many different anti dandruff products in the past, including the regular Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo since that has completely eliminated the problem in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> tried many other products with different active ingredients and nothing worked until this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reading around abit, my experience with this product seems rare, but not completely unique.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair daily, and I still had lots of dandruffs (some of them are rather large with tiny red spots in the middle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I hardly see any more scales (It&#x27;s not completely gone yet, but the itching has stopped).</li>
            <li> Dandruff is generally caused an imbalance of fungi on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of daily use my scalp was completely cleared (I have to use it about once a week now to prevent a reoccurance).</li>
            <li> It is also gentler on my sensitive skin than any prescription strength shampoo or topical stuff I have used.</li>
            <li> The end of the story is the only thing I could identify causing my hair to break off near the scalp</li>
            <li> The second use completely cleared my scalp.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair once and by the end of the week all of the color was gone and back to my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> Actually, that&#x27;s an understatement considering it has completely solved my scalp problems.</li>
            <li> I also have not experienced any notable hair loss from this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The product was, however, extremely effective at reducing itching, so my comfort levels and the number of flakes forced down by scratching were good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for oily hair types, but it isn&#x27;t overly drying for those with normal or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Selsun is typically the &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; selenium sulfide shampoo utilized for seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff, but this is pretty comparable.</li>
            <li> Have tried many other shampoos in the past.</li>
            <li> I have tried other solutions, but this is the only thing that I have found that consistently gets rid of flakes.</li>
            <li> But it does prevent dandruff quickly and efficiently if you can get past the smell.</li>
            <li> It may very well work wonders with dandruff, but the smell is simply too much to get past.</li>
            <li> and not a single drop had leaked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural hair (4b/c</li>
            <li> The one thing I couldn&#x27;t stand was washing my hair with natural products that \\&quot;suppose\\&quot; to help and a couple hours later I&#x27;m back to scratching and seeing the flakes develop (and I wash my hair well).</li>
            <li> Neutrogena seem to perform better, while Jason performed worse than regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m down to using it perhaps 3 or 4 times per week, while using my regular shampoo every other day, and I&#x27;ve remained dandruff free.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from the regular H&amp;S.  No regrets.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting dandruff as long as I can remember &amp; I am 79 years young.</li>
            <li> By the end of the first week, the hairfall was heavier than the first week, my hair was thinning in areas, and each hair was also fragile and thin.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the copper color of the shampoo resembles the dried runoff found on the sidewalk after a storm; reddish-brown with the same distinct smell.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I didn&#x27;t use dandruff shampoo for a few days, and nothing.</li>
            <li> I threw the whole mess out.  </li>
            <li> If this is the case, then my hair should grow back in about 7 months because that&#x27;s roughly the time it takes for a follicle to begin a new growing</li>
            <li> I can actually wear black shirts, and it is all thanks to the selenium sulfide in this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> .. Tried it, works well, cleans right down to the scalp, do not scrub hard, gentle massage technique suggested.</li>
            <li> As an added benefit, this shampoo is relatively concentrated and works in very well, so you can use less with each washing and stretch your dollar even farther!</li>
            <li> to make sure I can reach my scalp properly, and leave the shampoo on my head for at least five minutes (usually closer to 10 minutes).</li>
            <li> While other items in the box exploded (Old Space Body Wash 3-Pack)</li>
            <li> It burns my eyes LESS than other shampoos and usually not at all !!!  </li>
            <li> None of them ever completely cured the problem but they helped enough I wouldn&#x27;t die of embarrassment when I wore a dark shirt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For reference; 21 y/o caucasian male with dark, natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d made cursory efforts here and there to deal with it, including using other shampoos of this type, including other versions of this very brand.</li>
            <li> But be aware your head is going to have a weird chemical-medicine smell for a day or so after, no matter how much you rinse.</li>
            <li> It may very well work, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I know, that&#x27;s strange since it&#x27;s actually for a skin issue.</li>
            <li> By week three, I had developed two small line of baldness on the sides of my head, similar to the very, very early stages of male pattern baldness (similar to Norwood-Hamilton level 2, but with a deeper, slender lines down either side).</li>
            <li> If regular dandruff shampoo or dry scalp shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to work for you try this.  </li>
            <li> My dry scalp problem disappeared in about a week when using this daily.</li>
            <li> so I actually got this to use on dry skin that I have on the sides of my nose and forehead.  </li>
            <li> I have been dealing with this for 30+ years, the skin would get so dry it would flake and peal leaving my face with embarrassing  red patches on my face.</li>
            <li> I finally discovered that all dandruff shampoos were not created equal and that some used different active ingredients.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my husband who has been rotating various dandruff shampoos with different active ingredients.</li>
            <li> Fwiw, regular Selsun Blue (which features the same active ingredient at perhaps a lower strength by default) didn&#x27;t do the trick, but this stuff did.  </li>
            <li> the Head and Shoulders rep said &#x27;Sorry, the product is too strong for your hair&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> My son used it too and said it made him stink so bad he showered again with another product  just to be able to stand himself!</li>
            <li> The really thick areas of my head on the back and sides still have build-up but my hair is so super thick, I know not enough of it is getting thru or left on long enough to get rid of those areas.  </li>
            <li> People who have suffered from this likely remember the only prescription shampoo that worked reliably was Capitrol, which was taken off the market due to lack of demand.</li>
            <li> I always dread using it, but unfortunately there aren&#x27;t many other choices.</li>
            <li> I alternate this clinical strength with Selenium in it with regular Head and Shoulders every other day...</li>
            <li> I would wash my hair daily, I&#x27;d wash it every other day, I would skip conditioner, I would use extra conditioner.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is selenium sulfide: it works like Selsun Blue, smells like Selsun Blue, but it seems a bit cheaper considering the volume (?).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I have long hair that wraps around my nose.</li>
            <li> (which is every other day, unless I am doing something that requires an immediate wash, such as exercising) as recommended on the bottle.</li>
            <li> the dandruff returns back, even my hair dresser recommended other brands that I tested but no way.</li>
            <li> have not used extensively, but I have used other head and shoulder products and like them.</li>
            <li> I learned a lesson about reading reviews before buying, even from big brands, I just hope I don&#x27;t get bald spots like some of the other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually never tried any other product that&#x27;s meant to compete with this one.</li>
            <li> thing though is that it will dry your hair, so to prevent it from feeling and looking like straw</li>
            <li> Still leaves an itchy scalp, albeit not as dry as before.</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry out the scalp</li>
            <li> I know I have dry skin sometimes.  </li>
            <li> the ears were not producing that powdered dry skin</li>
            <li> The persistent dry flakes always stuck to my scalp</li>
            <li> I use it in the winter as it gets dry</li>
            <li> The product has enough of the active ingredient in it to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried all different kinds of shampoos (pyrithione zinc, coal tar, salicylic acid) and they would work for a few days and my flakes would come back with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I am giving this such a low review is that this shampoo will give every part of your body it touches a very very weird and distinct odor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5-6 years every single day</li>
            <li> With the first use this shampoo decreased my dandruff and itchiness.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel like I had much to loose.</li>
            <li> only use this shampoo a few times a year when my other shampoos occasionally lose their effectiveness</li>
            <li> When I cut back to a couple of times a week, that problem should be less.</li>
            <li> tried Garnier Dandraff shampoo, Neutrogena T-Gel, Jason scalp therapy, and even some African black shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Enter H&amp;S Clinical Strength - my scalp stays fresher longer, much less red bumps</li>
            <li> The scalp was starting to feel odd.</li>
            <li> If you normally use head and shoulders youll notice it says not for everyday this one says everyday.</li>
            <li> Does help with the odd bumps and itching scalp that happens especially in warmer, humid months of the year.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands, I tried other H&amp;S products, but my scalp still itched relentlessly and I was constantly having to dust myself off.</li>
            <li> To fix this, I always use conditioner on the bottom half of my hair (and especially the ends but never the scalp because of how oily my hair is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a very dry flaky scalp and have tried a ton of products to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I tried less shampoo, more shampoo, conditioner, even cutting off my bleaching routine on my hair</li>
            <li> I even mix a little tea tree oil for an extra boost and a tea tree conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair and have had it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> sometimes my hair is dry, other times greasy.  </li>
            <li> Works great, smells terrible.</li>
            <li> I massaged it into my scalp for a minute, let it sit for at least six minutes, and then rinsed it off completely.</li>
            <li> I am giving a middling review, because I am not sure what it has done, but detracting two stars for its capacity to turn my very white grey hair blond.</li>
            <li> So take careful notice of your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s designed to not be rough on your hair too.</li>
            <li> Expected this shampoo to be stronger for my Seborrheic Dermatitis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very medicinal at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last few years and have sworn by it.</li>
            <li> I started getting some rough dandruff on my hairline.  </li>
            <li> When I stopped using it, my entire scalp was covered with scales of dead skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of those shampoos I tried before finding the H&amp;S Clinical Strength and never really stopped using.</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s a little more expensive than what you&#x27;d pay in the store, but it&#x27;s the price of convenience, I guess!</li>
            <li> About a year ago, I tried out H&amp;S Clinical Strength as a last defense (and I mean last - I&#x27;d given my friend&#x27;s medicated shampoos</li>
            <li> My scalp was ridiculously ichty which left white residue under my finger nails.</li>
            <li> It is less than half the price and the bottle is MUCH bigger.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried just about every shampoo around, (regular H&amp;S, Neutrogena T-Gel, Selsun Blue, just to name a few) and this seems to be the only one that tames my poor husband&#x27;s dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have been checking regularly since the past few weeks and thankfully it is back as a product  &amp;#34;Ships &amp;</li>
            <li> Lacks a strong (unpleasant) scent like some other medicated shampoos.</li>
            <li> Working in a very dry climate daily, on top of gym workouts is brutal on a scalp.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to a new city with extremely poor water quality and within a few months my scalp was always itching and flaking.  </li>
            <li> Seems to have gotten worse as I grew older.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed and you&#x27;ll soon notice a difference in your hair health. :)</li>
            <li> After seeing this reviewed somewhere I decided to give it a try, even though other versions of Head and Shoulders did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> If you have tried all other product and nothing has worked this might be the answer.  </li>
            <li> so i experimented with other shampoos again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had ANY other shampoo or skin care product do this.  </li>
            <li> (one is zinc-based and the other is tar-based).  </li>
            <li> and I tried all sorts of other products and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> If one doesn&#x27;t work for you, try the other.</li>
            <li> When I have used, I must wash hair again with other to remove coloring.</li>
            <li> It does control dandruff but not significantly more than regular dandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li> giving it three stars because I know that other people may benefit from this</li>
            <li> but I do have extremely greasy hair and an itchy scalp</li>
            <li> It stops my dandruff which was never cleaned by other products.</li>
            <li> my husbands scalp isnt as red where it usually breaks out anymore and dandruff is practically gone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I tried other shampoo&#x27;s this oe does the job.</li>
            <li> it helps with my dry scalp and my itching a 100%!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this and have been using for about two weeks, it definitely is not improving over the standard hand and shoulders and I might even say it is making it worse.  </li>
            <li> Typically my towels won&#x27;t smell until they are wet, but once they get any moisture on them, they start to smell like sulfur (I presume from the selenium sulfide?).</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is 1% selenium sulfide.</li>
            <li> If your shampoo isn&#x27;t working to combat your dandruff, look at the bottle to see what the active ingredient is.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after reading all the positive reviews, I decided that I need to try</li>
            <li> I dont have dandruff, initially bought for dog with sebohrrea but afraid to use it on him, apparently dogs shouldnt use human shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo every other day for about a month and a half now</li>
            <li> shampoo is definitely Not the &#x27;No Tears&#x27; version, hard to wash and let it sit for 5 minutes in the shower.</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY shampoo that combats the dandruff we get from hard water.  </li>
            <li> At this strength it was hard to find in local pharmacy chain.</li>
            <li> really wanted this to work, and was sorry I had to pass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still recommend it as a secondary regular shampoo when you don&#x27;t need the hassle of a prescription.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there isn&#x27;t a 2-in-1 Clinical Strength version of Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definately not worth the damage it has done to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells good in the bottle but after my husband shampooed with it his hair smelled AWFUL!</li>
            <li> I use a little gel, no sprays, conditioners or other treatments.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The way other reviewers carried on, I was prepared for it to smell like hell!  </li>
            <li> It smelled like sulfur, or in other words, rotten eggs!.</li>
            <li> I have been told I have a few other skin problems</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo as directed, every other day when I shower (office jobs - saving water since whenever office jobs were invented), and then I condition with Tresemme Conditioner Luxurious Moisture once a week because the water and bleaching also dried out the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, unlike some other anti-dandruff shampoos, this one does not have a harsh chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I switched to an expensive salon-type shampoo about 6 months ago, and over that time I have seen all the short sticks of hair around my hairline start growing back.</li>
            <li> I discovered that this shampoo turns my sterling silver jewelry BLACK.  </li>
            <li> Slightly oily hair, but flaky scalp...</li>
            <li> Perhaps oddly to some</li>
            <li> You can get this for less than 7 a bottle, and you DON&#x27;T have to use it every hair wash.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit harsh, but it works on my scalp when other products wont.</li>
            <li> Might smell a little off at time</li>
            <li> Protip: if you have seb derm on the face or sideburns, a little of the lather from this will get rid of it as well.  </li>
            <li> Protip: if you have seb derm on the face or sideburns, a little of the lather from this will get rid of it as well.  </li>
            <li> If you get little pimples along your hairline I would also recommend using this shampoo for that</li>
            <li> About 50% of my scalp is affected (ranging from the front of the scalp to the back of the head) and this product seems to be less irritating than others.</li>
            <li> Suffered from dry scalp, itching, dandruff, but no more!</li>
            <li> The only shampoo that works with tough dandruff.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m always afraid someone will mix nair into it, so i test it on a small area first.</li>
            <li> I do leave it on a few minutes as stated</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I am constantly trying to hide the thin patches showing my scalp anymore.     </li>
            <li> Never again and also when you stop using it your dandruff comes back and worse that before.</li>
            <li> I just use this as my everyday shampoo and keep a bottle in my locker at the club for my after workout shampoos as well.  </li>
            <li> that has been a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday or even every week because a) I don&#x27;t need to now</li>
            <li> I get dried skin cracking where the nose meets the face.  </li>
            <li> I get it on my scalp and soak for a  few minutes to let it work.  </li>
            <li> I promptly tossed this bottle of garbage into the waste bin.</li>
            <li> Too harsh on the hair though it fights dandruff.</li>
            <li> it did take a few washes but it did work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few products</li>
            <li> only got worse.  </li>
            <li> I use shampoos that aren&#x27;t as harsh, until I get dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Lather it into your hair, massage it into your scalp and let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I used it on and off for a few months</li>
            <li> Just use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff for years and after just a few days this cleared it up.</li>
            <li> I had very bad dandruff before and most of it is gone now and my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel itchy.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use this shampoo a few times a year (between 4-6), but I have used it on and off for a few years.</li>
            <li> before this product I had pretty bad dandruff problems.</li>
            <li> DISCOVERED WALMART BRAND 50% LESS BUT STILL HARD TO FIND SELENIUM PRODUCT</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think the smell is bad at all (actually brings back some memories of practicing choir music before school).</li>
            <li> I feel self-conscious about the smell as it seems to linger for at least half an hour after rinsing, but have been told by others that they don&#x27;t smell a thing.</li>
            <li> I had horrible dandruff and tried every treatment I could find...from $40 bottles of medicated shampoo to tea tree oil, nothing worked (in fact, most things actually made it worse!).</li>
            <li> but after about 4 -5 times of using it my hair started to fall out excessively</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve had no more flakes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find one with selenium sulfide (same as in Selsun Gold, which I can&#x27;t find anymore), so I&#x27;ve ordered two bottles through Amazon for him.  </li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis, troubled with an itchy scalp, small red bumps, lots of dandruff, oily scalp and the scalp turning stinky after every couple of days.</li>
            <li> Specifically, it smells like dirty creek water (just like the creeks I&#x27;ve been near in my backyard or on golf courses).</li>
            <li> but I am not sure.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is killing off a fungus among us or what.  </li>
            <li> I just rub on a small amount as I get in shower and rinse off when done.</li>
            <li> no more redness AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> No more flakes, no more itching,</li>
            <li> no more redness AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> So I am not sure if it does work on dandruff, wish I could find out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a property inherent in selenium sulfide that makes all shampoos of this class smell so clinical.</li>
            <li> I can usually go 2-3 days without shampooing</li>
            <li> As did the unbelievable itching</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not a magical cure for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I could find a bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders that cost $8.00</li>
            <li> Then things quickly go from bad to worse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my scalp retaliated and I kept trying to use different natural methods to clear up the horrible dandruff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After one use, no kidding, my seb derm was almost under control--itching gone, redness almost gone, very few flakes remaining.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very heavily perfumed smell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is also (usually) less expensive than those other products by volume, too.</li>
            <li> I have tried the regular strength Head &amp; Shoulders but after a few tries, my scalp just goes back to being irritated and disgusting (to say the least).</li>
            <li> This stuff really does wonders for my dandruff, but I only use it about once every week or two weeks because it makes everything my hair touches smell awful.</li>
            <li> I found it extremely difficult to work into my hair (which is rather thick and coarse), and hard to rinse out because of its texture.</li>
            <li> Its just smells bad but not right out of the bottle only after being on the scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird sensation because it feels almost like your hair is dry, yet it is in a running shower.</li>
            <li> O was really hopeful that this would help me for my really bad dandruff, but if anything is just made it worse :/</li>
            <li> I have had bad psoriasis and was always self conscious of wearing black/dark shirts.  </li>
            <li> Does the job ok but stinks like crap.</li>
            <li> This shampoo absolutely sucks.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint</li>
            <li> My husband was using the regular Head &amp; Shoulders and it wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> Since the bottle is only used when it is wet, it can be annoying.</li>
            <li> Washing my hair every day didn&#x27;t do anything but strip my scalp of the few oils that it did have, and made my dandruff even worse.</li>
            <li> (my poor now-brown hair is crying over that decision still).  </li>
            <li> No more itch!</li>
            <li> Seriously, people.</li>
            <li> I have serious itching and flaking from Seb.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> , I have serious problems on my skin</li>
            <li> Despite containing sulfur, it actually doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried other Head and Shoulder product that haven&#x27;t worked at all, an left me very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was suffering from terrible seborrheic dermititis, wait first of all</li>
            <li> It is very hard to describe, the closet description i can think of is a bunch of medication for elderly people.</li>
            <li> I have a bad dry scalp and head and shoulders keep it under control.</li>
            <li> product, itself, is very thick, I&#x27;d almost call it gooey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that bad at all.</li>
            <li> so the sweat in my hair made the itching worse.  </li>
            <li> I tried tons of zinc based products before this, and they ranged from doing nothing to making things MUCH worse.</li>
            <li> I get my box in Miami all broken and watered</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s completely unnecessary to the formula.</li>
            <li> She also told me to wash my face, eyebrows etc in this shampoo in case dandruff was irritating my Blepharitis</li>
            <li> and my SD got much worse.</li>
            <li> I tried all the usual suspects including cold tar shampoos to no avail.  </li>
            <li> my hair/scalp went through a transformation and I developed scales and awful itching.</li>
            <li> Bad dandruff and dry scalp made me scratch my head like crazy.</li>
            <li> This has a very bad smell that stays on your hair even after your hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> Be wary when you buy this product.</li>
            <li> I also went to my doctor and we did some test like for thyroid, etc., but there was nothing wrong.    </li>
            <li> That, coupled with oily scalp, makes controlling my condition difficult.</li>
            <li> at the 2% concentration, which is unfortunately prescription stuff in America.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that shampoo was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find selenium sulfide shampoo that doesn&#x27;t smell like menthol, herbs, or a man&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like tar like some do, it smells like you sprayed febreeze at your nose or sniffed those fake air fresheners that are &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to smell like linen or cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cost a lot so try it before u use all this expensive product out there.</li>
            <li> I pored over the reviews before purchase, and was a bit skeptical, but for the $13 or so that I paid, I figured what the heck.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has had trouble with annoying dandruff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> but this the Clinical Strength Head and Shoulders has totally taken care of it - without an awful smell.  </li>
            <li> Not only my dandruff is gone, but my hair doesnt have that horrible greasy-sticky look.</li>
            <li> First off, it smells horrible, why it has to smell like crap is beyond me.</li>
            <li> Bad the shampoo arrived broken, I need my money back,was not well packaged</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair, so those flakes are horrible and it&#x27;s not extemely expensive.</li>
            <li> The price was crazy (around $23 for 2 bottles).</li>
            <li> I get this nasty dried skin in the curls of my ears.  </li>
            <li> I do not agree that it stinks.  </li>
            <li> I even tried crazy home remedies like olive oil scalp soaks, etc.  </li>
            <li> Then, a few months ago, I started getting really awful flakes again.</li>
            <li> but I was desperate since nothing else was working.  </li>
            <li> It smells unpleasant and the smell lingers in your hair for days.</li>
            <li> but it was very expensive.</li>
            <li> I used to have dandruff that was so bad</li>
            <li> The scent of this product isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I think it is probably just a matter of hair type not that the shampoo is inherently bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so bad it makes me want to throw up when my husband uses it.  </li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and my scalp is bad in the winter.</li>
            <li> my hair never smelled bad again</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the bad stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re talking &amp;#34;looks like snow on my shoulders&amp;#34; level of bad.</li>
            <li> Not that bad, but not something I like to smell all day.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t notice any particularly bad smell - I&#x27;m not picky about how my shampoo&#x27;s scented, but I can verify that this is neither bad nor strong.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Fall I had a bad case of dandruff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some complaints about the smell, but I don&#x27;t think its that bad.  </li>
            <li> and I had it bad.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use it on my baby when she had really bad cradle cap...</li>
            <li> It stinks !</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I hate head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell though.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even rinse this crap out of my hair, it felt like I had spiking pomade stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a really, really bad oily hair with horrible dandrunff.</li>
            <li> However, if your goal is to get rid of a bad hair-dyed color, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because it has a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> Now I have a bald spot on my head and it looks terrible.</li>
            <li> So disgusting.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel horrible... Will not try this again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible dandruff since I was a child.</li>
            <li> I tried for years to find shampoo that I could use that didn&#x27;t cause me to have horrible dandruff.</li>
            <li> For those with experience, coal tar shampoo smells absolutely terrible, this stuff smells like spring meadows compared to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was having a terrible problem with dandruff</li>
            <li> I still have flakes and they are AWFUL.  </li>
            <li> hope P&amp;G addresses this awful, awful smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried rinsing my hair our for 2-3 minutes after shampooing, but my towels still smell awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo every other day for about a month and a half now and I have to say it&#x27;s really helped. I had very bad dandruff before and most of it is gone now and my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel itchy. The smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant but I&#x27;ve definitely smelled worse.&lt;br /&gt;One thing though is that it will dry your hair, so to prevent it from feeling and looking like straw I use a moisturizing spray after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many different anti dandruff products in the past, including the regular Head &amp; Shoulders. thi is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this shampoo, I no longer host a ski resort on my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, go see a dermatologist. Seriously, people. Don&#x27;t get all your information on medicinal products from commercials.</li>
            <li> I have had bad psoriasis and was always self conscious of wearing black/dark shirts.  I would say it takes time to work, but after using 1 bottle, I am practically flake free!  Smell and color aren&#x27;t the best, but i&#x27;ll trade it for an itchless scalp &#x3D;)  I would try one bottle at least to make sure you have time to let it adjust and settle in.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my husband&#x27;s hair! He enjoyed a certain brand that has now been discontinued so we now use this and I believe it helps even more than the one he used to use! We really like the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good amount in the bottle and with this listing, you receive 2 bottles! For a very good price, I might add. You won&#x27;t find a good bargain like this in the stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re suffering from dandruff, or even just wanting to prevent the start of it- I suggest you buy you some of this- you won&#x27;t be disappointed and you&#x27;ll soon notice a difference in your hair health. :)</li>
            <li> I used to have dandruff that was so bad it got all over my sheets and my clothes. I like darker shades, so it was even more obvious. I tried generic anti dandruff shampoos that simply didn&#x27;t do anything. Washing my hair every day didn&#x27;t do anything but strip my scalp of the few oils that it did have, and made my dandruff even worse. I have tried hot oil treatments, various pomades to try and seal in moisture, which helped some, but my scalp was still horrendously itchy. I finally discovered that all dandruff shampoos were not created equal and that some used different active ingredients. This brand of anti dandruff shampoo used Selenium Sulfide, as opposed to Zinc Pyrithione, which was doing nothing for me, so I decided to try it. Wow! I noticed a BIG difference after the first shampoo. No more itch! I was so happy. The flakes diminished significantly in size as well as in occurrence. My scalp still has flakes, but now they are normal sized ones that are present on every healthy scalp (skin sheds, remember) that aren&#x27;t unsightly and that get on everything. I have been reading something about rotating dandruff shampoos that use different active ingredients to help control a powerful scalp problem, so I may include either a different brand or a different line within the same brand to ensure I remain flake free for good. I always use the dandruff shampoo every time I wash my hair,  (which is every other day, unless I am doing something that requires an immediate wash, such as exercising) as recommended on the bottle. Thank you Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength shampoo, as you have solved my itchy dandruff issue!</li>
            <li> Best of Head and Shoulders products if you have oily dandruff prone scalp or active dandruff/seborrhea.</li>
            <li> This has a very bad smell that stays on your hair even after your hair is dry.  Cannot recommend.  It may very well work, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural hair (4b/c - somewhere between there).  I became natural in 2009, but after I had my baby in 2010 my hair/scalp went through a transformation and I developed scales and awful itching. After doing research I found I have seborrea dermatitis and I have tried numerous shampoos/conditioners to minimize or get rid of it.  Not to mention I was trying to stay with consuming natural products, but they did not work and believe it or not tea tree did nothing for me.  I also work out 6x a week so the sweat in my hair made the itching worse.  I bought this about 2 weeks ago (after watching someone on You Tube discuss dermatitis), used it twice (once a week) and I love it. I know this is cliche but this product has helped me go through my workouts and I hardly see any more scales (It&#x27;s not completely gone yet, but the itching has stopped). Since going natural, I&#x27;ve tried to stay away from laureth sulfate products, but if this product is stopping the itchiness and scaling, I guess me and laureth sulfates are friends and my natural hair doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with it.  The one thing I couldn&#x27;t stand was washing my hair with natural products that \\&quot;suppose\\&quot; to help and a couple hours later I&#x27;m back to scratching and seeing the flakes develop (and I wash my hair well). The scent of this product isn&#x27;t bad either. I highly recommend it. Thank you Head and Shoulders!     I am not a spokes person for this product nor paid for my review. I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter Khoret Amen Hair Smoothie for my deep conditioner (don&#x27;t care too much for the smell though, but it works).</li>
            <li> I had horrible dandruff and tried every treatment I could find...from $40 bottles of medicated shampoo to tea tree oil, nothing worked (in fact, most things actually made it worse!). After seeing this reviewed somewhere I decided to give it a try, even though other versions of Head and Shoulders did nothing for me. Within 2 weeks of daily use my scalp was completely cleared (I have to use it about once a week now to prevent a reoccurance). I highly recommend this shampoo to those who are looking for relief for stubborn dandruff.</li>
            <li> Because of chemo, I had severe flaking, soreness and itching on my scalp.  My oncologist recommended this shampoo and after the first time I used it, I felt the difference.  This and the conditioner are great for my problem, plus I love how it smells.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I refuse to use any other shampoo but head and shoulders. I have a bad dry scalp and head and shoulders keep it under control. &amp;#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions stated are 100% my own&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I suffer from Sebhorrheic Dermatitis of the scalp, and by far this is the best OTC product I have found. It is also gentler on my sensitive skin than any prescription strength shampoo or topical stuff I have used. I love it!</li>
            <li> I usually have to use this shampoo a few times a year (between 4-6), but I have used it on and off for a few years. During times where I am very stressed, my scalp decides to get irritated, itchy, dry and flaky. I have tried the regular strength Head &amp; Shoulders but after a few tries, my scalp just goes back to being irritated and disgusting (to say the least). I found the clinical strength works a lot better for me, and is as gentle as it says it is. After 2-3 washes, my scalp goes back to normal without it flaking or being irritated. I do leave it on a few minutes as stated and I see it works better than to just rinse it off immediately. I do suggest using a Head &amp; Shoulders conditioner as a back-up/precaution. I found it works best in keeping my scalp in check as well as keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Very smelly. Does the job ok but stinks like crap. Be wary when you buy this product. The stench is strong.</li>
            <li> People who have suffered from this likely remember the only prescription shampoo that worked reliably was Capitrol, which was taken off the market due to lack of demand. This is the first shampoo since that has completely eliminated the problem in less than two weeks. Hopefully, the couple of reviewers that believe it damaged their hair are isolated cases, but it is always a possibility with strong shampoos. I did notice the smell, but that goes along with the medicated products I think. When I cut back to a couple of times a week, that problem should be less. Also, I wonder if you were to condition your hair with something lightly scented, whether that might mask the smell?  In any event, after the experience with Capitrol disappearing, I am taking no chances and ordering a case of this product to keep in the closet.  Thank you, P&amp;G!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do when it comes to dandruff but I can&#x27;t stand the smell it leaves. I end up washing my hair with another shampoo afterwards to avoid the smell.</li>
            <li> Controls dry skin yet is mild enough for daily use. Lacks a strong (unpleasant) scent like some other medicated shampoos. It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found so far in this category.</li>
            <li> This is the best out there. I tried everything else, including prescription treatment. Nothing is as good as this. I used this shampoo exclusively for about a year, about 3x a week. It was great. But then I noticed that my hair was thinning and breaking off. There were patches on top where it finally was obvious I was missing hair. I did not use any hair products at all except H&amp;S, and that was only for shampoo and conditioning. I never used mouse, sprays, any of that stuff. I also went to my doctor and we did some test like for thyroid, etc., but there was nothing wrong.    The end of the story is the only thing I could identify causing my hair to break off near the scalp was this shampoo. I switched to an expensive salon-type shampoo about 6 months ago, and over that time I have seen all the short sticks of hair around my hairline start growing back. Its getting thicker again. I don&#x27;t feel like I am constantly trying to hide the thin patches showing my scalp anymore.     So take careful notice of your hair. I think it is probably just a matter of hair type not that the shampoo is inherently bad. If you use this shampoo, maybe ask your stylist if there are treatments you can use to protect the hair from getting brittle and breaking off. I won&#x27;t use it anymore though. I would rather have an itchy scalp than those balding patches.</li>
            <li> I should have known better.  Price was too good to be true.  Product leaves a sticky residue on my scalp and hands; on anything it touches really. And, you can&#x27;t get rid of the smell.  Like it or not the stink stays with you all day.  I threw the whole mess out.  Don&#x27;t be taken in by this too good to be true offer.  It stinks !</li>
            <li> burned my scalp, DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> My husband loves this, and we will be buying again. It was a great deal. Works wonders and the results last.</li>
            <li> great buy, will continue to order this product online</li>
            <li> Until now I cannot find any substitute to this product, it&#x27;s the only one that works for my hair, if I stop and use anything else the dandruff returns back, even my hair dresser recommended other brands that I tested but no way.</li>
            <li> Worked great for me! My scalp was ridiculously ichty which left white residue under my finger nails. I guess it&#x27;s just dandruff but nothing was helping so I decided to give this a try and it did the trick! It smells good too!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for about a month, it worked great for his dandruff. I gave it a 3 star because it has a horrible smell. I intially thought the smell came from my husbands job, he works with metal all day. But when he had a week off and showered several times while off and the smell was still there I realized if was the shampoo. I has a very strong chemical smell. I signed up for subscribe and save, but now will cancel it. I cannot handle the odor constantly in my bed.</li>
            <li> This shampoo absolutely sucks. I bought it and the first time I used it it did get rid of my dandruff but after about 4 -5 times of using it my hair started to fall out excessively and I started to feel a lot of soreness on my scalp. Now I have a bald spot on my head and it looks terrible. My hair is not growing back so I stopped using it. I would not reccoment it to anyone. I rather have dandruff than a bald spot. :( I hate head and shoulders. Never again and also when you stop using it your dandruff comes back and worse that before.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis when I was a young teenager. I have tried every prescription shampoo and medicine on the free market! Nothing works as good as this stuff. I even mix a little tea tree oil for an extra boost and a tea tree conditioner. But this stuff alone does the job. It makes the itchies go away and keeps me feeling clean. It&#x27;s designed to not be rough on your hair too. Great, affordable product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for many years now.  It is wonderful.  I have seborrheic dermatitis where I will get itchy scabs on my scalp for no reason and this stuff makes it go away every time.  If I use it once every three days or so, I never have any more issues.  Despite containing sulfur, it actually doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.  Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried many other products with different active ingredients and nothing worked until this.</li>
            <li> This product work well for me it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great! Here in ct they are 10$ each will keep buying here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent sufferer of tinea and also have fairly oily skin/hair. I used to have to use anti fungal creams after every shower to keep it at bay but not anymore. This keeps my hair super clean and sometimes if I feel tinea coming on I will use it as a body wash and it works great. I also love Nizoral but this is a great lower cost alternative.</li>
            <li> Ok.  I had tried three or four different shampoos designed specifically to prevent itchy scalp (which I will review or have separately reviewed on Amazon) and this was the only one that actually worked.  I just use this as my everyday shampoo and keep a bottle in my locker at the club for my after workout shampoos as well.  High recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works just wonderful...thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since i bought it and i&#x27;ve had no more flakes.  This is an amazing product.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It is the best for itchy scalp. I cannot find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my scalp for years, and this shampoo seems to be no different. It has a nice smell, and takes the itch away, but I am still flaking, even after over a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything special just smells ok.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I had a fungal infections on my head and tried evrything and even the Dr. didn&#x27;t give the right medicine. I decided to try it on my own. Wow one time use and it was gone. I now use it twice a week and I haven&#x27;t had any problem since. that has been a few months ago. Highly recommend it! Thank you, Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is basically selsum blue.  Very dissappointed in this product as I expected more from this brand.  It didn&#x27;t help my condition in any capacity.</li>
            <li> This could very well cause a divorce in our house.  This stuff smells so bad it makes me want to throw up when my husband uses it.  The smell actually drifts from the bathroom into the bedroom and wakes me up.  So disgusting.</li>
            <li> I have dandruff and occasional bouts of seborrheic dermatitis. That, coupled with oily scalp, makes controlling my condition difficult. A long time ago, when I first experienced the dermatitis, it had gotten so bad I developed a fungal infection on my scalp. I went to a doctor and he told me to use Nizoral to treat it. Back then, it was still OTC. Using the Nizoral along with Scalpacin for the intense itch, the fungal infection cleared in a few weeks. I then used the Nizoral every 1-2 weeks with using regular H&amp;S in between to prevent it from coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, as many know, Nizoral is now no longer OTC. Someone on here already said it&#x27;s considered prescription strength, and I can&#x27;t afford too many prescriptions. I decided to give the H&amp;S Clinical a try. To my surprise, it worked great! The first use almost completely cleared up the dermatitis and got rid of all the dandruff. It also helped control the oil on my scalp. The second use completely cleared my scalp. Now, I use regular H&amp;S and use the Clinical strength when needed. I don&#x27;t use it everyday or even every week because a) I don&#x27;t need to now and b) I read that it can cause hair loss in high doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t smell too great. It smells just like the Nizoral used to, actually. However, the smell doesn&#x27;t really give me a problem because the conditioner afterwards makes my hair smell nice again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking for a good dandruff treatment that is relatively inexpensive, I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Smells strong of chemicals and not much improvement for my scalp. I switched to tea tree products.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my husband who has been rotating various dandruff shampoos with different active ingredients. It&#x27;s difficult to find one with selenium sulfide (same as in Selsun Gold, which I can&#x27;t find anymore), so I&#x27;ve ordered two bottles through Amazon for him.  I decided to try it and found that it&#x27;s the best smelling Dandruff Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, and left my long hair nice and shiny. I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering these.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and my scalp is bad in the winter. This not only doesn&#x27;t burn, it seems to help heal. Hate the smell though. I use Aveda to cover it because it&#x27;s ick!</li>
            <li> The best nonprescription dandruff shampoo I ever used.  Does not leave your hair dry and frizzy but excellent for dandruff.</li>
            <li> For years I had problems with a really itchy scalp and plucking off skin that was the size on an eraser head, after using this product it has no happened again. Might smell a little off at time but IT WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely effective. I had used the regular H&amp;S for over 6 years but the dandruff never seemed to subside. When I recently went to a hairdresser, she told me to use this stronger shampoo instead. I was skeptical, but after reading all the positive reviews, I decided that I need to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dandruff that was so persistent for so many years disappeared literally overnight after the first time I used it. Product is very effective and works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the smell: I was a bit hesitant upon opening the bottle. I guess it depends on taste, but I thought the smell was very good.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this formula since it came out. Recently, I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. I bought alot of these in case they are discontinuing it!</li>
            <li> I was suffering from terrible seborrheic dermititis, wait first of all I did not know my condition till it started on my nose, ears and eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Stinky scalp from 2nd day of my hair wask and itchy flaky always.&lt;br /&gt;This was my hero worked from DAY 1. my hair never smelled bad again</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, good packaging, got what I expected. Obviously it&#x27;s a little more expensive than what you&#x27;d pay in the store, but it&#x27;s the price of convenience, I guess!</li>
            <li> I have scalp issues and this is the only shampoo that will work for me consistently.  It is great to be able to buy from Amazon and show up at my door step,</li>
            <li> Have tried many other shampoos in the past. This is the best shampoo I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li> It really helps!!!very good!</li>
            <li> I have sebhorreic dematitis, and this stuff is a god-send.  I use it on my head and face to great effect.  Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to get rid of my oily hair and flaky scalp, not to mention the pimples my scalp was prone to get, my Dermatologist recommended that I try this shampoo. Boy was I glad I did! Within a week all my dryness and scalp acne were gone. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 6 months now and my scalp is still blemish free! Apperently there is an ingredient in this shampoo that helps fight off the extra yeast your body is producing. Whether or not this is the case, I&#x27;m dang glad it works for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to fight a dandruff problem I started having after taking a course of antibiotics. Dandruff is generally caused an imbalance of fungi on the scalp. Specifically an overpopulation of the Malassezia genus of fungi. The active ingredient in this product, selenium sulfide, is effective at killing off the fungi. The product has enough of the active ingredient in it to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for about three weeks, using it about three times per week. I massaged it into my scalp for a minute, let it sit for at least six minutes, and then rinsed it off completely. For the whole three weeks, it was pretty effective at keeping dandruff levels down, by the day after I had showered, medium-sized flakes about the size of a rice grain would begin to reappear. The product was, however, extremely effective at reducing itching, so my comfort levels and the number of flakes forced down by scratching were good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, even on the first wash, I experienced heavy hairfall, but not enough to make me overly nervous. By the end of the first week, the hairfall was heavier than the first week, my hair was thinning in areas, and each hair was also fragile and thin. By week three, I had developed two small line of baldness on the sides of my head, similar to the very, very early stages of male pattern baldness (similar to Norwood-Hamilton level 2, but with a deeper, slender lines down either side). My family also commented that my hair looked thinner and certainly less healthy. At this point, I felt I&#x27;d given the product a fair trial and stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product, itself, is very thick, I&#x27;d almost call it gooey. It has a light metallic tan colour and a strong medicinal-metallic smell. I found it extremely difficult to work into my hair (which is rather thick and coarse), and hard to rinse out because of its texture. I still have a bit that globbed onto my shower-curtain and refuses to rinse clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading around abit, my experience with this product seems rare, but not completely unique. I&#x27;m guessing the hairfall was due to the selenium sulfide (selenium can cause hairloss in high doses) and the many sorts of sulphur-based detergents (which can be extremely drying, causing hair to snap near the root). If this is the case, then my hair should grow back in about 7 months because that&#x27;s roughly the time it takes for a follicle to begin a new growing cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve dandruff, you&#x27;d probably be better off trying something else. Even though my experience is rare, it&#x27;s not something you want to pay money to experience. I&#x27;ve gotten great results with [[ASIN:B001ETUD5I Nizoral Dandruff Shampoo]] at the 2% concentration, which is unfortunately prescription stuff in America. I use a [[ASIN:B0001I8ZT4 Marvy Shampoo Brush]] to make sure I can reach my scalp properly, and leave the shampoo on my head for at least five minutes (usually closer to 10 minutes). If you&#x27;ve dandruff, remember to wash often and wash the things you touch (bedspreads, clothes, etc.) often. I put a fresh towel on my pillow each night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
            <li> Very good product, and the price  too</li>
            <li> The first day I used this, it worked great! Dandruff and dry scalp was a lot better.  But, the second day I seemed to have some kind of irritation from it that gave me mild hives. I know, that&#x27;s strange since it&#x27;s actually for a skin issue. I was bummed actually, because I have been using Nizorail for some time which has been ok, but it no longer works the way it used to, and this was a far better deal as a 2 pack. It was also something I could use much more often than Nizorail (which recommended not using it for more than a few weeks at a time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work, and was sorry I had to pass.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and a scalp that gets itchy a day after washing.  I thought itchy scalp was just something I had to live with until I tried a shampoo from Pytho that actually controlled the itching.  Unfortunately that shampoo was discontinued.  From then on I had went on a search for a shampoo that can tackle my itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Garnier Dandraff shampoo, Neutrogena T-Gel, Jason scalp therapy, and even some African black shampoo.  None could control the itch in any reasonable degree.  Neutrogena seem to perform better, while Jason performed worse than regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally tried this one called \\&quot;Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength Anti Dandruff Shampoo\\&quot; and finally I&#x27;m back to having no itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, different shampoo works for different folks.  My only advice is to try the cheaper shampoo first before moving up to ones that cost 15 or 30 dollars a bottle.</li>
            <li> great product, great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it for months to no effect</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis, troubled with an itchy scalp, small red bumps, lots of dandruff, oily scalp and the scalp turning stinky after every couple of days. I have been using Nizral (2%) for over an year now but to no avail. Enter H&amp;S Clinical Strength - my scalp stays fresher longer, much less red bumps and I wash just twice weekly. Amazon has the best price out there, and when the product that &amp;#34;Ships &amp; Sold by Amazon&amp;#34; went out of stock, the product was only available from third party sellers on Amazon. The price was crazy (around $23 for 2 bottles). I have been checking regularly since the past few weeks and thankfully it is back as a product  &amp;#34;Ships &amp; Sold by Amazon&amp;#34;. With S&amp;S and a $1 coupon, I have ordered it for only $9.85. Going to buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a Hard &amp; Shoulder Shampoo this is the best deal.  I upgraded from the regular H&amp;S.  No regrets.</li>
            <li> does wonders on dandruff</li>
            <li> Been using Head and shoulder clinical strength shampoo and it&#x27;s helpful to remove flakes. 😄 Glad this product is available online</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff problems for years.  Seems to have gotten worse as I grew older.  I tried many products including many from Head &amp; Shoulders.  Found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  My Dandruff is gone.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry flaky scalp and have tried a ton of products to no avail.  I&#x27;ve even tried other Head and Shoulder product that haven&#x27;t worked at all, an left me very disappointed.  I found this though and it&#x27;s amazing for my super dry scalp.  This is the only thing that has ever worked for me.  I am so happy i finally found something that works.  If you have tried all other product and nothing has worked this might be the answer.  Give it a shot!!!</li>
            <li> If you have dandruff this shampoo is great. It works well and your hair feels soft after use. The smell is a little strong but not unpleasant. It helps with dandruff and that&#x27;s what you buy this shampoo for</li>
            <li> Only shampoo that&#x27;s helped my dandruff and itchy scalp. I&#x27;m not completely cured, but it&#x27;s still the best thing I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> love the tingle and fresh feeling on my scalp and hair. I dont have dandruff, initially bought for dog with sebohrrea but afraid to use it on him, apparently dogs shouldnt use human shampoo.  may try it on his seborrhea anyway, any thoughts?</li>
            <li> seems to work great.  have not used extensively, but I have used other head and shoulder products and like them.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel horrible... Will not try this again</li>
            <li> Very good, shampoo here. I had to upgrade from regular strength to this, and after the first use, I immediately noticed a vast improvement. Nice smell and feel, and for the price for 2 bottles, you cant beat. I will be buying again in the future. Thanks.</li>
            <li> As ordered and above expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find selenium sulfide shampoo that doesn&#x27;t smell like menthol, herbs, or a man&#x27;s product. This shampoo is also (usually) less expensive than those other products by volume, too. Win, win! People regularly compliment me on the scent of my hair, and I&#x27;m dandruff free.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo in my entire life who kills the dandruff and i have like 6 moths without dandruff for the first time!!!</li>
            <li> dandruff GONE! i used many shampoos. i was H&amp;S user before but my dandruff came back so i experimented with other shampoos again. fast forward today, i tried this variant of H&amp;S and now i&#x27;m dandruff free again!</li>
            <li> Totally met my expectation.</li>
            <li> very nice product to reduce dandruff. the smell goes well too.i like it!</li>
            <li> Love the product, using it for 20 years!</li>
            <li> Not as strong as imagined but not bad either. Expected this shampoo to be stronger for my Seborrheic Dermatitis. While its provided some relief, its not as effective as I&#x27;d have imagined or liked it to be. Still leaves an itchy scalp, albeit not as dry as before. I&#x27;d still recommend it as a secondary regular shampoo when you don&#x27;t need the hassle of a prescription. Just don&#x27;t expect any miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, Amazon once again delivers on shipping. Product arrived at the door in 2 days (Prime Yay!) and not a single drop had leaked. Very well packed and delivered on time for free. Can&#x27;t ask for much more at this price.</li>
            <li> Works great and has a very nice scent.  Itchyness goes away right away and rinses out nicely with no residue and lasts</li>
            <li> If regular dandruff shampoo or dry scalp shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to work for you try this.  It has a different medicine in it than the regular stuff. I only have to use it once or twice a week to keep everything good.  It really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Very good, I&#x27;ve tried many brands and varieties for years and for the first time I&#x27;ve found a product that works!</li>
            <li> If you have Seborrheic Dermatitis, you&#x27;re obviously here for a reason. You understand the struggle that many of us have. So let&#x27;s get to the point. Try it. It may work for you like it has for others. It may not. But like me, if you have SD, you&#x27;re willing to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shampoo for about a month now and it seems to help somewhat. About 50% of my scalp is affected (ranging from the front of the scalp to the back of the head) and this product seems to be less irritating than others. It does seem to dry out the scalp a bit so use whatever moisturizer you&#x27;ve found works for you (I&#x27;m still in the process of trying to find mine). The symptoms have not gone away, but it&#x27;s definitely more effective than all the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried (Head and Shoulders Dry Scalp Care Shampoo; Nizoral (ketoconazole); Dead Sea sea salt; Triamcinolone Acetonide; etc...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint I have is the smell. Wafts from the bottle smell OK (neither particularly bad or good), but 15 seconds after it hits the scalp, there is a noticeable pungent smell. Specifically, it smells like dirty creek water (just like the creeks I&#x27;ve been near in my backyard or on golf courses). Not only that, but the copper color of the shampoo resembles the dried runoff found on the sidewalk after a storm; reddish-brown with the same distinct smell. I feel self-conscious about the smell as it seems to linger for at least half an hour after rinsing, but have been told by others that they don&#x27;t smell a thing.</li>
            <li> Tried it tonight for the first time.  It smells nice at first and then about a second later you get the chemical burn in your nose and throat.  Can&#x27;t say whether it worked or not.  Going to have to rewash my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like tar like some do, it smells like you sprayed febreeze at your nose or sniffed those fake air fresheners that are &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to smell like linen or cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have any kind of chemical sensitivities I do not recommend buying. If they would take out the scent I think it would be fine, the regular head and shoulders smelled ok and didn&#x27;t knock you over with the scent.</li>
            <li> First, the good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is generally effective at controlling (or at least reducing the severity of) severe seborrheic dermatitis (seb derm).  With regular use, it reduces itching, scaling, redness and greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear silver jewelry -- rings, earrings, piercings, etc. -- do yourself a huge favor and remove them before you get into the shower.  I discovered that this shampoo turns my sterling silver jewelry BLACK.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  I&#x27;ve never had ANY other shampoo or skin care product do this.  My silver ring, after coming into contact with this shampoo, looked like it had been thrown into a fire.  I had to spend an hour polishing it to get it shiny again.  I contacted the manufacturer about this bizarre issue but their only suggestion was to remove my jewelry before using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has a smell that I personally do not find very appealing.  The best way I can describe it is that it reminds me of the medicated soap used in hospitals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That wouldn&#x27;t normally be a huge drawback, but the problem is that the scent will stay on your body for hours or even DAYS... and it is very, very strong.  Even if I re-wash my hair with a different shampoo, I can still smell the fragrance from the Head &amp; Shoulders.  It&#x27;s THAT strong.  It will also cling to your towels, clothing, bed pillows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this shampoo a few times a year when my other shampoos occasionally lose their effectiveness (one is zinc-based and the other is tar-based).  I always dread using it, but unfortunately there aren&#x27;t many other choices.</li>
            <li> Switched to this from Selsun Blue because Amazon had it as a Subscribe and Save item. It&#x27;s borderline okay, using the same active ingredient as Selsun Blue.  Head &amp; Shoulders uses way too much perfume in this product.  Unfortunately, instead of smelling like something pleasant, it has an \\&quot;I-use-budget-shampoo\\&quot; scent. The olfactory assault is a bit overwhelming -- especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working as advertized. The type of dandruff i have is not the flaking kind, it is more like an accumulation of dead cells stuck to the scalp.  Was prescribed Nizoral, worked OK, but expensive to get the 2% prescription strength version. The version offered on Amazon&#x27;s site is 1% Ketoconazole, prescription is 2%, (about $29) really not sure if that would make a substantial difference in how effective it is but decided to try the Head and Shoulders Clinical instead. I don&#x27;t remember where I had seen it but in a comparison test it seemed more effective than Selsun Blue. Don&#x27;t know what the test parameters were. Still this is so much cheaper didn&#x27;t feel like I had much to loose. Selsun Blue has a different active ingredient which may be better in your particular situation. If you want the 2% Ketoconazole/Nizoral version you can find it on EBay, comes from Thailand.&lt;br /&gt;Will update this review in a couple of months with further results.&lt;br /&gt;Found more than one article on the Internet suggesting the use of Baking Soda as a shampoo since it is supposed to remove accumulated gels, sprays, etc.. Tried it, works well, cleans right down to the scalp, do not scrub hard, gentle massage technique suggested. I use a little gel, no sprays, conditioners or other treatments.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is definitely Not the &#x27;No Tears&#x27; version, hard to wash and let it sit for 5 minutes in the shower. Going to try using a sink, lather rinse re-apply and wrap a towel around head for 5 minutes, then rinse. Keep your eyes closed.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I held off doing a review so I could make it helpful.  I bought this stuff a couple months ago.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff or do I?  I know I have dry skin sometimes.  I have been told I have a few other skin problems but I am not sure.  I used to get flaking on the scalp.  I get dried skin cracking where the nose meets the face.  I get this nasty dried skin in the curls of my ears.  sometimes my hair is dry, other times greasy.  I am a white male with short hair and while I wash my hair daily- if I don&#x27;t I will flake badly&lt;br /&gt;SO I bought this after reading the reviews.  I used it for 2 weeks.  I normally use another cheap shampoo to get the hair wet and ready for this to soak in. then I used the head and shoulders.. I get it on my scalp and soak for a  few minutes to let it work.  I put it on my face by my nose and in the curls of my ears.  AMAZING,,, no more gunk in the ears.. cracking on face cleared up by the nose.  About 2 weeks later I stopped using the product.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to regular head and shoulders.  after a week or two the cracked facial skin or flaking skin was back.  the ears were not producing that powdered dry skin but they were starting to.  The scalp was starting to feel odd. While no skin flaked off, it felt like the pores on my head were open or flaking or something.. I can&#x27;t see the top of my own head,, sorry!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shampoo again and felt better.  So it does seem to work.. I am not sure if it is killing off a fungus among us or what.  All I know is when I use it I can see a difference after about a week or so.  I do not agree that it stinks.  no shampoo smells great and if it does then it has a lot of perfume in it you don&#x27;t need.  This shampoo has a  scent to it which is to cover up the not so great smell I am sure it has from the chems used to stop the skin problems.. It is a nice smell and if it works that is all I care about.  Others said their head smelled for hours.. my scalp did not smell after I washed this stuff off.It burns my eyes LESS than other shampoos and usually not at all !!!  SO I will probably update this review.  I am not saying this is a miracle and solved everything but I believe it works.  The price is good and I like the results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your head smells after using this product you might need a new head.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would leave a review for dandruff shampoo, or any other shampoo for that matter, but this is worth it!  I&#x27;ve had horrible dandruff since I was a child. Dermatologist said I needed to always use a zinc shampoo.  None of them ever completely cured the problem but they helped enough I wouldn&#x27;t die of embarrassment when I wore a dark shirt. I decided to finally try this one, not thinking it would do any better than all the other brands I&#x27;ve used for 35 years.  BUT IT DID after only ONE USE!.  The persistent dry flakes always stuck to my scalp were GONE from the top of my head.  The really thick areas of my head on the back and sides still have build-up but my hair is so super thick, I know not enough of it is getting thru or left on long enough to get rid of those areas.  But they were reduced a lot!  I imagine after a little more time, those areas will clear up too.</li>
            <li> Bought this and have been using for about two weeks, it definitely is not improving over the standard hand and shoulders and I might even say it is making it worse.  I have two bottles of this and probably won&#x27;t even use the second one, going to give it a couple more weeks</li>
            <li> With the first use this shampoo decreased my dandruff and itchiness. I am very satisfy with this product and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> DISCOVERED WALMART BRAND 50% LESS BUT STILL HARD TO FIND SELENIUM PRODUCT</li>
            <li> product is great the amazon shipping took 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> As soon as I stop using this shampoo, my scalp starts feeling itchy....That&#x27;s why I always end up going back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time now and I have no complains about it.  The reason I am giving it only 3 stars  is because in my recent order, one of the bottles leaked and it stained and damaged some of the items I bought from amazon.  If the price of it didn&#x27;t increase (was $13.56/ 2 bottles when I last got them) to $26.95, I might still recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, highly recommended to control Seborrheic dermatitis. It smells very good, and it is not as strong as Nizoral or any other products used to control dandruff or SD. Results can be seen the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> It works. My itch is soothed.</li>
            <li> Bad dandruff and dry scalp made me scratch my head like crazy. It was snowing every time I touched my head. It would get to the point where my head would be sore from scratching it and I think I cut my head. When I bought this product my dandruff virtually goes away and it soothes your head from the itchiness. Just use it daily for awhile till you don&#x27;t think you need it as much and it will be gone in no time. I still use it every week.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo!  It makes his hair soft and smelling nice.  It leaves your hair clean without stripping the oils.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo for its purpose.  It definitely helps get rid of any flakes.  I use it in the winter as it gets dry here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not very pleasant.  I use conditioner after it and I can still smell it all day long.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my scalp greasy.</li>
            <li> I love it.  As a dude with somewhat long hair it, it really works.  I enjoy it and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and in great condition. While other items in the box exploded (Old Space Body Wash 3-Pack) these were perfectly fine and worked great!</li>
            <li> Works as it says it does. My dry scalp problem disappeared in about a week when using this daily.</li>
            <li> If you normally use head and shoulders youll notice it says not for everyday this one says everyday. I have had more consistent good results with this one</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for scalp psoriasis. I used tar shampoos for years with some success but this works better.</li>
            <li> My husband was using the regular Head &amp; Shoulders and it wasn&#x27;t cutting it. He moved up to this Clinical Strength version and he has no complaints. My only complaint is that there isn&#x27;t a 2-in-1 Clinical Strength version of Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Worked great and he loved it</li>
            <li> I used the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method for well over two years to clean my hair. I loved how natural it was, and how it helped my hair with not needing a wash every single day. Unfortunately, my scalp retaliated and I kept trying to use different natural methods to clear up the horrible dandruff. But no matter what I did, my scalp was itchy, scaly, and unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after all that time, I picked this up. I LOVE IT! I still only wash my hair every 5 or 6 days, but it doesn&#x27;t get itchy and I no longer have any dandruff. It took about three or four washes for me to see about 80% clearance of the dandruff. But after the first wash, it was about 50% clear. A huge difference! It also kept my hair cleaner for longer.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is fairly drying, but I rinse it well, use a good conditioner, and only wash every 5 or 6 days. I love this stuff and will recommend it to anyone I know with dandruff.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried just about every shampoo around, (regular H&amp;S, Neutrogena T-Gel, Selsun Blue, just to name a few) and this seems to be the only one that tames my poor husband&#x27;s dry scalp.  Slightly oily hair, but flaky scalp... go figure.  This one WORKS!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair a bit stripped, but works excellent as a body wash to keep Tinea from breaking out after heat and sweating.</li>
            <li> I had flakes on my head and an itchy scalp for over a year and I tried all sorts of other products and nothing worked. I was getting ready to go to a doctor and maybe try some sort of prescription when I found this. After 1 wash no itch and no flakes. The best part is, it doesn&#x27;t smell atrocious like most of the other anti-dandruff shampoos do, it is more or less odorless. The fact I could add this to my subscribe and save was amazing.</li>
            <li> This type of dandruff shampoo works great for me. The Zinc stuff wasn&#x27;t working. I got some prescription sulfide stuff (same as this) and that worked well but it was very expensive. This head and shoulders is a fraction of the price and works just as good imo.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this product for his itchy scalp and swears by it, all the sulphate free shampoo&#x27;s don&#x27;t work on his hair...a little goes a long way...with this product, and he has tried a lot of dandruff shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I use Defense soap and this shampoo.  It&#x27;s the only things that work for me.</li>
            <li> i really like this shampoo very much! it helps with my dry scalp and my itching a 100%!!! i definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I tried for years to find shampoo that I could use that didn&#x27;t cause me to have horrible dandruff. We&#x27;re talking &amp;#34;looks like snow on my shoulders&amp;#34; level of bad. Low and behold though, within 2 weeks of using this product it was gone. Haven&#x27;t had a problem in several years. I can actually wear black shirts, and it is all thanks to the selenium sulfide in this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works, period. I tried tons of zinc based products before this, and they ranged from doing nothing to making things MUCH worse.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. Cleans well. Smells nice. Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> Controls my dandruff quite well, and smells better than the other blue brand you might know. Note that there are two main types of dandruff shampoo: selenium sulfide (like this), and pyrithione zinc (white bottle). If one doesn&#x27;t work for you, try the other. I prefer the selenium sulfide ingredient, but others think pyrithione zinc works better for them.</li>
            <li> I have just found out i have Seboric Dermatitous. I used this and it helped remove some of the crustys i got and reduce the problem but I cant handle the smell. Its just smells bad but not right out of the bottle only after being on the scalp. Kind of a sulphery after smell that haunts me off and on during the day and makes me feel like I have B.O especially when first stepping out into the sun.  Perhaps oddly to some but I prefer the smell of the Nutragena T-gel extra strengh with the coal tar even though that is strong to. The hair looked more healthy with the TGel to after hair dryed.</li>
            <li> I have serious itching and flaking from Seb. Derm. and dandruff.  I tried all the usual suspects including cold tar shampoos to no avail.  The first time I used this shampoo, I noticed a big reduction in itching and have been using it ever since.  It&#x27;s not a cure but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for my problem.</li>
            <li> That my first product I tried  and it did help. Thank you for this shampoo . It doesn&#x27;t cost a lot so try it before u use all this expensive product out there.</li>
            <li> Having dandruff is a treat compared to using this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been dealing with dandruff on and off most of my life. After a few clean months, I noticed I was getting it again, and decided to try this shampoo. First off, it smells horrible, why it has to smell like crap is beyond me. Then things quickly go from bad to worse. I couldn&#x27;t even rinse this crap out of my hair, it felt like I had spiking pomade stuck in my hair. After an extra 10 minutes trying to wash it out, I decided to just towel off. Great now my RL towel is COVERED in yellow stains from drying my hair. This was after spending 10+ minutes trying to rinse the shampoo out. There was still enough shampoo stuck in my hair to stain my towel yellow. Seriously? I&#x27;m just glad I noticed and kept scrubbing my hair with the towel before I ruined my $200 sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the dandruff, I don&#x27;t know. I promptly tossed this bottle of garbage into the waste bin. I learned a lesson about reading reviews before buying, even from big brands, I just hope I don&#x27;t get bald spots like some of the other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would literally rather get an STD than use this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> looking for the old formula...works as expecgted</li>
            <li> Works better than any dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  Love the rich texture - leaves hair very soft.  Use nothing else now.</li>
            <li> Stopped my head from itching. Good shampoo! I only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> Too harsh on the hair though it fights dandruff.</li>
            <li> I am giving a middling review, because I am not sure what it has done, but detracting two stars for its capacity to turn my very white grey hair blond. When I have used, I must wash hair again with other to remove coloring.</li>
            <li> I am bald so I actually got this to use on dry skin that I have on the sides of my nose and forehead.  I have been dealing with this for 30+ years, the skin would get so dry it would flake and peal leaving my face with embarrassing  red patches on my face. I just rub on a small amount as I get in shower and rinse off when done. I now use it about 3 times a week and It has completely gone away. Saved hundreds of dollars over perscription meds that basically have the same ingredients. Works on most dry patchy skin problems.</li>
            <li> I think it helps for the reason I got it, but I tend to smell it throughout the day. I only use it once or twice per week, and always try to wash with regular shampoo after, but the smell lingers. Not that bad, but not something I like to smell all day. Does help with the odd bumps and itching scalp that happens especially in warmer, humid months of the year.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this stuff works as well as it does.  I pored over the reviews before purchase, and was a bit skeptical, but for the $13 or so that I paid, I figured what the heck.  I have tried literally everything to control my seborrheic dermatitis, from OTC remedies such as Ketoconazole, Selenium Sulfide and Pyrithione Zinc to $350 Clobetasol shampoo, and a whole host of cheaper Rx goops and ointments.  I even tried crazy home remedies like olive oil scalp soaks, etc.  Don&#x27;t believe people that tell you this stuff reeks or stains towels, clothing, sheets; none of this is true.  Rinse it out of your hair like anything else.  No rocket science, no tricks.  It smells like regular OTC Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo, which is to say, pleasant but not overly sweet or herbal.  It&#x27;s not very medicinal at all.  The way other reviewers carried on, I was prepared for it to smell like hell!  For those with experience, coal tar shampoo smells absolutely terrible, this stuff smells like spring meadows compared to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one use, no kidding, my seb derm was almost under control--itching gone, redness almost gone, very few flakes remaining.  After three uses, I was (and remain) fully symptom-free.  My scalp. Does not. Itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been to over 4 dermatologists in 2 years (PPO and HMO).  For all the hundreds I&#x27;ve spent, it&#x27;s an amazing relief to have this stuff work so damn well.  You owe it to yourself to try this if you&#x27;re suffering with seb derm.  Fwiw, regular Selsun Blue (which features the same active ingredient at perhaps a lower strength by default) didn&#x27;t do the trick, but this stuff did.  Whatever the case, this 1% selenium sulfide concoction is amazing.  According to my dermatologist, the way to keep seb derm under control is to rotate, so use this and others throughout the week to \\&quot;confuse\\&quot; your scalp into behaving, while not allowing it to adapt to one consistent method of treatment.  Either way, this stuff is worth its weight in gold.  No more flakes, no more itching, no more redness AT ALL.  Protip: if you have seb derm on the face or sideburns, a little of the lather from this will get rid of it as well.  I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice &#x3D;].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I have been using this for two months and have not lost any hair or incurred temporary baldness due to this product, nor has it otherwise ruined my life or pursuit of happiness.  There&#x27;s quite an array of interesting reviews for this shampoo.No more flakes, no more itching, no more redness AT ALL.

            <li> Used this product once or twice a week for about a month.  It does control dandruff but not significantly more than regular dandruff shampoo.  It&#x27;s definately not worth the damage it has done to my hair.  Breakage, frizz, it&#x27;s even falling out!  I called the phone number on the back of the bottle...the Head and Shoulders rep said &#x27;Sorry, the product is too strong for your hair&#x27;.  Since there&#x27;s no warning on the bottle, I&#x27;m sharing that info here.....the product may be too strong for your hair.</li>
            <li> I used to be followed by a dandruff blizzard. Honestly, an absolute nightmare. I tried other brands, I tried other H&amp;S products, but my scalp still itched relentlessly and I was constantly having to dust myself off. About a year ago, I tried out H&amp;S Clinical Strength as a last defense (and I mean last - I&#x27;d given my friend&#x27;s medicated shampoos a try, I&#x27;d gone for the \\&quot;natural herbal approach\\&quot;, etc) before seeing a doctor, and I was amazed - it worked!&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff wasn&#x27;t all that was at stake though, as my hair was naturally very soft, strong, and healthy. I use this product regularly and have no complaints on those fronts, it has not damaged my hair in the slightest. As an added benefit, this shampoo is relatively concentrated and works in very well, so you can use less with each washing and stretch your dollar even farther! H&amp;S Clinical Strength really helped me, and I give it my wholehearted recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;(Also, I don&#x27;t notice any particularly bad smell - I&#x27;m not picky about how my shampoo&#x27;s scented, but I can verify that this is neither bad nor strong.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference; 21 y/o caucasian male with dark, natural hair. Suffered from dry scalp, itching, dandruff, but no more!</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo. Does not make your hair fall. Good for dandruff. I&#x27;ve actually never tried any other product that&#x27;s meant to compete with this one.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years and couldn&#x27;t find it from Walmart, so bought it from Amazon.  It solves my sensitive hair better than other products.</li>
            <li> Nothing works quite like it. It has a very clean smell to it, I get complements on its smell constantly. It also make your hair feel incredible!!</li>
            <li> This is very good shampoo. It is likely I will buy it again. It soaps better and leaves my hair less fly away than the normal Head and Shoulders shampoo.</li>
            <li> This Fall I had a bad case of dandruff. After one use, the dandruff reduced almost completely! After a week of usage, my dandruff vanished! This stuff really works! If I used Head &amp; Shoulders other versions, I will continue to have dandruff, but this version is the best. I highly recommend this product and a great conditioner!  Order yours today!</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I came in here and wrote a quick review for this product before I forgot again. Dandruff is embarrassing, but a fact of life. It happens, and unless you just want to live with it you need to find some way to quickly and with as little fuss, get rid of it. I&#x27;ve had chronic dandruff for several years now. I&#x27;d made cursory efforts here and there to deal with it, including using other shampoos of this type, including other versions of this very brand. Nothing really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just recently decided to try the Clinical Strength Head &amp; Shoulders, and as I said I&#x27;ve tried the less potent stuff before to no avail. I am happy to report that with this product I noticed an almost immediate difference, and somewhere between the first full week and second week of me using it, it completely cleared up my dandruff. Now I&#x27;m down to using it perhaps 3 or 4 times per week, while using my regular shampoo every other day, and I&#x27;ve remained dandruff free. I will say it has that distinctive Head &amp; Shoulders scent, not really bad or good, but you&#x27;re not going to smell like lilacs unless you use scented conditioner or something. The bottom line here is that it worked wonders for me, so if you have your standard chronic dandruff issues then it will probably work for you as well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does a better job on dandruff than any other over-the-counter shampoo. This is a must-have for oily hair types, but it isn&#x27;t overly drying for those with normal or dry hair. The smell is classic Head &amp; Shoulders - very clean, but not medicinal. You can&#x27;t beat this price, either!</li>
            <li> Good Dandruff Shampoo and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I alternate this clinical strength with Selenium in it with regular Head and Shoulders every other day... the two together help control my scalp problem better than anything I have tried before</li>
            <li> The only shampoo that consistently meets my needs.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It makes my day!!!!</li>
            <li> Working in a very dry climate daily, on top of gym workouts is brutal on a scalp. The bottles came fast and ironically right before I was going to take a shower after a workout.  Ooooooooooh so good.the directions says use twice a week or more. I still used with my conditioner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews about it changing hair color make sure you thoroughly rise your hair out afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have tried other solutions, but this is the only thing that I have found that consistently gets rid of flakes. I would recommend this product to anyone who has had trouble with annoying dandruff.</li>
            <li> it works really good but lose hairs that&#x27;s it. i used it once a week or once in a 8 to 10 days. that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> new and great no more flakes</li>
            <li> It smells unpleasant and the smell lingers in your hair for days. But it does prevent dandruff quickly and efficiently if you can get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling severe dandruff for a few months now and after 2 weeks of using this product I&#x27;m 99% dandruff free!! I&#x27;m sure it will clear completely up in another week or so and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything out there with no results until I purchased this. I would highly recommend it to anyone suffering from dandruff.</li>
            <li> I was having a terrible problem with dandruff I changed hair grease, conditioner, but nothing helped until I started using this shampoo it did take a few washes but it did work</li>
            <li> Bad the shampoo arrived broken, I need my money back,was not well packaged I get my box in Miami all broken and watered</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong it works. I dont think it is more effective than regular head and shoulders. The only reason why I am giving this such a low review is that this shampoo will give every part of your body it touches a very very weird and distinct odor. It is very hard to describe, the closet description i can think of is a bunch of medication for elderly people. You know that scent of medication at nursing homes. Yup that is what is smells like a bit. Or sniff a bottle of GNC vitamins. that&#x27;s what i smells like too. At first I though I was being self conscious. The first time I used it, it was very subtle however it gets more and more noticeable as you use it. My advice, justs stick with regular head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> The product is good for special hair care, but I would not suggest to use the product daily since its strong effect.</li>
            <li> Head and shoulders is a really good brand when talking about hair products, and this is not the exception, I have serious problems on my skin so i do not only use it on my head but on my face as well and it really works.</li>
            <li> Very good smelling Head and Shoulders Shampoo. Works well on an itchy scalp too! Recommend it!</li>
            <li> The effect is so amazing! Used this shampoo and almost removed all the visible dandruff. Compared to other products, I fell highly satisfied with this product. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength Dandruff Shampoo  14.2 Fl Oz is an excellent product and really gets my hair CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;It is good for the scalp, too.  I&#x27;m ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Clinical strength lives up to it&#x27;s name.  This shampoo left my hair more flake and itch free than regular Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I used this months ago and my hair started breaking off.  I still have flakes and they are AWFUL.  Used it again last week and my re-growth of hair broke off again.  NOT HAPPY.  So I am not sure if it does work on dandruff, wish I could find out.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells terrible. Simple as that.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done without stripping moisture from my hair and it works even on my color treated hair. Rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t smell offensive. I grabbed with it was a 2 -fer deal and will order again. I leaves my hair feeling clean and gets all the product out. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> If you have dandruff, this is a great shampoo. Just use it on and off regularly and you&#x27;ll notice the effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few products and I have to say that this works well.  Its cleared up probably 90% of my embarrassing flakes.  I tend to wear darker colors like grays and navy blues, so this had made my life a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some complaints about the smell, but I don&#x27;t think its that bad.  It is certainly much better than the tar-based products.  I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> WIth dandruff, this is def a must have.  Works great.</li>
            <li> My daughter was suffering a lot with the dryness of the scalp and using this shampoo solved the problem. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Bought this with great savings on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this shampoo. Normal Head and Shoulders smells really clean and fresh in the shower and then, once out of the shower, you don&#x27;t smell it at all. The smell of this stuff lingers for hours. I shouldn&#x27;t be able to smell my own hair once my shower is done. It&#x27;s not like I have long hair that wraps around my nose. It may very well work wonders with dandruff, but the smell is simply too much to get past. It&#x27;s not a medicinal smell and I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s completely unnecessary to the formula. It&#x27;s a very heavily perfumed smell. The odor itself might be pleasant enough if it simply weren&#x27;t so STRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope P&amp;G addresses this awful, awful smell.</li>
            <li> Usually buy these in store, but there was a great deal on here with a $3 off coupon.  I love this shampoo.  It is the ONLY shampoo that combats the dandruff we get from hard water.  Love it!</li>
            <li> the price for this item is better for me to buy every 2 mouth.&lt;br /&gt;and it work&#x27;s good on my hair.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is selenium sulfide: it works like Selsun Blue, smells like Selsun Blue, but it seems a bit cheaper considering the volume (?). I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a property inherent in selenium sulfide that makes all shampoos of this class smell so clinical. It may also be part of the marketing image of &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34;. What this does is control dandruff and other related ailments, in my opinion, maybe a little better than the typical pyrithione zinc shampoo, but it comes with it harshness that damage my hair and makes it fall out a bit -- in other words, probably good for occasional use, not daily. If bread and butter Head &amp; Shoulders doesn&#x27;t quite do the trick for you, you might want to try this, but it doesn&#x27;t work significantly better to justify its potential drawbacks in my experience. Your miles may vary.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo is the ONLY shampoo that stops my head from itching! I LOVE this brand so much! Whenever my head itches, I use this shampoo and it instantly stops. It also keeps any dandruff away!! This is a MUST buy and the price on amazon is way better than the store prices!! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Always liked H&amp;S.Doctor said use</li>
            <li> Mu dermatologist recommended the Clinical version of Head and Shoulders. She also told me to wash my face, eyebrows etc in this shampoo in case dandruff was irritating my Blepharitis</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last few years and have sworn by it.</li>
            <li> This removed scalp smell.&lt;br /&gt;But, it makes my hair so frizzy..&lt;br /&gt;So, there is trade off between frizzy hair and removed scalp smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb!  I used to get flaky patches in the winter that I didn&#x27;t think was dandruff but this the Clinical Strength Head and Shoulders has totally taken care of it - without an awful smell.  I started out using it almost every day and have cut back now to just once or twice a week using my regular shampoo in between.  It lathers up nice and cleans your hair well but most importantly - no flaky white stuff on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> But be aware your head is going to have a weird chemical-medicine smell for a day or so after, no matter how much you rinse. It had this peculiar odor that smelled like something that should give you super powers.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is definitely worth it! It is less than half the price and the bottle is MUCH bigger. When using it, you should always wash your scalp under the shower head. It&#x27;s important to rinse well when using any dandruff shampoo. This shampoo smell very clean. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting dandruff as long as I can remember &amp; I am 79 years young. A couple of years ago I noticed this product in the drug store &amp; picked it up to try. I only used the shampoo twice (the first week)&amp; the dandruff was GONE. I really had trouble believing it. I recently found it in Amazon &amp; since then - that is where I purchase it. I have tried MANY dandruff shampoos, but this is the BEST.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does wonders for my dandruff, but I only use it about once every week or two weeks because it makes everything my hair touches smell awful. I have tried rinsing my hair our for 2-3 minutes after shampooing, but my towels still smell awful. Typically my towels won&#x27;t smell until they are wet, but once they get any moisture on them, they start to smell like sulfur (I presume from the selenium sulfide?).</li>
            <li> I bought the non clinical strength stuff and it didn&#x27;t quite do the trick - but this does! It doesn&#x27;t smell great, so I use a good smelling conditioner after, but it&#x27;s very effective all winter long.</li>
            <li> Bought this thinking it would cure my dandruff, well after using these there bottles my dandruff only got worse.  Turned out that my hair need conditioning.. My Dermatologist told me to start using a conditioning shampoo that moisturized.  Now no dandruff at all.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit harsh, but it works on my scalp when other products wont. I have used this for years.</li>
            <li> I always used the Clinical Strength Head and Shoulders when I was in high school and my hair was always flake-free. For some reason, I started using regular Head and Shoulders for a few years and my hair was fine. Then, a few months ago, I started getting really awful flakes again. Tried all different kinds of shampoos (pyrithione zinc, coal tar, salicylic acid) and they would work for a few days and my flakes would come back with a vengeance. I would wash my hair daily, I&#x27;d wash it every other day, I would skip conditioner, I would use extra conditioner. Always had the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was searching on Amazon for SD treatments and came across this shampoo. I remembered using it and figured it was worth a try. Yes, it does have a metallic-chemical smell. Yes, it sticks around after you rinse and condition. But I don&#x27;t think the smell is bad at all (actually brings back some memories of practicing choir music before school). And, I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day to stay flake-free. I can usually go 2-3 days without shampooing and I&#x27;m fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone with Seborrheic Dermatitis. It&#x27;s not terribly expensive and anyone commenting on the smell is just being a jerk. It&#x27;s really not that bad at all. And you can use a nicer smelling shampoo on the days you don&#x27;t decide to use this kind.</li>
            <li> Best head and shoulders that you can buy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores, only damn thing that seems to work.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by it and it is the only thing that works 100% for him. It cost more (would LOVE to see the price come down) But worth the money because he has absolutely no dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have a really, really bad oily hair with horrible dandrunff. I tried this shampoo a couple of year ago and voiá... it did the trick. Not only my dandruff is gone, but my hair doesnt have that horrible greasy-sticky look.</li>
            <li> I started getting some rough dandruff on my hairline.  This got rid of it after one use!!  I&#x27;ll always keep a bottle of this on the side just in case I need it.  I don&#x27;t wanna use it too often with the sodium laureth sulfate.  I use shampoos that aren&#x27;t as harsh, until I get dandruff.  Then I use Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> This shampoo might work for other people with great results, but unfortunately not for me. O was really hopeful that this would help me for my really bad dandruff, but if anything is just made it worse :/ giving it three stars because I know that other people may benefit from this</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shampoos! I don&#x27;t have dandruff but I do have extremely greasy hair and an itchy scalp so I use this 2 times a week to deep clean and sooth my scalp. It doesn&#x27;t have a disagreeable scent and the smell isn&#x27;t very strong either. If you get little pimples along your hairline I would also recommend using this shampoo for that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product for dandruff. In fact, I have quite the opposite problem. I have extremely oily hair and have had it for a very long time. My dermatologist recommended this shampoo because my hair did not feel clean after using other products. I used to wash my hair in the shower with the old shampoo and have to put powder in my hair when I got out of the shower because my hair was still oily. Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength is the only shampoo that was able to keep my hair from getting oily. When you first use it in the shower, your hair will feel very very dry. It&#x27;s a weird sensation because it feels almost like your hair is dry, yet it is in a running shower. To fix this, I always use conditioner on the bottom half of my hair (and especially the ends but never the scalp because of how oily my hair is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen many reviews on here that people complain of the smell. To me, it does not smell like a chemical at all and I actually like the smell of this shampoo. I also have not experienced any notable hair loss from this shampoo. I have been using this product for 5-6 years every single day and I swear by it. If you have extremely oily hair, I do not know of a better product that this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*P.S. The only downfall of this product is that you cannot keep hair dye in your hair. This shampoo will take the color right out. However, if your goal is to get rid of a bad hair-dyed color, this is the product for you! I dyed my hair once and by the end of the week all of the color was gone and back to my natural hair color. This is a small price to pay for the wonderful way this shampoo keeps my hair clean!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  I this it is helping my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Seborrheic dermatitis can result from one or more of several factors. This means that there is no one solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this variety of Head &amp; Shoulders every day for two weeks and my SD got much worse. When I stopped using it, my entire scalp was covered with scales of dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched back to standard Head &amp; Shoulders and the scaliness went away on the second washing. As did the unbelievable itching this product produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, yes, the product leaves a lingering chemical smell in your scalp, no matter how thoroughly you rinse. Regular H&amp;S does not leave this smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth trying this version of H&amp;S to see if it helps you. But it&#x27;s not a magical cure for everyone.</li>
            <li> It stops my dandruff which was never cleaned by other products. A great product to try if you do not have other options.</li>
            <li> Works great. At this strength it was hard to find in local pharmacy chain. Price was right smells great and is very effective for itchy scalp which I purchased for.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this shampoo is hands down the best thing I have tried to get rid of my dry scalp. It works, and it works well. The only complaint I have about this product is that the cap on the top is not always easy to open, especially when it is wet. Since the bottle is only used when it is wet, it can be annoying.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had issues with dandruff for ages. Finally, I went to the dermatologist and went on a prescription shampoo. Like magic, after about 2 months I was dandruff free. When I went back, I reported the good news, and he told me to taper off the prescription (which was very strong) onto this specific shampoo. And, to his credit, I&#x27;ve remained dandruff free for almost 2 years on the combination of Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength for my daily wash, and the prescription once or twice a month. After a decade of itching, scratching, and embarrassment, I&#x27;m dandruff free!</li>
            <li> Good but smell like medicine.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to a new city with extremely poor water quality and within a few months my scalp was always itching and flaking.  I tried less shampoo, more shampoo, conditioner, even cutting off my bleaching routine on my hair (my poor now-brown hair is crying over that decision still).  Nothing worked and I was positive I had a scalp problem I would never get rid of until I moved away from this town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out all I needed was Head &amp; Shoulders.  I&#x27;ve never tried any H&amp;S product in my life before a few weeks ago, but I bravely purchased this bottle in the hopes it would cure me.  After one use I felt so much better, and after a few weeks I only scratch my head maybe twice a day.  Before it was a constant itch.  Note:  I use this shampoo as directed, every other day when I shower (office jobs - saving water since whenever office jobs were invented), and then I condition with Tresemme Conditioner Luxurious Moisture once a week because the water and bleaching also dried out the rest of my hair.  This combo has done wonders for me, and this shampoo has almost cured my dandruff and I&#x27;m sure will continue to keep it away for the foreseeable future.  Thanks, Head &amp; Shoulders!</li>
            <li> My husband has used regular Head &amp; Shoulders for years. When I saw the Clinical Strength version I thought I&#x27;d buy it. It smells good in the bottle but after my husband shampooed with it his hair smelled AWFUL! It smelled like sulfur, or in other words, rotten eggs!. My son used it too and said it made him stink so bad he showered again with another product  just to be able to stand himself! I called Proctor and Gamble and reported this and they sent me a coupon for $8.00 off a bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders. I&#x27;m not sure I could find a bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders that cost $8.00 but it was a nice gesture.</li>
            <li> So. I&#x27;ve had dandruff all my life. I&#x27;ve always used head and shoulders. I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of shampoos, and so I can&#x27;t use off brand dandruff shampoos. I ended up buying this off Amazon after I saw it, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. BEST DECISION EVER. Listen to the instructions. Lather it into your hair, massage it into your scalp and let it sit for a few minutes. Then wash it out. After the first use, I didn&#x27;t use dandruff shampoo for a few days, and nothing. No flakes. No itchy head. I used it on and off for a few months and I have had no sign of an itchy scalp or dandruff flakes. This is honestly a life saver. I have very dark hair, so those flakes are horrible and it&#x27;s not extemely expensive. You can get this for less than 7 a bottle, and you DON&#x27;T have to use it every hair wash. Just use it a few times a week and it&#x27;s gone. LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> If Selsun blue smell is too strong for you, try this; it works very well.</li>
            <li> Worked very well. In fact, noticed difference after first use. I have come to realize that there are different types of dandruff so no one shampoo will do it all. This one works well. Noticed difference after first use</li>
            <li> This shampoo really deep cleans, stops dandruff and leaves a silky shine to my hair.  The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping me with extensive flaking.  Using it at the advice of my dermatologist.  It even travels with me.  Remember to leave it on for 5 minutes!  I do finish up with my shampoo for gray hair.</li>
            <li> My husband and son suffer from Seborrheic Dermatitis and we have been using everything under the sun to help with the flakes, and red patchy skin, we even used regular Head and Shoulders. I had no clue Head and Shoulders made a Clinical Strength Shampoo for Seborrheic Dermatitis and once I saw it was a 2 pack for an AWESOME price I jumped on it!&lt;br /&gt;My husband and son have been using it for about 2 weeks now and it seems to really be helping! my husbands scalp isnt as red where it usually breaks out anymore and dandruff is practically gone.&lt;br /&gt;This product works great and even smells good! One product (T-Gel ) that is supposed to help with Seborrheic Dermatitis makes your head smell like charcoal, not this product, it leaves my husband and sons hair smelling awesome, did i mention it made their hair super soft too? Its a great product that truely helps!</li>
            <li> My scalp started to become very itchy and dandruffy and I had no idea why until I did some research on the internet which led me to this product. After using it for over a month my scalp is no longer itchy and I don&#x27;t have dandruff. Very pleased and will buy again</li>
            <li> Selsun is typically the &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; selenium sulfide shampoo utilized for seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff, but this is pretty comparable. I liked the price on this product and it work great if you allow it to soak into your scalp for 20 minutes before your shower. I only use it about 2-3 times a week. The smell could be better, but your will eventually get used to it.</li>
            <li> product gets all the dandruff flakes and eczema effected skin off the scalp. hair is cleaned very well.</li>
            <li> The men in my house use this and it truly does take away the white flakes and dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING at the drugstore (including every single H&amp;S product) to solve my dandruff/scalp build up problems and it isn&#x27;t until I&#x27;ve found this product that I have seen a significant result. Actually, that&#x27;s an understatement considering it has completely solved my scalp problems. I use this every time I wash my hair (pretty much every other day) and I can&#x27;t say enough about how pleased I am with it. I did, however, decided to change my conditioner to something a bit more hydrating and strengthening  because I started to feel my hair go a little bit dryer. It is worth mentioning that I do use this product along with Neutrogena&#x27;s T Sal for scalp build up. This is one of those shampoos I tried before finding the H&amp;S Clinical Strength and never really stopped using. It was helping with the problem but it wasn&#x27;t quick enough for me so that&#x27;s why attribute 80&amp; of my current scalp situation to this H&amp;S product and I super highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have tried couple products deal with dandruff. This is the one works well,  much better than those with Zinc</li>
            <li> is an amazing very good shampoo leaves very clean and healthy scalp</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo - it really works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and really like it.</li>
            <li> before this product I had pretty bad dandruff problems. I washed my hair daily, and I still had lots of dandruffs (some of them are rather large with tiny red spots in the middle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a couple products, none worked as well as this.</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto, de buen aroma, alta calidad, controla eficazmente la caspa. En tan solo 2 días a mi padre le ha eliminado el problema.</li>
            <li> Head and Sholders Clinical Strength realy works to eleminate my danderuff, however it caused a severe case of acknee on my forehead. Washing with soap and water controlled this acknee.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple dandruff shampoos through the years and this is the only one that consistently works for me. The active ingredient is 1% selenium sulfide. If your shampoo isn&#x27;t working to combat your dandruff, look at the bottle to see what the active ingredient is. If it&#x27;s not selenium sulfide, you should try this shampoo. Also, unlike some other anti-dandruff shampoos, this one does not have a harsh chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I took one star off because i wish they would seal it so i know it hasnt been opened, I&#x27;m always afraid someone will mix nair into it, so i test it on a small area first. other than that works great.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and actually does what it says. This got my dandruff under control after just 2 uses and I&#x27;ll switch to another shampoo product for a month to see if this cured my problem or simply controls it. The smell, as noted by other reviewers, is overpowering and I&#x27;d advice to give your hair a really good rinsing after you shampoo it to get rid of the smell. The smell is really powerful, especially in summer, and has a sulfuric odor to it. All in all I&#x27;d gladly deal with the smell, which can be mask with a little oil and good rinsing, for the awesome results.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works to get that dandruff out of my hair. I tried other shampoo&#x27;s this oe does the job.</li>
            <li> was having dandruff and mild acne issues on neck...cleared both up . Recommended</li>
            <li> The only shampoo that works with tough dandruff. Been trying many brands, only this one works!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. Leaves hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty I am free at last!</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!</li>
            <li> Been using it for years.  Works</li>
            <li> Dandruff cleared up after one wash and I had it bad. Going to use once every two weeks. It made my hair soft and light. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> I really like this for dandruff.  I only need to use it about once or twice a week to control dandruff.  It seems to have a lasting effect on controlling my scalp.  And it&#x27;s cheaper than many of the other dandruff shampoos.  BTW this is the Head and Shoulders you want... not the zinc one.  Selenium Sulfide does a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use it on my baby when she had really bad cradle cap... but I was desperate since nothing else was working.  She smelled like a dude for a day, but this really took care of the cradle cap.  It helped the smell to do a second rinse with a baby shampoo.  I would do it about once every week or 2 for about 3 months and never had to use it again.  I could tell it was working on her almost right away.  It really does a great job.  Now I wish i could get rid of the seborrheic dermatitis on my face...</li>
            <li> it works i recommend it</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I&#x27;ve had dandruff for years and after just a few days this cleared it up.Very impressed and such a pleasure to find something that really works</li>
            <li> This really calms my scalp and cleans and smells really good too!</li>
            <li> Great scent, love how it feels in my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product.  It really does what it says.  Great price.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my VERY oily hair. My hair has to be washed daily because it is so oily. This does not make me feel like a friz head, but it keeps my hair soft, while taking the oily feeling away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved to this shampoo from Selsun Blue for two main reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cheaper - you get two 14 oz bottles for $14, when with selsun you get one 11 oz bottle for $12, This means $0.5/oz in case of H&amp;S and $1/oz in case of Selsun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. More pleasant flavour - While this shampoo also does not have normal shampoo smell, it&#x27;s smell is much more pleasant than Selsun&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overal, highly reccomend!</li>
