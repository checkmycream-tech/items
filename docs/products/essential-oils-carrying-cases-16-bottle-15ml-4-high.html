            <li>The case is just the right size to carry around.</li>
            <li>A great small case to take oils on a trip.</li>

            <li>It stores all my different size oils and is very hand for home and travelling.</li>
            <li>The ones I got before (from another supplier) was in cotton jersey fabric (for the external layer) and looks and feel much nicer.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this little case.  It&#x27;s perfect for my 15ml essential oil bottles.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these. The pink bag is for oils that we can drink. (Not a problem since we use DoTerra oils and they are safe for drinking.) The blue bag is for oils that are better not being ingested. (tree-based oils, etc.) The bags make my oils easy to transport around the house and even out of the house.</li>
            <li> Great storage for Essential oils.</li>
            <li> This item arrived really quickly and was exactly what I wanted. It stores all my different size oils and is very hand for home and travelling. I also got a bonus free gift which was nice! I would definitely recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils and like to keep them organized.  Everything from the 5 ml bottles to the 15 ml bottles fits in here and allows me to have them at my fingertips.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect case for my essential oils.  The bottles stay in place; the bottles of oil are very well protected!  Excellent item!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and ships quickly and you&#x27;ll receive very quickly. Great for taking a few of your favorite oils and roll ons with you.</li>
            <li> I love this for my Young Living Essential Oils and am planning on purchasing more of these when I get more oils.  Well made and perfect size.</li>
            <li> Nice size case for taking just a few of my oils along with me!  Keeps them safe and is nicely made!</li>
            <li> This is a great case for holding essential oils. It can accomodate both the 5ml size and the 15ml size.</li>
            <li> Fits various sized bottles; works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so wonderful to have my oils neatly organized and protected from crashing together when I move them from place to place.</li>
            <li> A great small case to take oils on a trip.</li>
            <li> Safely holds 16 bottles of essential oils.  Bottles can be up to 15 ml in size.  I like the padding between the bottle spaces - provides protection for the glass bottles.  Color choice is a nice option to the buyer.  I purchased the blue with light blue interior.  Well-cushioned exterior fabric with small handle across the top.  Would be too large to carry in most ladies&#x27; purses, but would be perfect for suitcase travel or in a tote.  Zipper closure easy to operate, even with 16 bottles in the case.  I would recommend this product to a friend and am personally contemplating a second one for my increasing collection of oils.</li>
            <li> The ones I got before (from another supplier) was in cotton jersey fabric (for the external layer) and looks and feel much nicer.  And the finish was nicer too. I was expecting the same so am quite disappointed when I got this.</li>
            <li> I bought two of this smaller size case rather than one large one. This made it very manageable to put into my tote when visiting a client or travelling. I can fit both 15ml and 5ml bottles easily and they all have a nice snug fit. The individual compartments are not attached at the bottom, but since these are smaller cases, I had no problem with sagging. I think this feature would also make it easier to clean the case out if there was a mishap.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied and plan to get more. That way I can sort my oils and put each category into a different case. Since they come in varied colors, I can get a different color for each, which satisfies my love of organization.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I&#x27;m a little disappointed that the bottom isn&#x27;t sturdier. I have different sized bottles and I notice that if I use bigger bottles, it helps keep the smaller bottles in place. If I don&#x27;t fill up all the spaces, after a while, the bottles tend to slide and move out of their homes. I use a lot of 5ml bottles, but I have a few 15ml bottles in there as well. I also use glass bottles (with eyedroppers) and if I put them in some of the empty spaces they help keep the bottles in their respective homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish the strap was a tad sturdier feeling. Not that you&#x27;re expecting to carry a heavy load, but it would be good to have a thicker strap (for more security).</li>
            <li> Perfect size for essential oils.  I prefer this size since the larger one is too awkward.  Get two in different colors to organize your oils - works for me.</li>
            <li> This case holds my 5ml &amp; 15ml bottles and helps me be more organized for classes and travel!</li>
            <li> I use it for 1/3 ounce Rollon bottles its not a stable bag, its very soft so if you only have two or three bottles in there its not good but if you keep it full then it works but only if it&#x27;s sitting on something flat , because my bag is moving all around then the oils are not always in the right place hope this help you have a beautiful day.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t just perfect for my oils, it also fits snugly on the shelf in my medicine cabinet. I might need to get two more!</li>
            <li> Perfect for all your essential oils!!</li>
            <li> Love this thing! Perfect for traveling and never worry my oils will break!</li>
            <li> Great item to protect your oils.</li>
            <li> I love this little bag for carrying my essential oils. I keep more than 16 bottles since most are 5 ml bottles. Its very compact and easy to carry. A little expensive I thought but the product is good.</li>
            <li> It is nicely padded to carry around with you.</li>
            <li> The case is just the right size to carry around.</li>
            <li> I use this one, plus a larger one, to keep my essential oils safe in my home. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend it for travel, as the soft sides won&#x27;t help much if something larger crushes it. Still, it fits my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> Once again just what the doctor ordered thank you for a great Product</li>
            <li> Great padded case to store my oils, 15ml bottle fits easily. Love that the zippered top opens and folds back for easy access.  I pack it in the middle of my suit case when I&#x27;m flying, perfect.</li>
            <li> After buying two of this brands larger carrying case for essential oils I needed a taller case to hold the roller ball bottles. This is 4&amp;#34; high and perfect!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for.  Fits my 10 ml bottles nice and snug.  Yes, the handle is a little flimsy, but I&#x27;m not going to carrying it around like a lunch box.  ;)</li>
            <li> Perfect size for packing essential oils for travel and storage. Especially appreciate that the pockets for the oils can accommodate varying size bottles.</li>
            <li> It is a nice case that works just fine for my essencial oils.  The handle is nice too so it is easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Small, easy to use, sturdy, and holds all my oils with ease.  Makes travel and keeping oils together a breeze.</li>
            <li> Cute case, good enough to hold the oils, just the handle is FLIMSY. It needs a a thicker, wider handle.</li>
            <li> This little pouch worked perfectly to carry some of my oils on vacation.  It protected the bottles wonderfully in my suitcase.</li>
