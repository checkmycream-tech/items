            <li>This is a great bath for getting off to sleep or just relaxing, but it isn&#x27;t for the conservative bather!</li>
            <li>Wonderful bath bomb.</li>
            <li>even though that&#x27;s the best level for you to relax in.</li>

            <li>Smelled amazing for hours after and my skin felt great!</li>
            <li>Great experience and smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then an hour went by and the aroma was STILL in the air and the water STILL felt great (even after reheating it).</li>
            <li>It was so relaxing that I even had a great nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also if you ever seen Friends when Monica makes a bath for Chandler and used all of those girly things to make it feel great, Chandler was against it, but absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>It smelled really good too.</li>
            <li>I got this for family over the holidays and she loved it</li>
            <li>I, personally, love them!</li>
            <li>It is lovely!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>this is an amazing treat.</li>
            <li>The scent was nice - the seaweed was not.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The seaweed kind of grossed me out.</li>
            <li>It kind of took the enjoyment and relaxation out of it.  </li>
            <li>Nice and relaxing.  </li>
            <li>The smell is just lovely, kind of citrusy with a hint of flowers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color, and it has a fabulous clean smell...</li>
            <li>I LOVE this bath bomb.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many I have bought over the years.  </li>
            <li>It smells incredible, and if you want to avoid all of the seaweed getting everywhere, just put it in some old pantyhose</li>
            <li>The scent was OK, but still not long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>*much* better.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better - besides the tub - than sitting on the beach, sun warming your skin and feet dipped in the ocean.  </li>
            <li>Since then, she&#x27;s learned to expect a healthy supply of the soap every birthday and Christmas.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because these each smell sort of like a really potent margarita.</li>
            <li>This stuff turned the water the most awesome shade of blue.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of the ocean and</li>
            <li>I aboslutely love it.</li>
            <li>I personally enjoyed the smell-</li>
            <li>In fairness, I love the bubble bars so much better than the bombs.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, it turns the water a bright blue like the ocean which is very appealing.  </li>
            <li>The thing REALLY smells good.</li>
            <li>and when I follow with LUSH&#x27;s Fair Trade Foot Lotion, my feet are so comfortable!</li>
            <li>It truly feels like an adventure to bathe in it, and is a huge hit with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a bathtub to actually try it as a BATH bomb, but I can imagine how great it would feel.  </li>
            <li>I am so ridiculously excited about Amazon carrying their products now....</li>
            <li>And it turns your bath water the most amazing color of ocean water blue.</li>
            <li>DID NOT HAVE TO CLEAN</li>
            <li>Then you don&#x27;t have to clean your tub.</li>
            <li>but I bet this is about the right shade!</li>
            <li>This this was so cool.</li>
            <li>and I loved the low cost.</li>
            <li>Plus it didnt make the water feel as nice, nor did it make my skin smell or make it soft.</li>
            <li>bomb is moisturizing and highly scented, and the essential oils used are soothing and smell great.</li>
            <li>my first bath bomb, and boy was it fun!</li>
            <li>My favorite LUSH product.  </li>
            <li>Anything related to a bath, you will find that I&#x27;ve either tried it or own it.  </li>
            <li>and it disolved into my own private lagoon.</li>
            <li>the seaweed is an extra nice touch.  </li>
            <li>This Lush Bomb is on my top favorites list.</li>
            <li>It takes like 1 second for it to start a really nice aroma in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>This was the very first Lush product I tried and it is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, the smell was overwhelmingly powerful.</li>
            <li>I also thought the color change of the water was beautiful; it was a mixture of light and dark blue.</li>
            <li>my skin is always softer after I use big blue, and it always smells great.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my skin feel soft and the scent wasn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li>, however when I got home to try it, the smell was actually kind of sweet smelling rather then dead fish smelling.  </li>
            <li>It did seem pretty moisturizing, but...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>the jacuzzi story was funny.</li>
            <li>I love how it turns the water ocean blue and has tons of hydrating seaweed in it.</li>
            <li>It smells salty, blue, fresh and crisp with pure Atlantic Sea Salt Crystals, Arame Seaweed, Lemon Oil, Lavender Oil, Seaweed Absolute with that gorgeous blue color</li>
            <li>The salt melts into the water and it all turns this gorgeous deep blue.</li>
            <li>The smell of the Cotton Candy one did smell good, but barely lasted long (maybe 20-30 minutes).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like heavy, flowery perfumes, so Big Blue&#x27;s light bracing aroma is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>But once in the water it was very calming.</li>
            <li>They practically smell up my whole house.  </li>
            <li>so I knew that it had seaweed, yet there was much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Then I stepped in and was immediately feeling relaxed thanks to the soothing smell and just the way the water felt.</li>
            <li>Not that I care that much about that, but for those of you who do, I&#x27;m just letting you know.  </li>
            <li>Not that I care that much about that, but for those of you who do, I&#x27;m just letting you know.  </li>
            <li>Make soaking in the bath a real treat.</li>
            <li>WAY too much seaweed felt like I was lying in a bathtub with worms.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure big blue meant the earth</li>
            <li>If you are a first time user of Lush and really wanting to experience the luxury of their products, I would recommend trying one of the \\&quot;candy-scented\\&quot; bubble bars.  </li>
            <li>After sniffing around the shop on a recent visit to Victoria, I discovered that the Big Blue and Ocean Salt cleanser make a big, happy, complimentary-smelling family, so my sister&#x27;s supply of bath products has increased exponentially.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients; we wrapped these up in fancy cloth and gave them out as party favors; much appreciated by all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seaweed is very slippery and doesn&#x27;t stick to my skin, which is important, but you may like to get a little strainer for the drain if you are going to use a lot of Lush bath bombs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really can get away with breaking these in half to use, but for the occasional special treat, try the whole shebang!</li>
            <li>It releases a maelstrom of fizz and scent, and colors the water a rich blue color (I wish the ocean looked that blue!)</li>
            <li>Be sure to put it in a small piece of hosiery if you don&#x27;t want to be floating in spider-leg-like pieces of seaweed.  </li>
            <li>have been harboring a dormant lush addiction for about six years now, and I live nowhere close to one.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m lying in a tub full of big blue water I close my eyes and pretend I&#x27;m a mermaid.</li>
            <li>and when I get home, I crumble some of the Big Blue into my foot spa and it deodorizes and relieves my feet so quickly.  </li>
            <li>The strands of seaweed stuck all over my bathtub and were not very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this with any of Lush&#x27;s citrusy products.</li>
            <li>This is the 4th Lush one I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>friend sent me some Lush goodies a year ago</li>
            <li>Everytime I purchase from Lush</li>
            <li>My skin was soooo soft when I got out.</li>
            <li>LUSH even sent me a &#x27;freebie&#x27; bomb.</li>
            <li>Did it make my skin smell or make it soft.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of Lush products.  </li>
            <li>We have yet to try something from Lush that we didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>Big Blue turns your water this turquoise-blue-ish colour that looks really similar to clean ocean water in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>it looks like black paint chips floating in the water - but still cool.</li>
            <li>It reminded me of little severed spider legs, and it was a pain to clean up.</li>
            <li>everytime I go into a lush store, big blue is one of the first things I buy.  </li>
            <li>I all but drug her down to Lush to get a fresh supply.  </li>
            <li>I found it funny, but got curious about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like them, and the moisturizing effect they have on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Left my skin sooo soft!</li>
            <li>Big Blue really does turn into sea with crystal blue water and natural seaweed.  </li>
            <li>highly reccomend their \\&quot;Ocean Salt\\&quot; scrub to complement big blue!</li>
            <li>For a less messy but just as enjoyable bathtub experience</li>
            <li>the salts in big blue act as a natural exfoliant, which I am all for.  </li>
            <li>It was definetly different than just regular old bath water spiced with shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this Big Blue  in the store (though it really smelt like the ocean... dried seaweed and all!)</li>
            <li>The real sea salt works as an anti-inflammatory and helps any swelling go down also.</li>

            <li> Everytime I purchase from Lush</li>
            <li> My skin was soooo soft when I got out.</li>
            <li> LUSH even sent me a &#x27;freebie&#x27; bomb.</li>
            <li> Did it make my skin smell or make it soft.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Lush products.  </li>
            <li> We have yet to try something from Lush that we didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> Big Blue turns your water this turquoise-blue-ish colour that looks really similar to clean ocean water in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> it looks like black paint chips floating in the water - but still cool.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of little severed spider legs, and it was a pain to clean up.</li>
            <li> everytime I go into a lush store, big blue is one of the first things I buy.  </li>
            <li> I all but drug her down to Lush to get a fresh supply.  </li>
            <li> I found it funny, but got curious about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like them, and the moisturizing effect they have on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Left my skin sooo soft!</li>
            <li> Big Blue really does turn into sea with crystal blue water and natural seaweed.  </li>
            <li> highly reccomend their \\&quot;Ocean Salt\\&quot; scrub to complement big blue!</li>
            <li> For a less messy but just as enjoyable bathtub experience</li>
            <li> the salts in big blue act as a natural exfoliant, which I am all for.  </li>
            <li> It was definetly different than just regular old bath water spiced with shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this Big Blue  in the store (though it really smelt like the ocean... dried seaweed and all!)</li>
            <li> The real sea salt works as an anti-inflammatory and helps any swelling go down also.</li>
            <li> My sister has been a Sea Vegetable soap junkie since I first discovered one of the Vancouvers shop in the late 1990s and went nuts shopping for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it, right now, to all of you, I am addicted to baths.  </li>
            <li> poor me, right?</li>
            <li> When I drop it in the tub, and it fizzles its little bubbles, it turns your bathtub into a deep blue Ocean!  </li>
            <li> The seaweed in the bomb also helps to soften my rough feet</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail a couple of months ago and never really even opened the box.</li>
            <li> Loved the bath, just hated cleaning out the tub afterwords.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as good as the Big Blue.</li>
            <li> Definitely a must have, at least for me.</li>
            <li> As you can see, either you&#x27;ll love the seaweed bits floating in the tub or you&#x27;ll hate them.</li>
            <li> Cleanup wasn&#x27;t an issue since the seaweed was sucked down by the drain.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to let the seaweed go down the drain.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the bits of seaweed were going to be so firm and dark...</li>
            <li> This one leaves a little mess for you</li>
            <li> In my experience, they are much less messy than flower petals, and easier to rinse away.</li>
            <li> and releases little seaweed pieces into the bath.</li>
            <li> The little bits of seaweed is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes of reading, I had an itch on my leg and went to scratch it and was thought to myself \\&quot;Dang my skin is soft\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Did not enjoy the smell and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll sit in the bath for at least an hour, reheating the water, and then getting aggravated at the dumb safety thing that sucks the water out of the tub if it gets to high...</li>
            <li> remindes me of the times I did bathe in the Ocean, and for a few bucks it makes that feeling a repetitive experience.</li>
            <li> But, my complaint about this product is the mess that it leaves in your bathtub.  </li>
            <li> By the time I figured out what was going on - it was a little late.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely gonna order another one of these bad boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> I am also addicted to bath stuff.  </li>
            <li> Sorry about that.</li>
            <li> Even after I tried off, the smell was still on me and that aint a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This this was so cool. When I first opened it, the smell was overwhelmingly powerful. But once in the water it was very calming. I didn&#x27;t realize the bits of seaweed were going to be so firm and dark... it looks like black paint chips floating in the water - but still cool.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this bath bomb.  I don&#x27;t know how many I have bought over the years.  It&#x27;s a beautiful color, and it has a fabulous clean smell... for all of those laundry detergent lovers, this will make you sooo happy... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been harboring a dormant lush addiction for about six years now, and I live nowhere close to one.  My only solace has been whenever friends and relatives visit a city with one (like Toronto) I send money with them and tell them what to buy.  I have yet to be dissatisfied with something that I bought from this comany.  I am so ridiculously excited about Amazon carrying their products now....</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and just as described! Thank you!</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients; we wrapped these up in fancy cloth and gave them out as party favors; much appreciated by all.</li>
            <li> This bath bomb is to die for. Be warned - if you don&#x27;t like floaties, it is not for you. Or you can stick it in a stocking, which will catch all of the seaweed. I, personally, love them! They tickle and add to the ambiance.     The smell is SO ocean. The salt melts into the water and it all turns this gorgeous deep blue. Between Sex Bomb, Twilight, and Big Blue, I always have my classics on hand!    I would recommend this with any of Lush&#x27;s citrusy products. - eg with the You&#x27;ve been Mangoed bath melt, a piece of the Each Peach and Two&#x27;s a Pear massage bar, or either Ocean Salt or Big Shampoo. The smells are awesome together!!!</li>
            <li> everytime I go into a lush store, big blue is one of the first things I buy.  Big Blue turns your water this turquoise-blue-ish colour that looks really similar to clean ocean water in Hawaii.  my skin is always softer after I use big blue, and it always smells great.  the salts in big blue act as a natural exfoliant, which I am all for.  big blue is one of those bath bombs where the smell lingers on you for a couple of days.  It smells incredible, and if you want to avoid all of the seaweed getting everywhere, just put it in some old pantyhose and you&#x27;re set to go.</li>
            <li> It smells like the ocean if you could smell the lavender growing up on the cliffs.  My favorite LUSH product.  Lounge in teal colored water and breathe in the calming scent.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th Lush one I&#x27;ve tried.  Out of all of them, I liked this one the best.  The scent was OK, but still not long-lasting.  Anyway, I like the ones from Haute Tub *much* better.  Their buttercream frosting, candy cane crunch and pumpkin pie all smell great.  They practically smell up my whole house.  Just thought I&#x27;d share.</li>
            <li> The scent was nice - the seaweed was not.  Esepcially in a jacuzzi tub.  By the time I figured out what was going on - it was a little late.     Taking apart the jacuzzi after a bath sort of defeats the purpose of a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> Big Blue really does turn into sea with crystal blue water and natural seaweed.  It reminds me of the coast of Ireland where I went on a vacation.  Best version of the ocean for home use (and sand-free).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bath girl.  I&#x27;ll admit it, right now, to all of you, I am addicted to baths.  I am also addicted to bath stuff.  Anything related to a bath, you will find that I&#x27;ve either tried it or own it.  To me, heaven is a bathtub with some sort of goodness in the water.  Just.Love.It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend sent me some Lush goodies a year ago so when I went to visit her in Boston I all but drug her down to Lush to get a fresh supply.  As soon as I got home, in went Big Blue and I started my vacation - again.  There is nothing better - besides the tub - than sitting on the beach, sun warming your skin and feet dipped in the ocean.  This bath bomb brings it all back, including the seaweed to go between your toes!  The smell, the feel, even the color is nothing but the Big Blue.  Added perk of Big Blue was that the seaweed clogged the overflow valve so I got to immerse myself even deeper into the waters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend their \\&quot;Ocean Salt\\&quot; scrub to complement big blue!</li>
            <li> my first bath bomb, and boy was it fun! can&#x27;t help feeling like a queen after using one of these to pamper myself. smells great too and it doesn&#x27;t stain the tub.</li>
            <li> This was the very first Lush product I tried and it is my absolute favorite. Everytime I purchase from Lush I always get 1 or 2 of these. The smell is just lovely, kind of citrusy with a hint of flowers. And it turns your bath water the most amazing color of ocean water blue. When I&#x27;m lying in a tub full of big blue water I close my eyes and pretend I&#x27;m a mermaid. Definitely a must have, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this Big Blue  in the store (though it really smelt like the ocean... dried seaweed and all!), however when I got home to try it, the smell was actually kind of sweet smelling rather then dead fish smelling.  Thank goodness because I found this to be the best bath bomb to use to soothe sore and achy feet.  I work retail, so I&#x27;m on my feet for hours at a time and when I get home, I crumble some of the Big Blue into my foot spa and it deodorizes and relieves my feet so quickly.  The real sea salt works as an anti-inflammatory and helps any swelling go down also. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a bathtub to actually try it as a BATH bomb, but I can imagine how great it would feel.  The seaweed in the bomb also helps to soften my rough feet and when I follow with LUSH&#x27;s Fair Trade Foot Lotion, my feet are so comfortable!</li>
            <li> My sister has been a Sea Vegetable soap junkie since I first discovered one of the Vancouvers shop in the late 1990s and went nuts shopping for Christmas. Since then, she&#x27;s learned to expect a healthy supply of the soap every birthday and Christmas. After sniffing around the shop on a recent visit to Victoria, I discovered that the Big Blue and Ocean Salt cleanser make a big, happy, complimentary-smelling family, so my sister&#x27;s supply of bath products has increased exponentially. The best part is, guys love this stuff, too! I think it&#x27;s because these each smell sort of like a really potent margarita.</li>
            <li> This is a great bath for getting off to sleep or just relaxing, but it isn&#x27;t for the conservative bather! It releases a maelstrom of fizz and scent, and colors the water a rich blue color (I wish the ocean looked that blue!) and releases little seaweed pieces into the bath. It truly feels like an adventure to bathe in it, and is a huge hit with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seaweed is very slippery and doesn&#x27;t stick to my skin, which is important, but you may like to get a little strainer for the drain if you are going to use a lot of Lush bath bombs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bomb is moisturizing and highly scented, and the essential oils used are soothing and smell great. You really can get away with breaking these in half to use, but for the occasional special treat, try the whole shebang! It is lovely!</li>
            <li> This stuff turned the water the most awesome shade of blue. I have never been to the ocean (poor me, right? lol) but I bet this is about the right shade! It smelled really good too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The seaweed kind of grossed me out. It reminded me of little severed spider legs, and it was a pain to clean up. It did seem pretty moisturizing, but... I just could have done without the seaweed.</li>
            <li> I put this into my tub and it disolved into my own private lagoon. I absolutely love the smell of the ocean and the seaweed is an extra nice touch.  I wish I could afford to use one of these every night!</li>
            <li> Has stuff that floats in the water, which I personally did not like.  Didn&#x27;t make my skin feel soft and the scent wasn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li> This Lush Bomb is on my top favorites list. When I drop it in the tub, and it fizzles its little bubbles, it turns your bathtub into a deep blue Ocean!  It smells salty, blue, fresh and crisp with pure Atlantic Sea Salt Crystals, Arame Seaweed, Lemon Oil, Lavender Oil, Seaweed Absolute with that gorgeous blue color this is an amazing treat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This remindes me of the times I did bathe in the Ocean, and for a few bucks it makes that feeling a repetitive experience. I aboslutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! The little bits of seaweed is an added bonus. Smells just like a vacation in a ball. The smell was in my bathroom the next day. Left my skin sooo soft! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Smelled amazing for hours after and my skin felt great!</li>
            <li> I got this for family over the holidays and she loved it and I loved the low cost.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews before I got this one so I knew that it had seaweed, yet there was much more than I expected. Cleanup wasn&#x27;t an issue since the seaweed was sucked down by the drain. I personally enjoyed the smell- it reminded me of the breeze coming from the ocean. I also thought the color change of the water was beautiful; it was a mixture of light and dark blue. Overall, made me feel like I was taking a dip in the water at the beach. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t mind getting this one again.</li>
            <li> As you can see, either you&#x27;ll love the seaweed bits floating in the tub or you&#x27;ll hate them. I really like them, and the moisturizing effect they have on my dry skin. In my experience, they are much less messy than flower petals, and easier to rinse away. I don&#x27;t like heavy, flowery perfumes, so Big Blue&#x27;s light bracing aroma is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Loved the bath, just hated cleaning out the tub afterwords. This one leaves a little mess for you but boy is it ever relaxing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful bath bomb. Great experience and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID NOT HAVE TO CLEAN MY TUB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay people!!! You are supposed to let the seaweed go down the drain. Then you don&#x27;t have to clean your tub. The seaweed will turn into algae when it gets to the ocean thus creating food for sea life. This was the purpose of this bath bomb. Pretty sure big blue meant the earth entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also the jacuzzi story was funny. Sorry about that. But yeah... Would not recommend this for a jacuzzi</li>
            <li> Oh, my gosh. This bomb is da bomb. I love how it turns the water ocean blue and has tons of hydrating seaweed in it. My skin was soooo soft when I got out. I will get this again.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail a couple of months ago and never really even opened the box. I take like one or two bath&#x27;s a year. I&#x27;m a shower guy. When I do take a bath, I dont have a bottle of bubbles to go with it. I just use a bottle of shampoo. What I do like to do is read though while I do take that bath. I&#x27;ll sit in the bath for at least an hour, reheating the water, and then getting aggravated at the dumb safety thing that sucks the water out of the tub if it gets to high...even though that&#x27;s the best level for you to relax in. BUT..on to the Bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I would try one of these things out after hearing about it from a lady friend of mine. Also if you ever seen Friends when Monica makes a bath for Chandler and used all of those girly things to make it feel great, Chandler was against it, but absolutely loved it. I found it funny, but got curious about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And well..wow. The thing REALLY smells good. It takes like 1 second for it to start a really nice aroma in the bathroom. Then I stepped in and was immediately feeling relaxed thanks to the soothing smell and just the way the water felt. It was definetly different than just regular old bath water spiced with shampoo. After a few minutes of reading, I had an itch on my leg and went to scratch it and was thought to myself \\&quot;Dang my skin is soft\\&quot;. Then an hour went by and the aroma was STILL in the air and the water STILL felt great (even after reheating it). Once I was done I thought that would be it. NOPE. Even after I tried off, the smell was still on me and that aint a bad thing. It was so relaxing that I even had a great nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely gonna order another one of these bad boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus LUSH even sent me a &#x27;freebie&#x27; bomb. It was some Cotton Candy one. Definitely not as good as the Big Blue. The smell of the Cotton Candy one did smell good, but barely lasted long (maybe 20-30 minutes). Plus it didnt make the water feel as nice, nor did it make my skin smell or make it soft. Not that I care that much about that, but for those of you who do, I&#x27;m just letting you know.  &#x3D;Did it make my skin smell or make it soft. Not that I care that much about that, but for those of you who do, I&#x27;m just letting you know.  &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> The sea salt, lemon oil, and lavender oil are a relaxing, yet invigorating combination.  On top of that, it turns the water a bright blue like the ocean which is very appealing.  But, my complaint about this product is the mess that it leaves in your bathtub.  The strands of seaweed stuck all over my bathtub and were not very easy to clean.  It kind of took the enjoyment and relaxation out of it.  For a less messy but just as enjoyable bathtub experience I recommend their Bathos bubble bar instead.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Lush products.  This one is not for me.  Did not enjoy the smell and the seaweed in it was definitely a turn-off.  Be sure to put it in a small piece of hosiery if you don&#x27;t want to be floating in spider-leg-like pieces of seaweed.  In fairness, I love the bubble bars so much better than the bombs.  If you are a first time user of Lush and really wanting to experience the luxury of their products, I would recommend trying one of the \\&quot;candy-scented\\&quot; bubble bars.  They are all to die for!!</li>
            <li> Nice and relaxing.  We have yet to try something from Lush that we didn&#x27;t like.  Make soaking in the bath a real treat.</li>
            <li> WAY too much seaweed felt like I was lying in a bathtub with worms. Horrible. Will not buy again.</li>
