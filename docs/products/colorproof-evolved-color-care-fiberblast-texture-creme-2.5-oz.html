            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be a great substitute to PureOlogy&#x27;s Texture Twist (both Colorproof and PureOlogy were created by Jim Markham) in terms of styling.  </li>

            <li>I wanted to give it an honest try.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to write that I am very satisfied with FiberBlast.</li>
            <li>great product and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>nice product, just don&#x27;t use a lot, better to use as a finishing product to keep curls up.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Overall, the best replacement I&#x27;ve found for my much-loved, discontinued Texture Twist.</li>
            <li>This product is ok, but leaves my hair drier than Texture Twist did and doesn&#x27;t hold as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK substitute for Aveda Texture Twist</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I think it works as well or better than the discontinued Pureology Texture Twist.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair care product.  </li>
            <li>You are hurting the businesses that go through the appropriate channels to obtain and sell these products.</li>
            <li>But better than most that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>love the product.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it is not greasy or waxy, giving a nice definition with a light hold.</li>
            <li>Yes, I love the product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something similar and it is the best that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This is the best product that I have used for my short hair for style and volume.</li>
            <li>FiberBlast works perfectly for my long and curly hair.</li>
            <li>It is not the EXACT product as TT, but a good replacement.</li>
            <li>so I tried this product reviewed by a user and found it to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>I have fine textured hair.  </li>
            <li>I was a huge fan of Texture Twist.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and like it to look separated and this product works great for that without leaving it greasy looking.</li>
            <li>Fiber Blast is great for uber short hair styles !</li>
            <li>I  use to use texture twist but no longer available</li>
            <li>It works great on my short hair to give it volume and style.</li>
            <li>After blow drying can style with my fingers to break it up and not be so smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still soft with a fair amount of control.  </li>
            <li>It was created by the same man who created the original pureology line and is a great replacement for the now discontinued TextureTwist.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair but very fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>especially if you loved Pureology Texture Twist....</li>
            <li>Great product but not enough for someone who really wants the stay and lift as the original.</li>
            <li>They have the REAL product and it worth EVERY every penny!!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly with no problem.</li>
            <li>This product is one of my favorite, and I am constantly looking for better texturizers.</li>
            <li>Gives it great body and does not weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li>This should be a 4 star review, but I love the product so much I am overlooking that two of the many containers I have purchased were defective, pump barely put out any product</li>
            <li>It does have a mild floral scent but it fades right away.</li>
            <li>I know for a FACT that these products that are purchased over the internet are NOT THE REAL THING….they are either a diluted version or cheap shampoo poured into the bottle.</li>
            <li>Buy THE REAL fantastic Colorproof from your local salon.</li>
            <li>The smell is different than Texture Twist, but it&#x27;s nice -</li>
            <li>This was ok for the price but comes nowhere near Purology twist and texture</li>
            <li>I find it sliiiiiiightly less &amp;#34;fibrous&amp;#34; than Texture Twist, but it is still effective for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>- you had to push several times to get what normally comes out in one push on the good containers.  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant because over the years I had tried other products when I was out of TT, and could never find a good replacement.</li>
            <li>only better</li>
            <li>I love this product the day I use it, but I must wash my hair the very next day.</li>
            <li>To all those who love these products, support your local salons and stylists by purchasing them.</li>
            <li>However, the scent is so strong it gives me massive headaches when I use the product.  </li>
            <li>so I can &amp;#34;texure&amp;#34; it into a certain look.</li>
            <li>It really adds texture and is the finishing touch to styling my hair.</li>
            <li>will have to save up and buy the real deal.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier then trying to get texture creme from a jar.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you really want texture, this is the stuff to buy.</li>
            <li>Holds very well.</li>
            <li>Indispensable for girls with short hair!</li>
            <li>It is very fragrant, but it does not stay strong for long.</li>
            <li>Can use more, or less - just experiment.  </li>
            <li>Once I gave this new product a true chance, I realize that it is very similar.</li>
            <li>Much like the old Texture twist by Pureology....</li>
            <li>The product does not dull your hair.  </li>
            <li>If Colorproof will tone down the strength (or remove) the scent, it will be a fantastic product.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to Texture Twist, use about the same amount of product, or slightly less and work your way up to using more.</li>
            <li>Gives just enough texture to really</li>
            <li>It has a little fragrance but not a bad smell and is under $20 a bottle.  </li>
            <li>It is of the same premise, but thinner and does not have the thick texturing  quality as the original.</li>

            <li> More is not better - takes a SMALL amount!</li>
            <li> This bottle will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Can go as spikey as you want, or just a bit less (and I&#x27;m an old woman).  </li>
            <li> Works with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit about the size of an english pea.</li>
            <li> Texturizes well without being too wet or too sticky.</li>
            <li> It has just enough hold but does not make your hair stiff.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t color it, she on the other hand does and does.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a SMALL amount.</li>
            <li> It keeps my short hair edgy but not spikey.</li>
            <li> After sleeping on product in hair, tends to matt down style.</li>
            <li> Edit:  If you are in agreement about the strength of the scent, please contact Colorproof at the link below requesting them to change or tone down the scent of the product.    </li>
            <li> It dries down and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> So not quite the hold previously.  </li>
            <li> should, gives my hair a little body</li>
            <li> Seriously I don&#x27;t have a grey hair on my head</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feel or a greasy touch.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to keep my hair neat and in place.</li>
            <li> Dried out product.</li>
            <li> We find purchasing on line is less expensive than in a big box store.</li>
            <li> says it prevents color loss, not sure of that.</li>
            <li> DON’T waste your money on products that are not certified ColorProof!</li>
            <li> I thought I hated it at first, but soon realized that I was just missing my TT.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as thick as the Texture Twist I used before.  </li>
            <li> ColorProof has an anti-diversion program that they take very seriously to uphold the integrity of their products.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ILLEGAL to sell ColorProof over the internet.</li>
            <li> This is dangerous to purchasers not knowing what they are truly getting and putting on their hair &amp; scalp.</li>
            <li> I do not find it overpowering or unpleasant.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is a great replacement for the Texture Twist product from Pureology.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have short hair and like it to look separated and this product works great for that without leaving it greasy looking.</li>
            <li> FiberBlast works perfectly for my long and curly hair. Doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feel or a greasy touch. The only downside is the quantity. I wish the bottle was bigger!</li>
            <li> Re-writing my review after months of use and keeping 5 stars:  This should be a 4 star review, but I love the product so much I am overlooking that two of the many containers I have purchased were defective, pump barely put out any product - you had to push several times to get what normally comes out in one push on the good containers.  This would not be such an issue, but the container seems to be solid (does not come apart), so you have to work at getting all the product out.  That said, I am staying a 5 on my review because the product is the best for a guys hair (hold without drying or damaging)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Gives just enough texture to really &amp;#34;do something&amp;#34; with your hair.  Can use more, or less - just experiment.  Can go as spikey as you want, or just a bit less (and I&#x27;m an old woman).  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  Much like the old Texture twist by Pureology....only better</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of Colorproof Fiberberblast Texture Creme. It really adds texture and is the finishing touch to styling my hair. Helps to hold your style all day. I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It is the closest product I have tried that is similar to Purelogy&#x27;s Texture Twist.</li>
            <li> Excellent product in great shape. Shipped quickly with no problem.</li>
            <li> Packaging is identical to Texture Twist in terms of size of container, weight, shape of packaging, and method of dispensing. If you&#x27;re used to Texture Twist, use about the same amount of product, or slightly less and work your way up to using more. I find it sliiiiiiightly less &amp;#34;fibrous&amp;#34; than Texture Twist, but it is still effective for my fine hair. The smell is different than Texture Twist, but it&#x27;s nice - I do not find it overpowering or unpleasant. Overall, the best replacement I&#x27;ve found for my much-loved, discontinued Texture Twist.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time in great condition. Fiber Blast is great for uber short hair styles ! Holds all day, nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this produce hoping it would be a good replacement for Texture Twist. It is not the same. This product is ok, but leaves my hair drier than Texture Twist did and doesn&#x27;t hold as well.</li>
            <li> This was ok for the price but comes nowhere near Purology twist and texture I was wanting to find a substitute for. Don&#x27;t think I will buy it again will have to save up and buy the real deal.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price is great.</li>
            <li> nice product, just don&#x27;t use a lot, better to use as a finishing product to keep curls up. says it prevents color loss, not sure of that. After sleeping on product in hair, tends to matt down style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK substitute for Aveda Texture Twist</li>
            <li> Love this hair product!</li>
            <li> I love this product ! I  use to use texture twist but no longer available so they designed this product &amp; it&#x27;s better!</li>
            <li> Repeat user (or rather my wife is). Seriously I don&#x27;t have a grey hair on my head and I don&#x27;t color it, she on the other hand does and does.  She has had me buy it several times.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace the texture twist which has been discontinued.  It is of the same premise, but thinner and does not have the thick texturing  quality as the original. Great product but not enough for someone who really wants the stay and lift as the original. Pureology, we miss your texture twist!</li>
            <li> I waited a while after receiving this product to review it. I wanted to give it an honest try. I was a huge fan of Texture Twist. I was devastated when they discontinued it- but was told to give this a try. I was very hesitant because over the years I had tried other products when I was out of TT, and could never find a good replacement. I am pleased to write that I am very satisfied with FiberBlast. It is very fragrant, but it does not stay strong for long. It is not the EXACT product as TT, but a good replacement. I thought I hated it at first, but soon realized that I was just missing my TT. Once I gave this new product a true chance, I realize that it is very similar. I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I think it works as well or better than the discontinued Pureology Texture Twist. It does have a mild floral scent but it fades right away.</li>
            <li> I was amazed the Pureology discontinued their &amp;#34;Antifade Texturetwist Complex&amp;#34; and you have to pay close to $80 for a bottle so I tried this product reviewed by a user and found it to work just fine.  It has a little fragrance but not a bad smell and is under $20 a bottle.  Works like it should, gives my hair a little body so I can &amp;#34;texure&amp;#34; it into a certain look.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier then trying to get texture creme from a jar.  And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair care product.  I recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I love this product the day I use it, but I must wash my hair the very next day. For that reason, I&#x27;m not a fan...sorry.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and I love this product! It has just enough hold but does not make your hair stiff.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product! It was created by the same man who created the original pureology line and is a great replacement for the now discontinued TextureTwist.  It works great on my short hair to give it volume and style.</li>
            <li> This is the best alternative/substitute I&#x27;ve found for Pureology Texture Twist. Good stuff@</li>
            <li> THIS IS ILLEGAL to sell ColorProof over the internet. SHAME ON Amazon for allowing this to happen!!! Only licensed hairstylists are allowed to sell these from their salons. I know for a FACT that these products that are purchased over the internet are NOT THE REAL THING….they are either a diluted version or cheap shampoo poured into the bottle. ColorProof has an anti-diversion program that they take very seriously to uphold the integrity of their products. This is dangerous to purchasers not knowing what they are truly getting and putting on their hair &amp; scalp. DON’T waste your money on products that are not certified ColorProof! Buy THE REAL fantastic Colorproof from your local salon. These products can only be guaranteed through a salon that has an authorized account through ColorProof. EVERYONE should alert AMAZON this seller and others like. You are hurting the businesses that go through the appropriate channels to obtain and sell these products. To all those who love these products, support your local salons and stylists by purchasing them. They have the REAL product and it worth EVERY every penny!! BEWARE DON’T PURCHASE FROM: BEAUTY IT IS</li>
            <li> I have fine textured hair.  I use about 1/8-1/4 inch of this product before drying my hair.  Gives it great body and does not weigh down my hair.  After blow drying can style with my fingers to break it up and not be so smooth.  More is not better - takes a SMALL amount!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as thick as the Texture Twist I used before.  So not quite the hold previously.  But better than most that I&#x27;ve used. I have a lot of hair but very fine, straight hair so that doesn&#x27;t help. Great Price!</li>
            <li> Great product as always. I use it everyday to keep my hair neat and in place. I will order again.</li>
            <li> love the product.  It keeps my short hair edgy but not spikey.</li>
            <li> great product and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> This product is one of my favorite, and I am constantly looking for better texturizers. I like it because it is not greasy or waxy, giving a nice definition with a light hold. It smells good, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be a great substitute to PureOlogy&#x27;s Texture Twist (both Colorproof and PureOlogy were created by Jim Markham) in terms of styling.  However, the scent is so strong it gives me massive headaches when I use the product.  If Colorproof will tone down the strength (or remove) the scent, it will be a fantastic product.    Edit:  If you are in agreement about the strength of the scent, please contact Colorproof at the link below requesting them to change or tone down the scent of the product.    http://www.colorproof.com/colorproof-contact-us</li>
            <li> Works well.  Thinner than texture twist, but a good alternative.</li>
            <li> I used Pureology Texture Twist for years, but it was discontinued.  The Fiberblast is made by the same guy, and is almost identical.</li>
            <li> Dried out product. Unusable.</li>
            <li> My hair is still soft with a fair amount of control.  The product does not dull your hair.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. If you really want texture, this is the stuff to buy. You only need a dime size amount. It dries down and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Texturizes well without being too wet or too sticky. Holds very well. Works with wet or dry hair. Indispensable for girls with short hair!</li>
            <li> My sister is a beautician of 30+ years and she recommended this to me. I wear my hair really short. It works great for finishing up my styling by lifting and separating my layers. It gives a good shine too. I&#x27;ll buy this again. It only takes a SMALL amount. I use a little bit about the size of an english pea. This bottle will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love the product.</li>
            <li> Great product....especially if you loved Pureology Texture Twist....I was looking for something similar and it is the best that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> My wife has just started using this item and has good reports about it.  We find purchasing on line is less expensive than in a big box store.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have used for my short hair for style and volume. My hair always looks great since I have been using this</li>
