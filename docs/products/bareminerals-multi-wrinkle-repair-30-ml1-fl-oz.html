            <li>I love it like I love all their products!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love their foundations, and used this as an all over moisturizer for my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and smell.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite skin care product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>This makes skin look brighter and more radiant</li>
            <li>so I thought since I love the makeup and brushes</li>
            <li>I see no reduction in the fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>It is fantastic and results happen within days .  </li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels after I apply this serum to the target areas (which are mainly my expression lines)!</li>
            <li>This is a very light, non greasy formula that feels as though nothing is on my skin when the humidity is high.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and highly recommend to those who purchase BareMineral products.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on beautifully, feels great on the skin and is a good base for Bare Minerals makeup.</li>
            <li>I am 54 and have good skin, but dry and lines are coming in.</li>
            <li>High priced, but it does last quite awhile and is a very nice serum.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found, and it&#x27;s a nice light and even base for foundation.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>better than normal, really.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem like very much</li>
            <li>I am seventy four years old and my skin is basically wrinkle free .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>but I love the whole bare minerals line.</li>
            <li>However, when I first went to use it, I thought it was defective because I pumped and pumped and nothing came out.  </li>
            <li>Hope it will aid in the large ones as time goes on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day over a month in conjunction with the Purely Nourishing Cream.</li>
            <li>and I use with the purely nourishing cream at night over this.</li>
            <li>Appears to be making some of my fine line wrinkles disappear in only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels and works.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much though.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay $50 for a moisturizer, and I&#x27;m young enough that I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, but I ended up spending well over 50 bucks trying to find a moisturizer that was light, effective on my combination skin (dry and peel in some areas, very oily in others and prone to break outs), and this one was the only one that didn&#x27;t make me greasy, kept me from peeling, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts, helped the ones I had to heal better with less scarring, and I almost shelled out $50 to get it at the store, but thought I should check amazon first.</li>
            <li>I am seeing some aging as I get older</li>
            <li>I got a tiny free sample of this with a purchase from a bare minerals store.</li>
            <li>This product was not the same as my originally purchased Bare Minerals Anti-wrinkle repair.</li>
            <li>With a prime membership I got it for $40 in two days with free shipping, and my face is finally getting back to normal again.</li>
            <li>only reason I purchased this product was that it really works.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old</li>
            <li>I tried a sample from the Bare Minerals store and used it all up.</li>

            <li> Obviously a grey market item.</li>
            <li> After using this stuff for a week they are significantly less obvious.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks, so</li>
            <li> but they are not really very defined .</li>
            <li> It came without a box, missing a piece of the pump, and was distinctly different in texture and smell.</li>
            <li> and it seems almost empty.  </li>
            <li> Other than that this product works well.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would at least  make a tiny difference, but that was not the case.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;ll be a little bit longer than nature intended before I get them.</li>
            <li> I am 30 and have a few fine lines/wrinkles that I hate.  </li>
            <li> I like the product, but when I received the bottle, the straw thats supposed to be inside the bottle to help dispense the liquid was missing.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce wrinkles and firm skin up.</li>
            <li> maybe it was a small amount softer.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>

            <li> This product goes on beautifully, feels great on the skin and is a good base for Bare Minerals makeup. It smells nice, too. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s wrinkle repair claims.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would at least  make a tiny difference, but that was not the case. I saw no difference in my skin at all except maybe it was a small amount softer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Made my skin feel so good plus I noticed a differents with the unwanted wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is the best anti wrinkle product I have ever found !  It is fantastic and results happen within days .  I am seventy four years old and my skin is basically wrinkle free .  I have some lines...but they are not really very defined . I will forever use this product .</li>
            <li> I keep buying this.  I love it.  Not oily or sticky and I wear my make-up over it.</li>
            <li> Appears to be making some of my fine line wrinkles disappear in only 2 weeks. Hope it will aid in the large ones as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my significant other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I purchased this product was that it really works. I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos</li>
            <li> I got a tiny free sample of this with a purchase from a bare minerals store. I love their foundations, and used this as an all over moisturizer for my face and neck. I was suprisingly dissapointed when my sample ran out. I didn&#x27;t want to pay $50 for a moisturizer, and I&#x27;m young enough that I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, but I ended up spending well over 50 bucks trying to find a moisturizer that was light, effective on my combination skin (dry and peel in some areas, very oily in others and prone to break outs), and this one was the only one that didn&#x27;t make me greasy, kept me from peeling, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts, helped the ones I had to heal better with less scarring, and I almost shelled out $50 to get it at the store, but thought I should check amazon first. With a prime membership I got it for $40 in two days with free shipping, and my face is finally getting back to normal again. Well.... better than normal, really. Plus, while I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, if nothing else maybe it&#x27;ll be a little bit longer than nature intended before I get them. Winkle or no wrinkles, it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found, and it&#x27;s a nice light and even base for foundation. Worth it&#x27;s weight in gold for problematic skin.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and smell.  I use it twice a day.  Have not seen a difference, but maybe it will just take time.</li>
            <li> A really good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years now and love it.  It&#x27;s light but does a great job moisturizing my skin and minimizing the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This works so well and believe me I try a lot of creams but I love the whole bare minerals line.</li>
            <li> Bareminerals Multi-arinkle serum.&lt;br /&gt;I like it. Use it daily around eyes and neck and forehead to reduce the signs of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but when I received the bottle, the straw thats supposed to be inside the bottle to help dispense the liquid was missing. Seriously? Other than that this product works well. Not too oily, smoothes over the skin nicely and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Love this product and highly recommend to those who purchase BareMineral products.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Smells great and makes your facial skin feel great too!</li>
            <li> Great product but packaging could be better.</li>
            <li> This is a very light, non greasy formula that feels as though nothing is on my skin when the humidity is high.  Perfect for me.  I can keep using products to help with the wrinkles that are creeping in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day over a month in conjunction with the Purely Nourishing Cream. I see no reduction in the fine lines around my eyes however I do have an overall improvement to the tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, leaves my skin looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li> This is an emollient wrinkle softener that works, if you use it religiously. I tried this product because bareMinerals has an extra firming neck cream that has transformed my neck. I am 70 years old an appreciate a skin care line that reverses the signs of aging, not wanting to use fillers or go under the knife. I am grateful to bareMinerals for delivering on their product claims.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after I apply this serum to the target areas (which are mainly my expression lines)! Its got a pleasant smell too...reminds me of lemongrass :)</li>
            <li> A multi-user of this product!  Helps reduce wrinkles and firm skin up.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin care product.  I really like the way it feels and works.  High priced, but it does last quite awhile and is a very nice serum.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF TAKES YEARS OFF!!!</li>
            <li> This product was not the same as my originally purchased Bare Minerals Anti-wrinkle repair. It came without a box, missing a piece of the pump, and was distinctly different in texture and smell. Obviously a grey market item.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work.  I am 30 and have a few fine lines/wrinkles that I hate.  After using this stuff for a week they are significantly less obvious.  However, when I first went to use it, I thought it was defective because I pumped and pumped and nothing came out.  It took about 30 pumps and finally it started coming out.  Doesn&#x27;t seem like very much was in there, I&#x27;ve used it maybe 15-20 times and it seems almost empty.  You don&#x27;t need much though.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample from the Bare Minerals store and used it all up. It is amazing and saw results immediately so I ordered online and saved a trip to the mall. I am 54 and have good skin, but dry and lines are coming in. This makes skin look brighter and more radiant and I use with the purely nourishing cream at night over this. I love it like I love all their products! I am seeing some aging as I get older so I thought since I love the makeup and brushes I will try their skin care and I am impressed.</li>
