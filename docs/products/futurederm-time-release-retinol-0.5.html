    <ol>
            <li>I am happy to have come across this product!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a perfect time to buy.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful retinol that anyone can use.  </li>
            <li>The shipper was great too, they immediately sent the product and it arrived in 3 to 5 days.</li>
            <li>and I have seen great improvements in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Thank you FutureDerm for this amazing product!</li>
            <li>Best of all, I can wear it under my makeup :)</li>
            <li>It has cleared up my breakouts, and the best part about it is that it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product before and had good results when combined with a glycolic acid or obagi product.</li>
            <li>So glad FutureDerm put out this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>FutureDerm Retinol is amazing.</li>
            <li>But I really had to gush about how great FutureDerm&#x27;s retinol product is to start!</li>
            <li>So far, great results!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine lines on my forehead, and I hoped these lines would fade once I started using a retinol product.</li>
            <li>This retinol comes with very detailed instructions, a great pump applicator, and rubs right in.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say strongly enough how wonderful this product is.  </li>
            <li>I am 100% sure these age spots were not there before I started using the Futurederm retinol.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is fragrance-free, which is a must for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks for creating this great product...</li>
            <li>The skin feels smoother and just looks better.</li>
            <li>In the morning, my skin feels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Be sure that you plan to keep the product after the purchase because, in my opinion, you will not be able to get a refund as stated.</li>
            <li>first, I loved this product.</li>
            <li>I am doing a 30 day challenge and I am glad to have FutureDerm -- to smooth out all of the signs of stress (leads to aging) :)</li>
            <li>Even in this state I think i will like the product as it absorbs quickly and has a mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how effective this product is and how great it is for your skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>Being a dedicated reader of the advice and reviews on FutureDerm.com, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try the first of its own products to be released.  </li>
            <li>I have combination/oily acneic skin and follow up usage with a light application of an oil-free moisturizer to minimize irritation.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>I bought this item after reading all of the glowing reviews, and was excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This product will not leave any residue and feels light while applying, soaking in quickly.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me nice and clear!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on special now</li>
            <li>The manufacturer has put so much time into creating this as well as making sure clients understand how it works.</li>
            <li>Also, can&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin feels after putting it on right before bed.</li>
            <li>but then my skin begins looking more vibrant and youthful.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being a skin care newbie, it really helps to know that advice and help is so accessible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a light serum or something to moisturize and make my skin smooth as my 30s are approaching.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>First, it is so lightweight.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sit on top like the traditional retinol creams that I have used.  </li>
            <li>I did experience a bit of peeling at first on my face, but no irritation.</li>
            <li>At first, I was also using it on my neck, and I did get a rash there, so</li>
            <li>This week I&#x27;ve been waking up to smooth, baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>This is the first product from FutureDerm and also my first retinol skincare product.</li>
            <li>Exactly like they recommend, I reduced how often I used it and the irritation went away.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, creamy and absorbs fast!</li>
            <li>The science behind it is incredible, really something new &amp; trendsetting.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product to turn back the clock of aging, fight acne, combat fine lines &amp; wrinkles and improve the appearance of pores then a retinol is a MUST.</li>
            <li>If you are considering the use of this product or any other retinol product, make sure you also use a sunscreen of exceptional quality, because retinol makes your skin more vulnerable to the sun.</li>
            <li>So, I started this product almost 2 weeks ago and the results have been better than expected.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet effective enough to turn back time without burning your face.</li>
            <li>Despite making a difference in the skin&#x27;s feel at first, it has no effect over time on wrinkles and skin firmness; 5) IT MAY CAUSE NEW AGE SPOTS TO APPEAR ON YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li>After following FutureDerm for several months, I was very excited to purchase her first skincare product.</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s more gentle on my skin that previous retinol products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will: over time, with continued use, it made my pores appear smaller, my skin seemed smoother, my acne cleared up tremendously, the two fine lines I have on my face (nasolabial and forehead) faded slightly.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>The product feels good on, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue while I sleep, &amp; you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product a few stars because it does absorb quickly and seems very gentle on the skin (maybe too gentle, though).</li>
            <li>product dries so quickly and smoothly that it hardly impacts my routine.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, combo, and I was just recently diagnosed with mild rosacea.</li>
            <li>After three months of use of the Futurederm retinol, I noticed two NEW age spots close to my eyes.</li>
            <li>I had been using another gentle Retinol Serum with no issue, so after discussing at length with my Dermatologist, I got the green light to try this product.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I used a retinol product, and my skin suddenly felt baby-smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the regimen that I used: At first, I only used it twice a week.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s my first, I&#x27;ve only used it twice because I don&#x27;t want to overwhelm my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;ve been using Future Derm Time Release Retinol 0.5, my skin has never looked better and without all the redness and peeling that the other products caused.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks so far (every other night), but I love it.</li>
            <li>FutureDerm&#x27;s Time Release Retinol is a full strength retinol that releases the active ingredient over an eight hour period.</li>
            <li>I always applied the product at night (after washing my face with Dove Sensitive), and I applied Spectro Dry Skin Moisturizer right after applying the retinol.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, which makes it hard to find products that don&#x27;t make my skin more oily and shinny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple weeks of use, my skin feels noticeably better, though it&#x27;s hard for me to say why.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I did not use the retinol product, and I always applied Olay&#x27;s Sensitive Skin Complete Moisurizing Lotion, SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My pores haven&#x27;t shrunk as much as I would like, but it will likely take longer than two weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I had not used a retinol product before, and I did have some minor irritation on my skin for the first 3 weeks or so.</li>
            <li>I have full trust that this product will live up to its claims of keeping my skin firm and would recommend this product to friends, family and everyone in between.</li>
            <li>I know this because I checked my skin daily from the start of this \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;, almost obsessively, to check if my wrinkles were diminishing (which they were not), and I definitely would have noticed those age spots, which are the first ones to appear on my face (I am 34).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also nice to know that it was developed with such care and that the company (and founder) are completely behind it.</li>
            <li>Mine was just sealed with a white label that has a bar code on it and says new.</li>
            <li>I used Olay&#x27;s Sensitive Skin Complete Moisurizing Lotion, SPF 30, and it did not offer enough protection.</li>
            <li>As a guy I don&#x27;t frequently buy beauty products, but a friend told me about retinoids, how they regenerate skin and how they can help make pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>I have tried to use many retinol products in the past, but had to stop immediately due to irritation.  </li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m only a little over a week in with this product</li>
            <li>I remember noticing a big difference in the first few days of use.</li>

            <li> I remember noticing a big difference in the first few days of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for the past two months, and haven&#x27;t really seen any results.</li>
            <li> Similar (and more expensive) ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past have irritated my sensitive skin, but this does not.</li>
            <li> Since I was worried about sensitivity/dryness, I&#x27;m starting out by using every other day to allow my skin time to adjust to retinol after several years off.</li>
            <li> Second, I have also found it to be less drying because I can apply a moisturizer without waiting also unlike traditional creams.  </li>
            <li> I have used several retinol products with little or no success because of sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and I look forward to the other FutureDerm items in the future.</li>
            <li> It takes time (couple of weeks or a month +) to really see improvements because its subtle.  </li>
            <li> You can actually feel it working after only a few days.  </li>
            <li> My skin especially around my forehead is even less oily.</li>
            <li> but I only had a small patch near the side of my face that had a little peeling and that is it.  </li>
            <li> The product is not readily available - you must order it online, which is not practical; 2) It is expensive compared to similar products from Neutrogena (containing \\&quot;Retinol SA\\&quot;, i.e. sustained-action retinol), which are readily available at the drugstore; 3) It is not recommended for use in the eye area (probably due to its alcohol content), and Futurederm does not offer a retinol eye cream; 4)</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;The seller performed well and the item was delivered as expected.  </li>
            <li> Released Retinol for over a week already with absolutely no sign of irritation!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this every morning and night. I&#x27;ve got no problems with this on my super-sensitive skin. Keeps me nice and clear! Best of all, I can wear it under my makeup :)</li>
            <li> I am happy to have come across this product! It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I am doing a 30 day challenge and I am glad to have FutureDerm -- to smooth out all of the signs of stress (leads to aging) :)</li>
            <li> After following FutureDerm for several months, I was very excited to purchase her first skincare product. This retinol comes with very detailed instructions, a great pump applicator, and rubs right in. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but can already tell that my skin is smoother! I&#x27;m only 23 so I&#x27;m using this product to prevent acne/wrinkles. Since I was worried about sensitivity/dryness, I&#x27;m starting out by using every other day to allow my skin time to adjust to retinol after several years off. I have combination/oily acneic skin and follow up usage with a light application of an oil-free moisturizer to minimize irritation. Thank you Future Derm!</li>
            <li> Being a dedicated reader of the advice and reviews on FutureDerm.com, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try the first of its own products to be released.  I can&#x27;t say strongly enough how wonderful this product is.  It is everything that was promised. First, it is so lightweight.  It instantly absorbs into my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t sit on top like the traditional retinol creams that I have used.  You can actually feel it working after only a few days.  Second, I have also found it to be less drying because I can apply a moisturizer without waiting also unlike traditional creams.  After a few weeks of use, I can see a difference. I will continue to buy this product and I look forward to the other FutureDerm items in the future.</li>
            <li> I received my product promptly and packaging was no nonsense. Unfortunately the product itself seems to have oxidized. It&#x27;s supposed to be a white gel like cream and mine pumped out a neon yellow gel! I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the product should look like. I think I need to return this or get it exchanged. Also, should it have been sealed in plastic? Mine was just sealed with a white label that has a bar code on it and says new. Hmmm I don&#x27;t know what to make of this.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.&lt;br /&gt;The seller performed well and the item was delivered as expected.  However the product itself was defective I believe.  It should have been creamy white and it pumped out neon yellow as though it had oxidized.  Even in this state I think i will like the product as it absorbs quickly and has a mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> If you are considering the use of this product or any other retinol product, make sure you also use a sunscreen of exceptional quality, because retinol makes your skin more vulnerable to the sun. I used Olay&#x27;s Sensitive Skin Complete Moisurizing Lotion, SPF 30, and it did not offer enough protection. After three months of use of the Futurederm retinol, I noticed two NEW age spots close to my eyes. I am 100% sure these age spots were not there before I started using the Futurederm retinol. I know this because I checked my skin daily from the start of this \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;, almost obsessively, to check if my wrinkles were diminishing (which they were not), and I definitely would have noticed those age spots, which are the first ones to appear on my face (I am 34).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I loved this product. I remember noticing a big difference in the first few days of use. It was the first time I used a retinol product, and my skin suddenly felt baby-smooth. Unfortunately, after three months of use, the results were not as dramatic as I had hoped - I saw no difference in my wrinkles, or the overall firmness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the regimen that I used: At first, I only used it twice a week. After a few weeks, I started using the product every other day, and I then used it every day. I always applied the product at night (after washing my face with Dove Sensitive), and I applied Spectro Dry Skin Moisturizer right after applying the retinol. I did experience a bit of peeling at first on my face, but no irritation. At first, I was also using it on my neck, and I did get a rash there, so I used it only on my face from that moment on. In the morning, I did not use the retinol product, and I always applied Olay&#x27;s Sensitive Skin Complete Moisurizing Lotion, SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the product does make your skin glow and feel baby-smooth. I love the fact that it is fragrance-free, which is a must for me. On the negative side, there are five big cons associated with this product in my opinion: 1) The product is not readily available - you must order it online, which is not practical; 2) It is expensive compared to similar products from Neutrogena (containing \\&quot;Retinol SA\\&quot;, i.e. sustained-action retinol), which are readily available at the drugstore; 3) It is not recommended for use in the eye area (probably due to its alcohol content), and Futurederm does not offer a retinol eye cream; 4) Despite making a difference in the skin&#x27;s feel at first, it has no effect over time on wrinkles and skin firmness; 5) IT MAY CAUSE NEW AGE SPOTS TO APPEAR ON YOUR FACE. This last point is a deal-breaker for me. I will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it works great for me. It has cleared up my breakouts, and the best part about it is that it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before and had good results when combined with a glycolic acid or obagi product. It takes time (couple of weeks or a month +) to really see improvements because its subtle.  I use a very small drop and after a few nights of use, some areas around my face (around my nose) will begin to peel and but then my skin begins looking more vibrant and youthful. The shipper was great too, they immediately sent the product and it arrived in 3 to 5 days.</li>
            <li> So glad FutureDerm put out this product! I&#x27;m a regular reader of the blog (futurederm.com) and couldn&#x27;t wait to try their retinol out. Similar (and more expensive) ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past have irritated my sensitive skin, but this does not. Also, can&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin feels after putting it on right before bed. Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now and I have seen great improvements in my skin.  I have never tried a retinol before and I was nervous that it was going to make my face been and stuff before it actually improved my skin (because that is what I hear from everyone) but I only had a small patch near the side of my face that had a little peeling and that is it.  I saw instant improvements to my skin and I am thrilled with this product!  Definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, which makes it hard to find products that don&#x27;t make my skin more oily and shinny. Literally by 5pm I have oil from my forehead running into my eyes. I&#x27;ve been looking for a light serum or something to moisturize and make my skin smooth as my 30s are approaching. So, I started this product almost 2 weeks ago and the results have been better than expected. This week I&#x27;ve been waking up to smooth, baby soft skin. My skin especially around my forehead is even less oily. I haven&#x27;t had any reactions and I use it almost every night now. Thanks for creating this great product...no more expensive, ineffective department store brands for me.</li>
            <li> This time release retinol is making a big difference in my skin even with just three weeks of use. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do as time goes on. The manufacturer has put so much time into creating this as well as making sure clients understand how it works. It&#x27;s on special now so it&#x27;s a perfect time to buy.</li>
            <li> As a guy I don&#x27;t frequently buy beauty products, but a friend told me about retinoids, how they regenerate skin and how they can help make pores look smaller. So I thought I&#x27;d give this a try, and bought it from FutureDerm&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I have something on my face. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple weeks of use, my skin feels noticeably better, though it&#x27;s hard for me to say why. The skin feels smoother and just looks better. My pores haven&#x27;t shrunk as much as I would like, but it will likely take longer than two weeks.</li>
            <li> Really works! I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and this is keeping the wrinkles at bay. I use this once a week in addition to cera ve am/pm lotion and I get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product to turn back the clock of aging, fight acne, combat fine lines &amp; wrinkles and improve the appearance of pores then a retinol is a MUST. FutureDerm&#x27;s Time Release Retinol is a full strength retinol that releases the active ingredient over an eight hour period. I can&#x27;t stress enough how effective this product is and how great it is for your skin. I have been using it for about a week now and am already seeing results. I have full trust that this product will live up to its claims of keeping my skin firm and would recommend this product to friends, family and everyone in between. FutureDerm FTW!</li>
            <li> This is the first product from FutureDerm and also my first retinol skincare product. Since it&#x27;s my first, I&#x27;ve only used it twice because I don&#x27;t want to overwhelm my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product dries so quickly and smoothly that it hardly impacts my routine. I don&#x27;t have to wait around to use my nightly moisturizer and go to bed. In the morning, my skin feels nice and smooth. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens with extended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also nice to know that it was developed with such care and that the company (and founder) are completely behind it. They&#x27;ve already published 2 articles on the website to answer some FAQs. Being a skin care newbie, it really helps to know that advice and help is so accessible.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product through the FutureDerm Store when it was launched on their website. I used it 3-5 times weekly for two months. I had not used a retinol product before, and I did have some minor irritation on my skin for the first 3 weeks or so. Exactly like they recommend, I reduced how often I used it and the irritation went away. This product does exactly what it says it will: over time, with continued use, it made my pores appear smaller, my skin seemed smoother, my acne cleared up tremendously, the two fine lines I have on my face (nasolabial and forehead) faded slightly. I hope they come out with their CE serum and hopefully, a 1% retinol. I 100% recommend this to anyone to try for a couple months.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading all of the glowing reviews, and was excited to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for the past two months, and haven&#x27;t really seen any results. I have a lot of very fine lines on my forehead, and I hoped these lines would fade once I started using a retinol product. Unfortunately, the lines are still there, and they don&#x27;t look any better than they did before. I&#x27;m giving this product a few stars because it does absorb quickly and seems very gentle on the skin (maybe too gentle, though). I&#x27;ll be trying a different retinol next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week &amp; its fab! The science behind it is incredible, really something new &amp; trendsetting. The product feels good on, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue while I sleep, &amp; you only need a small amount. So far, great results!</li>
            <li> I have used several retinol products with little or no success because of sensitive skin.  But since I&#x27;ve been using Future Derm Time Release Retinol 0.5, my skin has never looked better and without all the redness and peeling that the other products caused.  This will be my go to Retinol product from now on!</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try out FutureDerm Time-Release Retinol .5. My skin is sensitive, combo, and I was just recently diagnosed with mild rosacea. I had been using another gentle Retinol Serum with no issue, so after discussing at length with my Dermatologist, I got the green light to try this product. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks so far (every other night), but I love it. I feel like it&#x27;s more gentle on my skin that previous retinol products that I&#x27;ve tried. I think it&#x27;s because of the time-release, since it&#x27;s not all at once, overloading your skin. I&#x27;ll report back after a month. But I really had to gush about how great FutureDerm&#x27;s retinol product is to start! My skin feels softer and smoother already! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried to use many retinol products in the past, but had to stop immediately due to irritation.  I have been using Futurederm&#x27;s Time Released Retinol for over a week already with absolutely no sign of irritation!  It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m only a little over a week in with this product and I&#x27;m already seeing results.  I had a little bit of peeling that only lasted a few days and am noticing improved texture and all-over tone.  I&#x27;m only using it once a day in the evening before I apply my moisturizer.  It&#x27;s also helping with a bit of markings leftover from acne.  This product will not leave any residue and feels light while applying, soaking in quickly.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what this product can do over a longer period of time!</li>
            <li> I have only been using them about a week but can already tell a difference. My face is feeling smoother and has a look of smaller pores and a refinement to it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this 10 stars! I&#x27;ve used Retin-A Micro on and off for a few years but it was way too harsh on my skin. FutureDerm Retinol is amazing. It is gentle, creamy and absorbs fast! One pump will cover my face and neck. After one use, you will see a difference - your skin will appear smoother. Buy this... your skin will thank you!    Read her blog: [...]    Thank you FutureDerm for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful retinol that anyone can use.  It is gentle yet effective enough to turn back time without burning your face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item thinking that if I did not like it, the money-back guarantee would be honored.  Well,  I tried calling and e-mailing a representative to find out if I could, indeed, get a refund if I sent the product back.  To my surprise, the extension number and e-mail address that were given were incorrect.  I purchased the product based on the glowing reviews.  Unfortunately, the retinol did nothing but cause breakouts!  Be sure that you plan to keep the product after the purchase because, in my opinion, you will not be able to get a refund as stated.</li>
