            <li>Some reviewers have commented that the towels stick to your skin more than cotton towels.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely love this product except for the tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The more you wash it,</li>
            <li>We do appreciate more its advantages when we travel.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>Use as gym towel and love it.  </li>
            <li>I gave this towel to my husband for Christmas because I love the one I have.  </li>
            <li>I thought this towel would be more absorbent than it is.  </li>
            <li>When I get to the car, I pull the towel out and just lay it on top of my workout bag</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these microfiber towels.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>

            <li>Still going strong.</li>
            <li>These towels are just fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It is an absolutely fabulous towel.</li>
            <li>importantly, indestructible.  </li>
            <li>A perfect product for your home if you are making the effort to go green.</li>
            <li>This is the best product to buy when you&#x27;re in a rush.. especially in the mornings getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>And it is more absorbent than a regular bath towel by a good margin.  </li>
            <li>Absorbent, dries quickly, washes beautifully, always looks new and reasonably priced!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>The off white is a nice color too!</li>
            <li>Worth EVERY PRICEY PENNY!</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews, I was excited to use it-</li>
            <li>They really do a great job of drying naything you want to dry.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a good local friend who has used one of mine in the past and is so happy!!!</li>
            <li>Feels great on the skin, patting dry so quickly.  </li>
            <li>No rubbing needed, simply pat dry(especially good for woman who will use body creams or oils afterwards).</li>
            <li>Unlike most of the microfiber towels that you see today, this looks more like a suede than a typical towel yet very comfortable to touch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Super absorbent&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Dries much quickly than a terry.  </li>
            <li>He is amazed at how super absorbent it is even though it is so compact.</li>
            <li>Also, it dries quickly which is a  bonus if you swim every day.</li>
            <li>Multi-purposeful and quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love the size and color, better than those smaller hair towels because I have the option to use as a body</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Drying skin is just a quick blotting motion.  </li>
            <li>Quickly wicks water off your body &amp; hair.  </li>
            <li>Towel dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this towel to others.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with purchase &amp; how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to carry and is very absorbent.  </li>
            <li>This is the second Aquis Microfiber towel that I&#x27;ve purchased, I absolutely love them!  </li>
            <li>This towel is very absorbent, it&#x27;s light weight, and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a good first dry off towel for people who are on the pool deck a lot.</li>
            <li>It wont glide on the skin the way a normal cotton plush towel does, but thats easy to get used to and the fact that it does a great job of drying far outweighs the minor inconvenience of getting used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Aquis Body Towel is large, absorbs water quickly both body &amp; hair, and no lint residue.</li>
            <li>The Aquis towels absorb moisture very quickly and they also dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>have owned a few of these towels, in different sizes, and I am always impressed with the quality and the materials.</li>
            <li>It is very absorbent , but then I need a second towel to stay warm</li>
            <li>The microfiber towel quickly became our \\&quot;go to\\&quot; towel because it dries very quickly - which is critical when you have another heat in an hour.</li>
            <li>You can hang them up or put them in the clothes dryer -either way they will dry much more quickly than cotton towels.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem like anything special compared to a normal towel.</li>
            <li>I really like these towels!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be much better than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li>I particularly love this larger bath size.</li>
            <li>I first tried Aquis towels at my Fiancee&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gone when dry.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it since the first wash</li>
            <li>This towel was exactly what I was looking for...light weight, super absorbent, dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t small mildewy, and is a nice large size.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased a few more to take in the RV just to not have huge towels hanging around when I am traveling.</li>
            <li>Just a note, it was strange to use at first because this towel doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly along your skin like most towels do (which kind of makes it necessary for you to pat dry with it).  </li>
            <li>only wish is that they came in sets (bath/hand/washcloth) like traditional towel sets, and were available in more colors, but I&#x27;ll take them anyway</li>
            <li>was mainly interested in a towel that dries you off fast.</li>
            <li>It is also great for travel as it takes up little room in a suitcase and tends to dry quickly spread out on a rack.  </li>
            <li>Not so - enter this large bath towel made of hair-friendly, fast-absorbing microfiber.</li>
            <li>The size of this towel is large enough to wrap around your body comfortably, but I use it as a hair towel.</li>
            <li>I like to have my own towel when I travel, because sometimes hotel towels have too much or too little fabric softener.</li>
            <li>30 years ago a Japanese mill with whom I was doing business, gave me this fabulous towel.</li>
            <li>Really a marvel and so heatlhy for your hair.</li>
            <li>So I bought her the whole body towel for Christmas.</li>
            <li>This towel is quite thin, and great for packing in a workout bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, A+!</li>
            <li>I really like this towel/fiber.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my curls-</li>
            <li>Took it to the salon to show my stylist how much time he could save using microfiber vs. cotton.  </li>
            <li>Very absorbent&lt;br /&gt;Besides</li>
            <li>The towels are very light, but extremely absorbent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one because it is so large.</li>
            <li>This is one of those rare products that actually does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>The are very soft and large.</li>
            <li>I use this towel to dry my hair--it does a fabulous job.  </li>
            <li>This towel takes less space than the camping towels sold in specialty stores and works better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the hair towel for years and was pleased enough with it to get the larger, bath towel.  </li>
            <li>Had many tea stains on it and got washed in sinks frequently.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>We would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight which is so much better than the heavy gram towels that stay damp till the next day, and feel hot especially during the summer months.</li>
            <li>It packs efficiently in the suitcase compared to an ordinary towel, it&#x27;s well constructed, is so absorbent that it dries in a couple of hours (great for frequent hotel changes) and actually stayed clean longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>It had to last me 6 months which it pretty much did.</li>
            <li>VERY absorbent and large enough to cover his body when desired.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered new bath size for my longer hair.  </li>
            <li>We purchased a similar towel (and paid much more) at a swim meet because the towels we brought were all wet by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a towel that would dry me quickly and this towel did just that.  </li>
            <li>This towel is lightweight and quick to dry him off.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight and absorbs water well but still very soft.</li>
            <li>I got a small one as a gift years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth purchasing, also great for traveling, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Sticks too much to my skin to use it to dry my body, so I just use it to wrap my head and leave on while I get ready for the day.  </li>
            <li>Very light&lt;br /&gt;- Not as bulky as a regular towel</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s most delicate -</li>
            <li>I have had the smaller version of this towel for 10-12 years and it has been all over the world, it does not take up much room, dries you efficiently</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t take much room, nor weight in a gym bag and will last for years of continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They make my old bulky towels seem obsolete.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and it is lasting very well.  </li>
            <li>The microfiber air-dries (between showers) and machine-dries far faster than cotton.  </li>
            <li>I would really recommend the smaller hair towel</li>
            <li>The towel kind of drags on your skin when you use it, which is slightly irritating.  </li>
            <li>It does take a bit of getting used to when you first dry off.</li>
            <li>Also, a word of caution if you dye your hair- the first day I used mine was three days and two shampoos after a color session, and it still sucked some color out of my hair, so now my white towel is stained with red.  </li>
            <li>They dry you off fast, they dry quickly when hanging on a rack or hook, and they actually stay wrapped around you.  </li>
            <li>This towel is definitely nice and thin and soft- much softer than I expected, after having used my mom&#x27;s versions of stuff like this years ago when I still lived at home.  </li>
            <li>If you have long hair and wrap your head it this towel, you won&#x27;t believe how much moisture it pulls out.</li>
            <li>I assume in time if the towel is durable enough, it could be worth the price, but only time will tell that, as I have only had my towel for a couple weeks now.</li>
            <li>They also dry rather quickly after use, so you don&#x27;t have to really worry about any of the ickiness that usually comes along with soggy, damp towels.  </li>
            <li>I bought the large size to use for my hair - only because the smaller towel is just a tiny bit skimpy.</li>
            <li>It will help prevent damage to your hair in two ways: the soft microfiber material snags hair much less than regular terry cloth towels and the fact that you&#x27;re seeping so much more water out of your hair before you even begin the blow-dry process means less heat damage.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really speed up drying time, although, when it does finally get dry, it&#x27;s maybe not quite as frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would work better at drying my thick, curly hair that takes all day to dry.  </li>
            <li>I live in Thailand and we shower 3 times a day and this towel is always dry!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine the smaller one would be anywhere near big enough to cover all my hair.</li>
            <li>They last far longer than terry towels, and dry much quicker in a dryer than other towels.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to wash with dark colors; ours absorbed colors from our darker clothes.  </li>
            <li>You need only pat your self dry with none of the old buffing and swiping involved.</li>

            <li> I gave this towel to my husband for Christmas because I love the one I have.  </li>
            <li> I thought this towel would be more absorbent than it is.  </li>
            <li> When I get to the car, I pull the towel out and just lay it on top of my workout bag</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE these microfiber towels.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fantastic and hold up well!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> He likes how easily it fits into his gym bag.</li>
            <li> Still going strong.</li>
            <li> These towels are just fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It is an absolutely fabulous towel.</li>
            <li> importantly, indestructible.  </li>
            <li> A perfect product for your home if you are making the effort to go green.</li>
            <li> This is the best product to buy when you&#x27;re in a rush.. especially in the mornings getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> And it is more absorbent than a regular bath towel by a good margin.  </li>
            <li> Absorbent, dries quickly, washes beautifully, always looks new and reasonably priced!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> The off white is a nice color too!</li>
            <li> Worth EVERY PRICEY PENNY!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I was excited to use it-</li>
            <li> They really do a great job of drying naything you want to dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a good local friend who has used one of mine in the past and is so happy!!!</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin, patting dry so quickly.  </li>
            <li> No rubbing needed, simply pat dry(especially good for woman who will use body creams or oils afterwards).</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the microfiber towels that you see today, this looks more like a suede than a typical towel yet very comfortable to touch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Super absorbent&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Dries much quickly than a terry.  </li>
            <li> He is amazed at how super absorbent it is even though it is so compact.</li>
            <li> Also, it dries quickly which is a  bonus if you swim every day.</li>
            <li> Multi-purposeful and quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love the size and color, better than those smaller hair towels because I have the option to use as a body</li>
            <li> and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Drying skin is just a quick blotting motion.  </li>
            <li> Quickly wicks water off your body &amp; hair.  </li>
            <li> Towel dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this towel to others.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with purchase &amp; how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to carry and is very absorbent.  </li>
            <li> This is the second Aquis Microfiber towel that I&#x27;ve purchased, I absolutely love them!  </li>
            <li> This towel is very absorbent, it&#x27;s light weight, and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a good first dry off towel for people who are on the pool deck a lot.</li>
            <li> It wont glide on the skin the way a normal cotton plush towel does, but thats easy to get used to and the fact that it does a great job of drying far outweighs the minor inconvenience of getting used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Aquis Body Towel is large, absorbs water quickly both body &amp; hair, and no lint residue.</li>
            <li> The Aquis towels absorb moisture very quickly and they also dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> have owned a few of these towels, in different sizes, and I am always impressed with the quality and the materials.</li>
            <li> It is very absorbent , but then I need a second towel to stay warm</li>
            <li> The microfiber towel quickly became our \\&quot;go to\\&quot; towel because it dries very quickly - which is critical when you have another heat in an hour.</li>
            <li> You can hang them up or put them in the clothes dryer -either way they will dry much more quickly than cotton towels.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem like anything special compared to a normal towel.</li>
            <li> I really like these towels!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be much better than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li> I particularly love this larger bath size.</li>
            <li> I first tried Aquis towels at my Fiancee&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gone when dry.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it since the first wash</li>
            <li> This towel was exactly what I was looking for...light weight, super absorbent, dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t small mildewy, and is a nice large size.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased a few more to take in the RV just to not have huge towels hanging around when I am traveling.</li>
            <li> Just a note, it was strange to use at first because this towel doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly along your skin like most towels do (which kind of makes it necessary for you to pat dry with it).  </li>
            <li> only wish is that they came in sets (bath/hand/washcloth) like traditional towel sets, and were available in more colors, but I&#x27;ll take them anyway</li>
            <li> was mainly interested in a towel that dries you off fast.</li>
            <li> It is also great for travel as it takes up little room in a suitcase and tends to dry quickly spread out on a rack.  </li>
            <li> Not so - enter this large bath towel made of hair-friendly, fast-absorbing microfiber.</li>
            <li> The size of this towel is large enough to wrap around your body comfortably, but I use it as a hair towel.</li>
            <li> I like to have my own towel when I travel, because sometimes hotel towels have too much or too little fabric softener.</li>
            <li> 30 years ago a Japanese mill with whom I was doing business, gave me this fabulous towel.</li>
            <li> Really a marvel and so heatlhy for your hair.</li>
            <li> So I bought her the whole body towel for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This towel is quite thin, and great for packing in a workout bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, A+!</li>
            <li> I really like this towel/fiber.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my curls-</li>
            <li> Took it to the salon to show my stylist how much time he could save using microfiber vs. cotton.  </li>
            <li> Very absorbent&lt;br /&gt;Besides</li>
            <li> The towels are very light, but extremely absorbent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one because it is so large.</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare products that actually does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> The are very soft and large.</li>
            <li> I use this towel to dry my hair--it does a fabulous job.  </li>
            <li> This towel takes less space than the camping towels sold in specialty stores and works better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the hair towel for years and was pleased enough with it to get the larger, bath towel.  </li>
            <li> Had many tea stains on it and got washed in sinks frequently.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight which is so much better than the heavy gram towels that stay damp till the next day, and feel hot especially during the summer months.</li>
            <li> It packs efficiently in the suitcase compared to an ordinary towel, it&#x27;s well constructed, is so absorbent that it dries in a couple of hours (great for frequent hotel changes) and actually stayed clean longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> It had to last me 6 months which it pretty much did.</li>
            <li> VERY absorbent and large enough to cover his body when desired.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered new bath size for my longer hair.  </li>
            <li> We purchased a similar towel (and paid much more) at a swim meet because the towels we brought were all wet by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a towel that would dry me quickly and this towel did just that.  </li>
            <li> This towel is lightweight and quick to dry him off.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight and absorbs water well but still very soft.</li>
            <li> I got a small one as a gift years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth purchasing, also great for traveling, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sticks too much to my skin to use it to dry my body, so I just use it to wrap my head and leave on while I get ready for the day.  </li>
            <li> Very light&lt;br /&gt;- Not as bulky as a regular towel</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s most delicate -</li>
            <li> I have had the smaller version of this towel for 10-12 years and it has been all over the world, it does not take up much room, dries you efficiently</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t take much room, nor weight in a gym bag and will last for years of continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They make my old bulky towels seem obsolete.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and it is lasting very well.  </li>
            <li> The microfiber air-dries (between showers) and machine-dries far faster than cotton.  </li>
            <li> I would really recommend the smaller hair towel</li>
            <li> The towel kind of drags on your skin when you use it, which is slightly irritating.  </li>
            <li> It does take a bit of getting used to when you first dry off.</li>
            <li> Also, a word of caution if you dye your hair- the first day I used mine was three days and two shampoos after a color session, and it still sucked some color out of my hair, so now my white towel is stained with red.  </li>
            <li> They dry you off fast, they dry quickly when hanging on a rack or hook, and they actually stay wrapped around you.  </li>
            <li> This towel is definitely nice and thin and soft- much softer than I expected, after having used my mom&#x27;s versions of stuff like this years ago when I still lived at home.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair and wrap your head it this towel, you won&#x27;t believe how much moisture it pulls out.</li>
            <li> I assume in time if the towel is durable enough, it could be worth the price, but only time will tell that, as I have only had my towel for a couple weeks now.</li>
            <li> They also dry rather quickly after use, so you don&#x27;t have to really worry about any of the ickiness that usually comes along with soggy, damp towels.  </li>
            <li> I bought the large size to use for my hair - only because the smaller towel is just a tiny bit skimpy.</li>
            <li> It will help prevent damage to your hair in two ways: the soft microfiber material snags hair much less than regular terry cloth towels and the fact that you&#x27;re seeping so much more water out of your hair before you even begin the blow-dry process means less heat damage.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really speed up drying time, although, when it does finally get dry, it&#x27;s maybe not quite as frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would work better at drying my thick, curly hair that takes all day to dry.  </li>
            <li> I live in Thailand and we shower 3 times a day and this towel is always dry!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine the smaller one would be anywhere near big enough to cover all my hair.</li>
            <li> They last far longer than terry towels, and dry much quicker in a dryer than other towels.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to wash with dark colors; ours absorbed colors from our darker clothes.  </li>
            <li> You need only pat your self dry with none of the old buffing and swiping involved.</li>
            <li> It normally takes me about 10-15 minutes to get my hair dry (using a blow dryer), but if I pull my hair up into this towel, it can cut that time down to under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair as much as possible so I don&#x27;t need to use the blow dryer on it long, therefore, saving my hair from the harmful dryer.</li>
            <li> I now use this larger size for my hair towel, because the smaller one took a long time to dry when I grew my hair out.</li>
            <li> Now we only bring 2 microfiber towels to each meet and they are almost completely dry when we need them again.  </li>
            <li> If I were to do this with a regular towel, the towel wouldnt be completely dry and would start smeling funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually use this towel to roll my just hand washed clothes in to help them dry faster when traveling.  </li>
            <li> I have hip length hair, and I used to use a regular towel to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Pat yourself dry in a second!</li>
            <li> Also packs in far less space if you travel with it.  </li>
            <li> The one I owned was about 36\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have used Aquis towels on my hair for years.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t yet know how this will wear over the long haul, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it even if I have to replace it oftener.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my waste -- and wrapped it up while I was getting ready, and didn&#x27;t even need to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> When I pull my hair out, it is dryer than with a regular towel, although I do still have to hit it with the blow dryer for a little bit to get it dry enough to my liking to leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe my expensive front-loading washer doesn&#x27;t clean as well as it should.  </li>
            <li> I thought my hair would be somewhat dry after using it, and that is not the case.  </li>
            <li> use this towel to dry off after workouts at the gym.</li>
            <li> By morning the towel is completely dry and not musty at all.</li>
            <li> The hair will be damp, and from there it&#x27;s a breeze to air dry.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ve been a little on the frizzy side since I&#x27;ve started using this towel, which I can fix with a little hair serum, but it&#x27;s something I didn&#x27;t so much need to do with other towels and a diffuser attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my cotton towels get wet they take forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> A bit weird at first but not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> I use these for gym towels since they take up so much less space than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li> Those big fluffy towels take a lot of dryer time &amp; electricity to dry.</li>
            <li> The only negative is it doesn&#x27;t stay so white when it comes out of the wash.  </li>
            <li> The time needed under the damaging effects of the hair dryer is now minimal and the styling of my \\&quot;DO\\&quot; is not effected.</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> It also dried completly by the next time I needed to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both towels for about two months and don&#x27;t miss big fluffy cotton towels a bit.  </li>
            <li> - I went with the bigger towel as I have past shoulder-length hair, but this is a little too big.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that&#x27;s really long, about halfway down my back, and takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> I typically do is after I workout and shower and dry off, I throw the towel in my workout bag when I head out to the car.</li>
            <li> These Aquis Microfiber Towels hang dry completely in less than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> After watching the Olympic swimmers use these tiny microfiber towels,  I got a small one for my hair.</li>
            <li> it is extremely absorbent, and does not have any odors or lint issues.  </li>
            <li> It is not soft and cozy but it does the job.</li>
            <li> And if your hair is much past your shoulders, you&#x27;re going to want the big one-</li>
            <li> Even if you just hang it on the rack, it will dry in just a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may also need to be dried by itself to completely dry.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble using big, heavy towels.</li>
            <li> Merely touch this to your skin and it acts like a shammy cloth, quickly absorbing water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Where I&#x27;d used to get out of the shower, wrap my hair up, do my makeup, and then have to take the towel off to blow dry my hair before getting dressed, this towel is thin enough that I can leave it on while I&#x27;m getting dressed because it doesn&#x27;t overstretch the necks of my tops.  </li>
            <li> for hair and body we bought on just for wiping down shower tile walls and glass doors.</li>
            <li> Small enough to pack in a small bag, drag to hostels, and use in rooms for everyday use/spills.</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong with this purchase - I can&#x27;t live without these towels!</li>
            <li> Dries in no time and leaves me less blowdrying to do.</li>
            <li> it leaves a residue or coating on the fabric, and makes them less absorbent.</li>
            <li> It also develops less between-laundering odor than cotton.  </li>
            <li> For someone with thick, long hair, this is a MUST-HAVE.</li>
            <li> but my daughter has very long thick hair</li>
            <li> I guess my hair is a little drier when using this, but not like I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> wife&#x27;s reluctant to use it just because it&#x27;s so thin and unlike traditional body towels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less luggage to lug!</li>
            <li> and it dries so quickly, no chance of that musty smell that thick towels can get during the humid season.  </li>
            <li> But secretly, I use it to dry my cat after his weekly bath.</li>
            <li> so it takes up very little space in the washer and</li>
            <li> Only drawback for me is a tolerable slightly unpleasant odor when the towel was wet.</li>
            <li> Small and portable.  </li>
            <li> When I am done working for the day and head home, I usually hang it up when I get home in the bathroom or on a coat hook.</li>
            <li> (My hair is about 9 inches past my shoulders, for a reference point.)</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t usually go for pricey towels, but this was a gift.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit small.</li>
            <li> These towels are very thin and lightweight, but are insanely absorbent and will get you dry in a flash (and all you have to do is pat dry very gently to accomplish this, there&#x27;s no need for any harsh continual rubbing of your skin with this towel).  </li>
            <li> It is thin, not bulkly at all, so doesn&#x27;t fall down.</li>
            <li> I prefer thick luxurious towels.</li>
            <li> If you are considering this product, hestiate no more!</li>
            <li> This towel is a bit thin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- expensive</li>
            <li> It is very thin, though, which is space saving when folding it up.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Handy towel because it is compact and still absorbent. I like to have my own towel when I travel, because sometimes hotel towels have too much or too little fabric softener. It is also a good towel. It does get dingy, and you&#x27;re not supposed to bleach it.</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare products that actually does exactly what it claims. Use this towel to blot the water out of your hair. It will help prevent damage to your hair in two ways: the soft microfiber material snags hair much less than regular terry cloth towels and the fact that you&#x27;re seeping so much more water out of your hair before you even begin the blow-dry process means less heat damage. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We purchased a similar towel (and paid much more) at a swim meet because the towels we brought were all wet by the end of the day. The microfiber towel quickly became our \\&quot;go to\\&quot; towel because it dries very quickly - which is critical when you have another heat in an hour. Now we only bring 2 microfiber towels to each meet and they are almost completely dry when we need them again.  I highly recommend this one because it is so large.</li>
            <li> This towel was exactly what I was looking for...light weight, super absorbent, dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t small mildewy, and is a nice large size.  I may buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love this towel since it is so light and dries so nice.  I have the hair towel size and the larger bath towel size.  Both are great. Feels great on the skin, patting dry so quickly.  Hang it on the towel bar and it dries so quickly, no chance of that musty smell that thick towels can get during the humid season.  The only negative is it doesn&#x27;t stay so white when it comes out of the wash.  Maybe my expensive front-loading washer doesn&#x27;t clean as well as it should.  Love the towel and I wish I could afford to replace it every time it becomes unsightly dingy.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these and gave to friends. They commented it is the best towel they&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s great benefit is you can towel off with it and then wear it around securely until you get dressed or while you are applying your makeup.  It is thin, not bulkly at all, so doesn&#x27;t fall down.</li>
            <li> I love the Aquis microfiber towels.  When my cotton towels get wet they take forever to dry.  The Aquis towels absorb moisture very quickly and they also dry very quickly. You can hang them up or put them in the clothes dryer -either way they will dry much more quickly than cotton towels.  Some reviewers have commented that the towels stick to your skin more than cotton towels.  I find that these towels are very effective if you pat rather than rub your skin with the them.</li>
            <li> Lightweight to carry to a public pool. But secretly, I use it to dry my cat after his weekly bath.</li>
            <li> 30 years ago a Japanese mill with whom I was doing business, gave me this fabulous towel. It was nothing short of revolutionary. Of course I had to discard my beloved towel many years ago and was DELIGHTED to find this product again on AMAZON. I bought the large size to use for my hair - only because the smaller towel is just a tiny bit skimpy. It litereally drinks the water from hair. The time needed under the damaging effects of the hair dryer is now minimal and the styling of my \\&quot;DO\\&quot; is not effected. Really a marvel and so heatlhy for your hair. If you are considering this product, hestiate no more!</li>
            <li> I really like these towels! The are very soft and large. The off white is a nice color too!</li>
            <li> These towels are just fabulous.  They dry you off fast, they dry quickly when hanging on a rack or hook, and they actually stay wrapped around you.  They are also surprisingly warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that they came in sets (bath/hand/washcloth) like traditional towel sets, and were available in more colors, but I&#x27;ll take them anyway I can get them.</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the microfiber towels that you see today, this looks more like a suede than a typical towel yet very comfortable to touch. It comes with its own zippered pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love this product except for the tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Super absorbent&lt;br /&gt;- The more you wash it, the softer it gets.&lt;br /&gt;- Small and portable.  We do appreciate more its advantages when we travel.&lt;br /&gt;- Well made, quality and amazing detail.&lt;br /&gt;- Very light&lt;br /&gt;- Not as bulky as a regular towel so it takes up very little space in the washer and in your luggage&lt;br /&gt;- Dries much quickly than a terry.  Even if you just hang it on the rack, it will dry in just a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- expensive</li>
            <li> I use this towel to dry my hair--it does a fabulous job.  Dries in no time and leaves me less blowdrying to do. It is also great for travel as it takes up little room in a suitcase and tends to dry quickly spread out on a rack.  I would recommend a different color than white for travel however, so the hotel housekeepers don&#x27;t bundle it up with the hotel&#x27;s towels.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  It does what it claims.  Be careful not to wash with dark colors; ours absorbed colors from our darker clothes.  It may also need to be dried by itself to completely dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the hair towel for years and was pleased enough with it to get the larger, bath towel.  I was having trouble using big, heavy towels. This towel is very absorbent, it&#x27;s light weight, and it dries quickly.  What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> This is a body towel but my daughter has very long thick hair so it works perfectly on it.  She loves it and it definitely helps with the drying process.  We would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and absorbs water well but still very soft. Use as gym towel and love it.  Reordered already.</li>
            <li> I gave this towel to my husband for Christmas because I love the one I have.  He is thrilled!  He is amazed at how super absorbent it is even though it is so compact. He likes how easily it fits into his gym bag.</li>
            <li> Aquis towels, whether for body or hair, are amazing.  It cuts the drying time for my hair by 50% reducing damage from blowdrying.  You will not go wrong with this purchase - I can&#x27;t live without these towels!</li>
            <li> I live in Thailand and we shower 3 times a day and this towel is always dry!  It is perfect for travel and easy to hand wash.  I bought this as a gift for a good local friend who has used one of mine in the past and is so happy!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these hair towels for year that I got as a gift. Still going strong. Noticed recently that teenage daughter was borrowing it a lot. So I bought her the whole body towel for Christmas. She&#x27;s thrilled. It&#x27;s the only one she uses now.</li>
            <li> I thought this towel would be more absorbent than it is.  I thought my hair would be somewhat dry after using it, and that is not the case.  The towel kind of drags on your skin when you use it, which is slightly irritating.  I guess my hair is a little drier when using this, but not like I thought it would be.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be much better than a regular towel.  It is very thin, though, which is space saving when folding it up.</li>
            <li> This is the best product to buy when you&#x27;re in a rush.. especially in the mornings getting ready for work. The Aquis Body Towel is large, absorbs water quickly both body &amp; hair, and no lint residue. No rubbing needed, simply pat dry(especially good for woman who will use body creams or oils afterwards). The towel itself dries in a short period of time, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about having a damp towel later in the day. It&#x27;s light weight which is so much better than the heavy gram towels that stay damp till the next day, and feel hot especially during the summer months. It&#x27;s worth purchasing, also great for traveling, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After watching the Olympic swimmers use these tiny microfiber towels,  I got a small one for my hair. After using it, I bought the larger one for the shower. I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without these towels!</li>
            <li> This towel is quite thin, and great for packing in a workout bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this towel to dry off after workouts at the gym. its so nice to have a non-bulky towel that dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I typically do is after I workout and shower and dry off, I throw the towel in my workout bag when I head out to the car. When I get to the car, I pull the towel out and just lay it on top of my workout bag (I havent ever hung it up in the car). Keep in mind, this is December/January and so the heat in the car when I am in the office is nil. When I am done working for the day and head home, I usually hang it up when I get home in the bathroom or on a coat hook. By morning the towel is completely dry and not musty at all. If I were to do this with a regular towel, the towel wouldnt be completely dry and would start smeling funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned a few of these towels, in different sizes, and I am always impressed with the quality and the materials. It does take a bit of getting used to when you first dry off. It wont glide on the skin the way a normal cotton plush towel does, but thats easy to get used to and the fact that it does a great job of drying far outweighs the minor inconvenience of getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that I highly recommend this product. I have purchased a few more to take in the RV just to not have huge towels hanging around when I am traveling. No doubt they will work well.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to use on a recent trip to Greece.  It is an absolutely fabulous towel. It packs efficiently in the suitcase compared to an ordinary towel, it&#x27;s well constructed, is so absorbent that it dries in a couple of hours (great for frequent hotel changes) and actually stayed clean longer than I expected. I&#x27;d like to have a hundred of them to use at home. I bought this one online because my local retailers no longer carry Aquis towels. I particularly love this larger bath size. The one I owned was about 36\\&quot; long. Worth EVERY PRICEY PENNY!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have used Aquis towels on my hair for years.  My were wearing out so I ordered new bath size for my longer hair.  They are so absorbent and kind to my hair I always take one when I travel.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I washed this towel - without bleach, only OxiClean, and without fabric softener.  Then my husband tried it out.  It&#x27;s great!  VERY absorbent and large enough to cover his body when desired.  We plan to take it camping with us when we need the size and absorbency as well as packing efficiency.</li>
            <li> I actually use this towel to roll my just hand washed clothes in to help them dry faster when traveling.  I can get by with just a couple of changes of clothing this way.  Less luggage to lug!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the size of the towel it is extremely absorbent, and does not have any odors or lint issues.  I am happy with the purchase but do think the price is a bit out of range for the product, so I deducted a star for that. I assume in time if the towel is durable enough, it could be worth the price, but only time will tell that, as I have only had my towel for a couple weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have hip length hair, and I used to use a regular towel to dry my hair. Wrap it up in a turban, and it&#x27;s good to go. I&#x27;ve looked at the \\&quot;Turbie-Twist\\&quot; things in stores and online, but they are too short for my hair, so I thought I was stuck with my regular bath towel. Not so - enter this large bath towel made of hair-friendly, fast-absorbing microfiber. I&#x27;m very happy with it. It is smoother than a regular terrycloth towel, so it doesn&#x27;t catch and pull the hair when it is at it&#x27;s most delicate - when it&#x27;s wet. Just bend at the waist, wrap it around the hair, tuck it in somewhere, and sit around for ten minutes or so. The hair will be damp, and from there it&#x27;s a breeze to air dry.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair as much as possible so I don&#x27;t need to use the blow dryer on it long, therefore, saving my hair from the harmful dryer.</li>
            <li> It was a gift to a friend who swims.  I&#x27;ve been using one for years (although not this big one) and I love it.  It&#x27;s easy to carry and is very absorbent.  I have one for my hair and one for my body.  Also, it dries quickly which is a  bonus if you swim every day.</li>
            <li> Love these towels! Tried them at a friend&#x27;s place, and fell in love! Pat yourself dry in a second! I have hair down to my waste -- and wrapped it up while I was getting ready, and didn&#x27;t even need to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The size of this towel is large enough to wrap around your body comfortably, but I use it as a hair towel. Multi-purposeful and quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the size and color, better than those smaller hair towels because I have the option to use as a body towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had the smaller version of this towel for 10-12 years and it has been all over the world, it does not take up much room, dries you efficiently and it dries quickly. I use it for swimming when I am on holiday and bathing on camping trips. This towel takes less space than the camping towels sold in specialty stores and works better in my opinion. The one caveat is that it does have a tendency to stain, but I am not using it in a home bathroom. Needless to say, I must be satisfied since I bought the larger one.</li>
            <li> This review is geared toward gym goers because this towel is awesome for the gym.  It&#x27;s lightweight, compact and a great towel for the sauna and shower.  Merely touch this to your skin and it acts like a shammy cloth, quickly absorbing water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And importantly, indestructible.  Though lightweight, these things are rugged.  They don&#x27;t take much room, nor weight in a gym bag and will last for years of continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> I just adore the texture of the microfiber! I am a tactilely hypersensitive individual. It even works for cleaning of after my 2 daily showers! Might need to get a second one for daily regular cuddling. Simply everything I&#x27;ve wanted in a towel for years.</li>
            <li> I have used Aquis towels for years.  Don&#x27;t like using anything else.  They last far longer than terry towels, and dry much quicker in a dryer than other towels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of changing to these bath towels exclusively. They make my old bulky towels seem obsolete. Love them! Wish they made wash cloths to match.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a towel that would dry me quickly and this towel did just that.  It also dried completly by the next time I needed to use it.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to get out of the bathroom faster.  It is not soft and cozy but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This is the second Aquis Microfiber towel that I&#x27;ve purchased, I absolutely love them!  These towels are very thin and lightweight, but are insanely absorbent and will get you dry in a flash (and all you have to do is pat dry very gently to accomplish this, there&#x27;s no need for any harsh continual rubbing of your skin with this towel).  Because of this, they&#x27;re way gentler on skin and hair.  They also dry rather quickly after use, so you don&#x27;t have to really worry about any of the ickiness that usually comes along with soggy, damp towels.  Just a note, it was strange to use at first because this towel doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly along your skin like most towels do (which kind of makes it necessary for you to pat dry with it).  It sort of sticks to you or grips you, if that makes sense.  A bit weird at first but not a big deal.  I love these towels and will not use anything else for my skin/hair again!  Highly recommend, A+!</li>
            <li> This is a good first dry off towel for people who are on the pool deck a lot. It is very absorbent , but then I need a second towel to stay warm</li>
            <li> I really like this towel/fiber. Where have you been all my life?  If you&#x27;ve never used one of these microfiber towels, here&#x27;s how it works. You need only pat your self dry with none of the old buffing and swiping involved. If you have long hair and wrap your head it this towel, you won&#x27;t believe how much moisture it pulls out. After use, hang it up and it dries in no time.</li>
            <li> Arrived just as promised.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these microfiber towels. I got a small one as a gift years ago and fell in love with it. I now use this larger size for my hair towel, because the smaller one took a long time to dry when I grew my hair out. (My hair is about 9 inches past my shoulders, for a reference point.) For someone with thick, long hair, this is a MUST-HAVE. It normally takes me about 10-15 minutes to get my hair dry (using a blow dryer), but if I pull my hair up into this towel, it can cut that time down to under 5 minutes. I also have a smaller version of this towel, and I use that for travel, or when this larger one is in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this towel almost 2 years and it&#x27;s still in good shape. **Remember, do NOT use fabric softener or dryer sheets when you wash your towels - it leaves a residue or coating on the fabric, and makes them less absorbent.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t usually go for pricey towels, but this was a gift.  After reading all the reviews, I was excited to use it- I have thick curly hair that&#x27;s really long, about halfway down my back, and takes forever to dry.  This towel is definitely nice and thin and soft- much softer than I expected, after having used my mom&#x27;s versions of stuff like this years ago when I still lived at home.  And it is more absorbent than a regular bath towel by a good margin.  Where I&#x27;d used to get out of the shower, wrap my hair up, do my makeup, and then have to take the towel off to blow dry my hair before getting dressed, this towel is thin enough that I can leave it on while I&#x27;m getting dressed because it doesn&#x27;t overstretch the necks of my tops.  When I pull my hair out, it is dryer than with a regular towel, although I do still have to hit it with the blow dryer for a little bit to get it dry enough to my liking to leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my curls- they&#x27;ve been a little on the frizzy side since I&#x27;ve started using this towel, which I can fix with a little hair serum, but it&#x27;s something I didn&#x27;t so much need to do with other towels and a diffuser attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this product save me time? Yes.  Is it a miracle product? No.  I like it and I&#x27;ll continue using it, but I doubt I&#x27;ll buy another.  Also, a word of caution if you dye your hair- the first day I used mine was three days and two shampoos after a color session, and it still sucked some color out of my hair, so now my white towel is stained with red.  This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me because I don&#x27;t really care what the towel looks like, but just something to know if you&#x27;re a dye-er, use regular towels for a few shampoos after you dye.  And if your hair is much past your shoulders, you&#x27;re going to want the big one- I can&#x27;t imagine the smaller one would be anywhere near big enough to cover all my hair.</li>
            <li> Best towels ever made!  Absorbent, dries quickly, washes beautifully, always looks new and reasonably priced!&lt;br /&gt;Only towels we ever use.  The best investment you can make.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.  LL</li>
            <li> A perfect product for your home if you are making the effort to go green. Those big fluffy towels take a lot of dryer time &amp; electricity to dry. These Aquis Microfiber Towels hang dry completely in less than 3 hours. We use nothing else.</li>
            <li> I first tried Aquis towels at my Fiancee&#x27;s house. The towels are very light, but extremely absorbent. They really do a great job of drying naything you want to dry. These towels are great.</li>
            <li> Love microfiber and have found this brand to be very good.  However, I want to rub my back with the towel and this just stays in one place and soaks up the water.  My daughter-in-law loved that so it is hers now.  I&#x27;ll just stick with the hair towel.</li>
            <li> I use these for gym towels since they take up so much less space than a regular towel.  They&#x27;re fantastic and hold up well!</li>
            <li> I used this to travel in Europe and the UK.  It had to last me 6 months which it pretty much did. It got a lot of use and abuse.  Had many tea stains on it and got washed in sinks frequently. Through it all, it kept its shape and absorbency. Small enough to pack in a small bag, drag to hostels, and use in rooms for everyday use/spills. Loved this towel.</li>
            <li> And so light, perfect for travelling light!  I use it all the time and it is lasting very well.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Only drawback for me is a tolerable slightly unpleasant odor when the towel was wet. It&#x27;s gone when dry.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it since the first wash so maybe it will not come back.&lt;br /&gt;I was mainly interested in a towel that dries you off fast. And it does.&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s reluctant to use it just because it&#x27;s so thin and unlike traditional body towels.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m a believer, now.</li>
            <li> I use this for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Bought on recommendation from a friend.  Absolutely love it.  Took it to the salon to show my stylist how much time he could save using microfiber vs. cotton.  He was impressed.  I also bought the Aquis hair-sized towel and it&#x27;s wonderful also.  Drying skin is just a quick blotting motion.  I&#x27;ve been using both towels for about two months and don&#x27;t miss big fluffy cotton towels a bit.  The microfiber air-dries (between showers) and machine-dries far faster than cotton.  Saves time, electricity and dryer sheets. It also develops less between-laundering odor than cotton.  Also packs in far less space if you travel with it.  Don&#x27;t yet know how this will wear over the long haul, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it even if I have to replace it oftener.</li>
            <li> This towel is a bit thin. I prefer thick luxurious towels. It&#x27;s also a bit small. I can&#x27;t fault them for that since I knew the size when I was getting it. It just doesn&#x27;t seem like anything special compared to a normal towel.</li>
            <li> This towel felt good &amp; works well.  Quickly wicks water off your body &amp; hair.  The price &amp; quality is very good.  Towel dries quickly.  I would recommend this towel to others.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with purchase &amp; how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li> Very absorbent&lt;br /&gt;Besides for hair and body we bought on just for wiping down shower tile walls and glass doors.</li>
            <li> My son is 3.5 and we&#x27;ve had it for 2 years.  This towel is lightweight and quick to dry him off.  The only downside is the funky texture.  Kind of sticks to your skin but we&#x27;ve gotten used to it.  We&#x27;ve washed it a ton and it still looks great.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would work better at drying my thick, curly hair that takes all day to dry.  It doesn&#x27;t really speed up drying time, although, when it does finally get dry, it&#x27;s maybe not quite as frizzy.  Sticks too much to my skin to use it to dry my body, so I just use it to wrap my head and leave on while I get ready for the day.  I would really recommend the smaller hair towel - I went with the bigger towel as I have past shoulder-length hair, but this is a little too big.</li>
