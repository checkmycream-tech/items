            <li>Great stuff, smells like a MAN, works well and goes on shmooooove once you&#x27;ve used it the first time.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my husband he loves this brand and what better then to fallow up w his taste</li>
            <li>This is my husbands favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>However my conclusion is that it is OK.</li>
            <li>That being said, this is my favorite anti perspirant.</li>
            <li>Has never failed him smell wise.</li>
            <li>and I think that I got a really good deal on them thanks to amazon</li>
            <li>It does not stain though and rubs off easily.</li>
            <li>Nice item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for over twenty years, now I have body odor lightly...</li>
            <li>I enjoy shopping here</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who likes a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the anti perspirant for years and like it for the light scent and that it is not sticky.</li>
            <li>The deodorant stick goes on smooth and smells like colognes.</li>
            <li>This is a very good price, quite sharp compared to the big-box pharmacy stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Item as described, fast shipping, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started buying more and more toiletries and household items online, which is easier than remembering to get smaller packages when needed at stores.</li>
            <li>Works super well.</li>
            <li>Only kind of protection my man uses..........</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry, has a nice scent</li>
            <li>exactly the Brut</li>
            <li>However I have always wondered what &amp;#34;Trimax&amp;#34; is and did some research and could find out exactly what is in it.</li>
            <li>I have a super sensitive nose and it is not so overpowering</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I am very allergic to the anti-perspirant ingrediant.  </li>
            <li>Fast....</li>
            <li>Glides on very well</li>
            <li>Fast Ship Time, Item just as described.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good price on deodorant, and this certainly was that, however, it is only average in performance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I would have been better off spending a little more money on something that didn&#x27;t need to be so heavily applied, or re-applied.</li>
            <li>Whatever the reason I tried Brut&#x27;s anti-perspirant and so far it works very well.</li>
            <li>I love that smell from the past...</li>
            <li>Mitchum glides on clear.</li>
            <li>It contains Triclosan which is common in many soaps and cleaning products, a somewhat contoversial chemical to some.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only type that really works and that I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li>so if your not careful it can come off onto your shirt when pulling it over your head.</li>

            <li> Nice item exactly as described. I&#x27;ve started buying more and more toiletries and household items online, which is easier than remembering to get smaller packages when needed at stores. This brand, for example, is often out of stock or difficult to find at my local store, so I appreciate the ability to stock up. If you like Brut combo product, this is a good value.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Scent seems to last the day.  Unfortunately, I am very allergic to the anti-perspirant ingrediant.  I get a rash within three days of use.</li>
            <li> best deodorant ever!!! great price also!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Not expired our anything. Hard to find this in my local stores anymore, but my wife will leave me if I start to smell different than how I&#x27;ve smelled for 32 years. So, this is a life saver.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, smells like a MAN, works well and goes on shmooooove once you&#x27;ve used it the first time. This is a very good price, quite sharp compared to the big-box pharmacy stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy way to have it on hand for the sweaty stinky days when just the deodorant isn&#x27;t quite going to cut it!</li>
            <li> Fast.... I love that smell from the past... BRUT ! ! !</li>
            <li> After switching to this deodorant, my pit stains reduced dramatically. Also, it smells manly without blasting you in the nose. GRRRR!</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry, has a nice scent and I use it alone or with the soap and cologne. It is white so if your not careful it can come off onto your shirt when pulling it over your head. It does not stain though and rubs off easily.</li>
            <li> exactly the Brut Anti- Perspirant/ Deodorant My Honey likes</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over twenty years, now I have body odor lightly...not sure if this was old stuff or what?  It also falls apart/disentigrates upon appllications</li>
            <li> Smells great, cheap price...provides excellent wetness protection.  What&#x27;s NOT to like....nothing!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my husband he loves this brand and what better then to fallow up w his taste it smells good and I think that I got a really good deal on them thanks to amazon I enjoy shopping here you guys have everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is awesome had it not been melted. Its the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate and literally cause peeling. Works super well. Has never failed him smell wise. I have a super sensitive nose and it is not so overpowering I get migraines so being that I can stand it and he can wear its great it has a great manly smell . it dies work for at least 24hrs. Has never failed tho its hard to find in our area</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite fragrance.  He uses all of Brut&#x27;s products.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the anti perspirant for years and like it for the light scent and that it is not sticky. Glides on very well and I can&#x27;t tell its on. Lasts all day too. However I have always wondered what &amp;#34;Trimax&amp;#34; is and did some research and could find out exactly what is in it. The ingredients are not listed. Made in Canada, so they must have different rules than the US. It contains Triclosan which is common in many soaps and cleaning products, a somewhat contoversial chemical to some. However my conclusion is that it is OK. That being said, this is my favorite anti perspirant.</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast shipping, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only type that really works and that I&#x27;ll use. I buy them off Amazon because they&#x27;re hard to find in stores around me. I do recommend ordering in the winter time, because summer heat in the UPS (or whoever) truck will cause them to melt and get greasy melted deodorant nastiness all over the cartridges and packaging. The product itself is good though.</li>
            <li> This is effective and the discount price is excellent. The deodorant stick goes on smooth and smells like colognes. The anti-perspirant stick is white rather than green.. I drags across the skin of the underarm and leaves a chalky, gummy residue.  Mitchum glides on clear.</li>
            <li> I can miss a day and not have to worry.  Did I mention great price.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this deodorant.  Great product and price.</li>
            <li> Fast Ship Time, Item just as described.  Great seller.  Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Better than going to the store to pick up!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good price on deodorant, and this certainly was that, however, it is only average in performance. The protection is adequate but not great, especially when I work out. I was also shocked at how quickly it ran out. I&#x27;m thinking I would have been better off spending a little more money on something that didn&#x27;t need to be so heavily applied, or re-applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure rating deodorant or anti-perspirant makes sense since individual body chemistry seems to vary from person to person. I found that after using English Leather deodorant for 30 years it seemed to be losing its effectiveness. I doubt the formula changed, but was probably a change in my body chemistry. Whatever the reason I tried Brut&#x27;s anti-perspirant and so far it works very well.</li>
            <li> Only kind of protection my man uses..........he LOVES this stuff!</li>
            <li> Bits break off when using it under arm and make quite a mess on the bathroom floor, not to mention underarms!</li>
            <li> great product, good price.  hard to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Great price, thank you for a quality product!</li>
            <li> Very glad to have it since I searched all the stores in my country for it until I ordered it online.</li>
