    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>i love it!!!!</li>
            <li>So, anyways, I&#x27;m seriously impressed.  </li>
            <li>If you have oily skin that breaks out, THE BEST product in this kit is the moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Great product for a great price!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 now and have been in search of a great acne product.</li>
            <li>It was great until I started using it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and even after making those adjustments, I am still getting great results.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s another good reason for me to mix it).</li>
            <li>Maybe in a month or two it won&#x27;t work for me, but as of right now I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>It was great for my sensitive skin and it smells awesome!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty awesome</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li>but I just spray rose water on my face after I use all three.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say I&#x27;ve tried something that seemed to work</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was thrilled, so I used it 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li>i love this, ive tried just about everything out there from antibiotics, acutane, to proactive....</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>She loves this skin system more than any of the others she has used and there have been many.</li>
            <li>I would love this if it helped more with the healing process.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>I really can say I see a great difference in one week of use.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried it....and its so cheap!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made my face any better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than all the fancy moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried from high-end stores.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have irritation and redness or dryness as a result from using it, and I love the price.</li>
            <li>which has been lovely for me.</li>
            <li>not any improvement in skin really, if anything it made it appear shinier, not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>let me make this easy for you and do a pros and cons</li>
            <li>One caveat is that its fairly strong and has at times caused some flaking and drying out of my non-oily sections of skin.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer isn&#x27;t greasy at all, it gives your skin a matte, smooth finish and the salicylic acid in</li>
            <li>i highly recommend and love it!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this before trying Pro-Active, and I&#x27;m glad I did because I saved so much money and probably saved my skin from a lot of chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>the only thing I somewhat liked is the tonic everything else was off.</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>This skin care system worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Just because a sticker on the outside of the box might say that it expires in 2015 make sure to view the expiration date found on the bottle itself.</li>
            <li>Of course I can&#x27;t tell you exactly which one is doing the trick</li>
            <li>Fabulous product to control your acne!!...bought for my 11 yrd old and it is being used in conjunction with Nature&#x27;s Cure 2 part Acne Treatment.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser, makes me itch like nothing else, so I am most likely allergic to it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to prevent drying/flaking, but does a good job of keeping skin clear.</li>
            <li>I waited two weeks before using it more frequently and my skin reacted by majorly drying out and becoming sensitive to the product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s seeming to last just fine, too.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell except the lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got the blue light therapy, the topicals, the Rx meds, antibiotics, naturals, oil cleansing method, the &amp;#34;water-only&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Before this she tried several others like neutrogena, asepsia, acne free and some doctor product and nothing has worked as this....Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I got this product fast, and I started using it immediately.</li>
            <li>I was really dissapointed in this product.</li>
            <li>The producs smell really nice and natural and shipping was way faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>My face is now only getting those really small, gone in a day type pimples which is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 1 month in but the true test for my hormonal brand of attackne is my womantime.  </li>
            <li>I had three large acne, under the skin type pimples and this stuff, along with maybe the pills, has really downsized them considerably.</li>
            <li>It DOES dry my skin out, but the moisturizing cream seems to be keeping it moisturized enough where I haven&#x27;t experienced flakey dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone to the dermatologist before and have had prescriptions, but even then I&#x27;d still have moderate to mild acne.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a tremendous difference in the last week.</li>
            <li>I love these products, but only use the cleanser daily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, its a decent product.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>These products are a great change from the other harsh smelling and feeling acne skin care systems.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many (MANY) other acne products since I was a teen (prescription and over the counter) in the past and none have actually given me completely clear skin...</li>
            <li>I would love to buy the pills by themselves, but not available.  </li>
            <li>i 100% recommend this product for those who have sensitive acne prone skin!</li>
            <li>Though this might be due to a couple things unique to me.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin that occasionally breaks out, this will probably be too strong for you.</li>
            <li>fix this issue, I have cut back to using it 1-2 times a day, using the toner only once a day, and I mix the lotion with my Clean &amp; Clear lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The repair lotion step, smells like nothing else (though this may be due to the fact that I am pregnant).</li>
            <li>Some anti-blemish moisturizers don&#x27;t clear acne because they&#x27;re too hydrating.</li>
            <li>anywho ive been using natures cure natural pills and this cleansing set for about 5-6 yrs</li>
            <li>This is like the fifth or sixth product I&#x27;ve tried, and though I&#x27;m only a week in, I really do like it.</li>
            <li>I had to stand in front of a fan for 30 seconds or so to cool it down.</li>
            <li>maybe even less, so I can somewhat confidently predict that it will last me 9 or 10 weeks before I have to buy more--which I will definitely do.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find these separately because I end up throwing lots of product away when I have to open a new kit for the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have been using the system for one month, and see absolutely no change in the positive direction.</li>
            <li>but this is a major drug and has major side effects..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently in the process of healing all the red marks but don&#x27;t have any new break outs (miracle!).</li>
            <li>The only reason i gave it a four instead of a five is because it did almost nothing for my blackheads and while it did prevent some zits, it did not aid in my already developed ones healing.</li>
            <li>My skin has less irritation, less bumps, less redness, more even tone, feels soft, and I look and feel like the old me when I see my face in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It did not dry out my skin, so that was decent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>did not dry my skin</li>
            <li>I love the system, but the toner does not last as long as the other 2 products so you end up having to buy another system before the previous one is all finished.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t contain ridiculous amounts of chemicals, which is a plus for such a cheap system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> it doesn&#x27;t contain ridiculous amounts of chemicals, which is a plus for such a cheap system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have extreme acne problems or a sensitive face.</li>
            <li> My hopes were high for the papaya extract, which helps to remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old, have oily skin with moderate acne and little to no scaring.</li>
            <li> Within two days, I saw a dramatic change in the blemishes I already had and saw no new ones (which was nice, because my skin has been particularly irritable these past several months, and I&#x27;d get a frustrating new bump every day or two).&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I have used about half of the supply and its been working for me.</li>
            <li> This was able to prevent crazy breakouts during that heinous time period</li>
            <li> I really like natures cure topical cream and hormonal pills, but this product is not good at all.</li>
            <li> Good products, but the bundling makes it really annoying</li>
            <li> The high % of salicylic acid, which is the only active ingredient, is a commonly used chemical, and it really is no surprise that it serves to only dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> , in the winter sometimes i cut back on the cleansing due to the dry weather, but these products always do the job for me and are inexpensive and make me feel like a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; person who can just wash their face rather than have 30 products to use for acne morning and night  </li>
            <li> I have also had no issues with dry or flaky skin with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very Irish skin, so my face is easily irritated by harsh products and the redness is difficult to get rid of--even with makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old, have combination skin, and never had a particularly hard time with acne until after I graduated college--</li>
            <li> My teenager is using this and other Nature Cure products.</li>
            <li> does not lather extremely (which is probably why the cleanser isn&#x27;t as drying as</li>
            <li> it worked until i got pregnant and my hormones went crazy...</li>
            <li> unfortunately non really worked, well except acutane</li>
            <li> Regardless, I find it embarrassing and annoying, and most things I&#x27;ve tried on the market make my skin tight, itch, and peel--then leaves me shiny anyway.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is why the price was slightly lower than $20</li>
            <li> Oddly, this seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> odd, I know.</li>
            <li> The product also expires in a little over 2months Feb 2014.</li>
            <li> No more shiny, greasy skin.</li>
            <li> I also got the pills that are from Nature&#x27;s Cure as well, as I get those under the skin hard acne bumps</li>
            <li> I feel like this is very shady behavior on Nature&#x27;s Cure part and because of it</li>
            <li> I got tired of prescriptions and decided to try some stuff online.</li>
            <li> but its not any worse.</li>
            <li> If anything It has just made it worse.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging because it does not come sealed.</li>
            <li> This product smells very bad and came looking like it was old and already opened.</li>
            <li> This should be illegal to sell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add updates if for some reason it decides to fail.</li>
            <li> My skin had no lingering redness from the product, but it was unpleasant to have to deal with the temporary stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously still fairly skeptical because I have tried LITERALLY (nah - figuratively) EVERYTHING!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> This product smelled bad-</li>
            <li> , I can see it&#x27;s helping to bring up all the bad stuff</li>
            <li> so this is very disappointing.</li>

            <li> Product was open inside the product packaging. Toner everywhere...no safety seal.</li>
            <li> i love this, ive tried just about everything out there from antibiotics, acutane, to proactive....unfortunately non really worked, well except acutane but this is a major drug and has major side effects..it worked until i got pregnant and my hormones went crazy...anywho ive been using natures cure natural pills and this cleansing set for about 5-6 yrs and i love it, in the winter sometimes i cut back on the cleansing due to the dry weather, but these products always do the job for me and are inexpensive and make me feel like a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; person who can just wash their face rather than have 30 products to use for acne morning and night  i highly recommend and love it!</li>
            <li> My teenager is using this and other Nature Cure products. She loves this skin system more than any of the others she has used and there have been many. I might add we have found that it needs to be used on a consistant basis. We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like this product - especially the toner.  But like another reviewer said, it runs out before the rest.  This is the problem with Nature&#x27;s Cure products overall.  Good products, but the bundling makes it really annoying and overall I&#x27;ve stopped buying.  For example, I had STACKS of the cream from the 2part system.  I had to just throw them in the garbage.  I would love to buy the pills by themselves, but not available.  I feel like this is very shady behavior on Nature&#x27;s Cure part and because of it, I&#x27;m looking for alternatives.  Why force a bundle system on your consumers?</li>
            <li> The product facial cleanser (1st step) consistency is watery and not a gel like it should be. The product also expires in a little over 2months Feb 2014. I use the product voer a time of 4-5months so this is very disappointing. Perhaps this is why the price was slightly lower than $20</li>
            <li> This skin care system worked pretty well. It was great for my sensitive skin and it smells awesome! These products are a great change from the other harsh smelling and feeling acne skin care systems. The only reason i gave it a four instead of a five is because it did almost nothing for my blackheads and while it did prevent some zits, it did not aid in my already developed ones healing. I would love this if it helped more with the healing process.</li>
            <li> I love the system, but the toner does not last as long as the other 2 products so you end up having to buy another system before the previous one is all finished. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This product smelled bad- the only thing I somewhat liked is the tonic everything else was off.</li>
            <li> I love this product.. i have been using it for about 3 weeks now and my skin is noticeably clearer, smoother and softer. i 100% recommend this product for those who have sensitive acne prone skin! i love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Just because a sticker on the outside of the box might say that it expires in 2015 make sure to view the expiration date found on the bottle itself. Just received an order that expired 2 years ago!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 10 or 11. I&#x27;m 21 now and have been in search of a great acne product. I&#x27;ve gone to the dermatologist before and have had prescriptions, but even then I&#x27;d still have moderate to mild acne. I got tired of prescriptions and decided to try some stuff online. This is like the fifth or sixth product I&#x27;ve tried, and though I&#x27;m only a week in, I really do like it. I also got the pills that are from Nature&#x27;s Cure as well, as I get those under the skin hard acne bumps and I believe only internal medication helps with that. I had three large acne, under the skin type pimples and this stuff, along with maybe the pills, has really downsized them considerably. My face is now only getting those really small, gone in a day type pimples which is great. Maybe in a month or two it won&#x27;t work for me, but as of right now I&#x27;m very happy with the product. It DOES dry my skin out, but the moisturizing cream seems to be keeping it moisturized enough where I haven&#x27;t experienced flakey dry skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this because you don&#x27;t need to put expired items on your face. This should be illegal to sell.</li>
            <li> It was great until I started using it twice a day. I waited two weeks before using it more frequently and my skin reacted by majorly drying out and becoming sensitive to the product.  If you can, I would only use this once a day.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!!</li>
            <li> So, I have been using this for about one week. I am using it in conjunction with the Two-Part Acne System for Females. Of course I can&#x27;t tell you exactly which one is doing the trick but I have noticed a tremendous difference in the last week. I do not have severe acne but definitely enough to make me feel yucky. I hate the smell of all three pruducts but I just spray rose water on my face after I use all three. The smell it so worth it. I really can say I see a great difference in one week of use. I will update if any changes occur. So glad I tried it....and its so cheap!</li>
            <li> Sold me 2 years expired product</li>
            <li> So far I have used about half of the supply and its been working for me. I am 34 years old, have oily skin with moderate acne and little to no scaring. I have tried many many (MANY) other acne products since I was a teen (prescription and over the counter) in the past and none have actually given me completely clear skin... this has done that for me. I&#x27;m currently in the process of healing all the red marks but don&#x27;t have any new break outs (miracle!). I have also had no issues with dry or flaky skin with this product.</li>
            <li> I love these products, but only use the cleanser daily.  I wish I could find these separately because I end up throwing lots of product away when I have to open a new kit for the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Works well with oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for like 2 weeks and it&#x27;s pretty awesome, I can see it&#x27;s helping to bring up all the bad stuff inmy skin it&#x27;s also making my skin brighter. The producs smell really nice and natural and shipping was way faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have been using it for years and it changed my life! It is gentle enough to prevent drying/flaking, but does a good job of keeping skin clear. Until I stated using this, I struggled to find something that would work well for my ance-prone skin. This kit has been the answer.</li>
            <li> Buen precio.&lt;br /&gt;Lo entregan en buen precio y es gratis el envio.&lt;br /&gt;Quedo a la perfeccion .&lt;br /&gt;el articulo se encontraba bien enpaquetado y seguro</li>
            <li> This product took forever to get here. I really like the smell except the lotion. The face wash is so runny. It hasn&#x27;t made my face any better but its not any worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously still fairly skeptical because I have tried LITERALLY (nah - figuratively) EVERYTHING!!!!!!  I&#x27;ve got the blue light therapy, the topicals, the Rx meds, antibiotics, naturals, oil cleansing method, the &amp;#34;water-only&amp;#34; method to no avail.  Oddly, this seems to be working.  I&#x27;m only 1 month in but the true test for my hormonal brand of attackne is my womantime.  This was able to prevent crazy breakouts during that heinous time period so I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  One caveat is that its fairly strong and has at times caused some flaking and drying out of my non-oily sections of skin.  I&#x27;ve used jojoba on those areas to their delight.  So, anyways, I&#x27;m seriously impressed.  I&#x27;ll add updates if for some reason it decides to fail.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product to control your acne!!...bought for my 11 yrd old and it is being used in conjunction with Nature&#x27;s Cure 2 part Acne Treatment.  Before this she tried several others like neutrogena, asepsia, acne free and some doctor product and nothing has worked as this....Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My hopes were high for the papaya extract, which helps to remove dead skin cells. I have been using the system for one month, and see absolutely no change in the positive direction. The high % of salicylic acid, which is the only active ingredient, is a commonly used chemical, and it really is no surprise that it serves to only dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t deserve one star. Never had the chance to try it. All products were expired on arrival. One of them a year ago!! I&#x27;m sending it back</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin that breaks out, THE BEST product in this kit is the moisturizer! It clears acne and keeps your skin matte! No more shiny, greasy skin. Anytime I get a breakout, this stuff comes to my rescue. It literally dries up pimples overnight. Some anti-blemish moisturizers don&#x27;t clear acne because they&#x27;re too hydrating. This moisturizer isn&#x27;t greasy at all, it gives your skin a matte, smooth finish and the salicylic acid in it keeps zits away and dries up existing blemishes. I hope they never stop making this stuff. The moisturizer is my holy grail product!! It&#x27;s much better than all the fancy moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried from high-end stores. This stuff is the answer to my prayers. If you have dry skin that occasionally breaks out, this will probably be too strong for you. This stuff is a lifesaver for truly oily skin that&#x27;s prone to acne. It even dries up cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I ordered this about 5 months ago and it has shown no results what so ever. If anything It has just made it worse.</li>
            <li> This product smells very bad and came looking like it was old and already opened. I really like natures cure topical cream and hormonal pills, but this product is not good at all. Poor packaging because it does not come sealed.</li>
            <li> I have very Irish skin, so my face is easily irritated by harsh products and the redness is difficult to get rid of--even with makeup. I&#x27;m 30 years old, have combination skin, and never had a particularly hard time with acne until after I graduated college--odd, I know. Regardless, I find it embarrassing and annoying, and most things I&#x27;ve tried on the market make my skin tight, itch, and peel--then leaves me shiny anyway. I can&#x27;t honestly say I&#x27;ve tried something that seemed to work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now. I got this product fast, and I started using it immediately. Within two days, I saw a dramatic change in the blemishes I already had and saw no new ones (which was nice, because my skin has been particularly irritable these past several months, and I&#x27;d get a frustrating new bump every day or two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled, so I used it 2-3 times a day. Well, after 3-4 days, my skin started to burn--kind of like when you re-apply sunscreen on a sunburned face at the beach. I had to stand in front of a fan for 30 seconds or so to cool it down. My skin had no lingering redness from the product, but it was unpleasant to have to deal with the temporary stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fix this issue, I have cut back to using it 1-2 times a day, using the toner only once a day, and I mix the lotion with my Clean &amp; Clear lotion. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and even after making those adjustments, I am still getting great results. My skin has less irritation, less bumps, less redness, more even tone, feels soft, and I look and feel like the old me when I see my face in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product. I was floored with results after 2 days. The lotion smells great--if you like fruity smells, isn&#x27;t greasy (in fact, it&#x27;s almost not moisturizing ENOUGH, so it&#x27;s another good reason for me to mix it). I love that I don&#x27;t have irritation and redness or dryness as a result from using it, and I love the price. I decided to try this before trying Pro-Active, and I&#x27;m glad I did because I saved so much money and probably saved my skin from a lot of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s seeming to last just fine, too. I figured it&#x27;d last 1-2 months with regular use, but after 3 weeks, I&#x27;m only about 1/3 of the way through it--maybe even less, so I can somewhat confidently predict that it will last me 9 or 10 weeks before I have to buy more--which I will definitely do.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this. I&#x27;ve had acne problems since I was 8... which has been lovely for me. I am now almost twenty one. I was really dissapointed in this product. Though this might be due to a couple things unique to me. The cleanser, makes me itch like nothing else, so I am most likely allergic to it. That being said. It did not dry out my skin, so that was decent.&lt;br /&gt;The repair lotion step, smells like nothing else (though this may be due to the fact that I am pregnant). It didn&#x27;t go away either, I could smell it for hours after I applied it. It didn&#x27;t even go away after spraying (liberally) perfume all over me. I feel like you get what you pay for. If you have extreme acne problems or a sensitive face. I believe you should try something else. let me make this easy for you and do a pros and cons list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- did not dry my skin&lt;br /&gt;- does not lather extremely (which is probably why the cleanser isn&#x27;t as drying as others)&lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t contain ridiculous amounts of chemicals, which is a plus for such a cheap system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Allergic reaction&lt;br /&gt;- Smells terrible&lt;br /&gt;- not any improvement in skin really, if anything it made it appear shinier, not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a decent product. Just not for me.</li>
