            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>It helped control my oil for about 2-3 hours which wasn&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over six months now (over 4 bottles) and I am loving it!  </li>
            <li>Works great controlling oily skin plus it smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>- I did not find it pleasant.</li>

            <li>Good size tube at a good price.</li>
            <li>Gonna get a good mask and some peel-off masks/strips to shrink my pores</li>
            <li>Really good lotion for oily skin.</li>
            <li>I came across the Kyoku accidentally and decided to give it a try after seeing some good reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, the citrus scent is very pleasant and I strongly urge you to buy this for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(You are welcome in advance :-) ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the scrub and I love it!</li>
            <li>but this is the first product which does an excellent job!.</li>
            <li>Love Kyoku for Men!</li>
            <li>amazing, he also has not had any problems with it breaking him out or causing any irritation.</li>
            <li>while keeping shine away for 4-5 hrs, has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>it is quite effective  </li>
            <li>Kyoku for Men has many good products and they didn&#x27;t disappoint with this one.</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be nice to add after a moisturizer</li>
            <li>Also, this product keeps your face from that oily shine that can develop over the course of a warm</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for a very convenient price.</li>
            <li>it does work nicely.</li>
            <li>It does have a pleasant smell and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>This lotion makes it smooth and been told by girls that love to rub bald heads, feels great.  </li>
            <li>So far this product is the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Either way, not bloody good.</li>
            <li>Right after application I could tell that my face had a great matte look</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really mattify but its a good oil control lotion and its a good smell too...</li>
            <li>This lotion was described as a great product therefore I have taken the risk and try it out however the shiny on my forget does not disappear that much</li>
            <li>and it worked a bit better for me</li>
            <li>It made me MORE oily.</li>
            <li>Even better than Clinique oil control hydrator.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a magical serum to eliminate all signs of moisture from your face, Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion is for YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definately be trying some more products from Kyoku.</li>
            <li>The product is ok.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>Smell and consistency are ok but products leaves an ashy film on skin.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth matte finish that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>However, everytime I use it, the product seems to be peeling off, not so sure of what was happening?</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see how this works when my face is more oily in 100-degree temps in the summer.</li>
            <li>I will keep using it until I find something better.</li>
            <li>Results may last for an hour at best.</li>
            <li>Aside from from being a great moisturizer, it really lives up to its claims of oil control.  </li>
            <li>Even with its shortcomings, I love it.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s the best someone with an oily facial complexion can expect in the tropics)</li>
            <li>This was one of the better mattifier type lotions that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>So thumbs up, 5 stars, ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li>And it does an EXCELLENT job at keeping your face oil-free...however, be very very careful when applying this product to your face.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and not a lot is required.</li>
            <li>easy to use and does the job</li>
            <li>Strong petroleum smell</li>
            <li>It does work but it has a strong smell</li>
            <li>Absolutely as described and more!</li>
            <li>The reason I keep using it is because it is light, yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for something to replace the Clarins Men Shine Free gel that was discontinued a year or two ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It provides Super oil control, plus needed non greasy moisturizing in one puts this in a class of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to apply to a clean face immediately after washing and patting dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>And the price is great for how long it lasts...</li>
            <li>It goes on cleanly, but leaves my face dryer than not using it.</li>
            <li>Though I shouldnt be surprised, I recently purchased the Kyoku pre electric shave and was very happy with the quality, smell and the fact the product just did what it claimed to do.</li>
            <li>He really likes the very light scent of this one.  </li>
            <li>However I gave this product line to a friend and he is hooked said able to tell a large difference in the quality of his skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product that does exactly what it is meant for.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally review, but I have been so happy with Kyoku products that I was surprised that this one didn&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li>Being a naturally oily and greasy man-face; I would have liked this to work</li>
            <li>I personally have fairly oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li>I feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells wonderfully clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>but i dont really know if it is better than any products and if it worth the 60 dollar price tag.  </li>
            <li>My husband has super oily skin and this stuff helps.</li>
            <li>i have tried other oil control products like nivea for men and it didn&#x27;t work very effective.</li>
            <li>this is actually my very first oil control lotion.   </li>
            <li>I thought Clinique poor minimized (original) formula was the best.</li>
            <li>I felt like the residue was more oily than what my face normally is.</li>
            <li>I can easily go through 2 or 3 absorbing sheets a day.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes without causing your face to look oily!</li>
            <li>I did not find it useful.</li>
            <li>One drawback of this product is that you have to use more amount of this lotion in order to completely moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li>me, this wasn&#x27;t worth the price</li>
            <li>and it keeps my face looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>When first applied, it makes your skin look as though the oil will be controlled, however the effects diminish rather quickly -- within 1 to 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>so trying to find something to help me out with both is kind of tough in this product does a pretty good job of that</li>
            <li>its all right but</li>
            <li>It only works on my face for about 4-5hrs, but everyone doesn&#x27;t have the same complexion, so overall it&#x27;s a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really got my full skin regime figured out yet</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, you really need to be sure to rub it in and you really don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
            <li>At the begining it was good, but I think our skin get used to it, so the time that this product works just goes down.</li>
            <li>This does a good job with toning down the oil and shine of my face.  </li>
            <li>But, if you have super oil skin this stuff will stop the shine all day and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a girl ;)</li>
            <li>Act now and be amazed at how much drier your face can be!</li>
            <li>I would just say if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s tried many different products hoping that this will be the one, with my experience</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product and I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 4 stars is because you better check the mirror before you leave the house.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be trying more Kyoku products.</li>
            <li>works great for bald head for about an hour then loses its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>and I intend to order more in the future!</li>
            <li>I tried this product coming from Clinique M-gel lotion to try something different and it is OK.</li>
            <li>This produce delivers exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think this worked that well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally found something that works for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of months, and I still use it everyday because it does a good job moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li>He says that his skin feels comfortable and not tight when he puts this on after washing his face in the morning or at night, but that it leaves his skin matte and not oily in the T-zone almost all day.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I think that this lotion does it job of absorbing oil.</li>
            <li>Oil mattifying effect is decent but only lasts about 2-3 hours at most if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li>Something like a very light facial peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found other products that are more effective for half the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While this stuff has a pleasant menthol like smell, and works okay as a general facial lotion, it did little or nothing to control the oil.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you are totally dry and also not sweating at all when you put it on.</li>
            <li>This is cheaply produced product that is obviously toxic.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping A++++</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this, and will be buying again!</li>
            <li>This helped control my shine for almost the whole day..</li>
            <li>Absorbs very well even if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than purchasing through Grooming Lounge.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable on face.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Since it dries on semi-white, it makes whatever redness you have really pop.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband uses it all the time.iv also gt very oily skin</li>
            <li>Well, this product performs very well.  </li>
            <li>Grooming Lounge also packed the product very well and included a brochure of the men products they are selling.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps because I have a darker complexion, it leaves a very visible gloss (not shiny but glossy).</li>
            <li>It you use too much of it</li>
            <li>but you dont need much to cover your face and your getting premium quality.</li>
            <li>I have a really oily face</li>
            <li>It works very well  now.  </li>
            <li>is working very well already</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>and this really helped.</li>
            <li>I have very oily/shinny skin</li>
            <li>and this really helps.  </li>
            <li>Very pleasing smell.  </li>
            <li>I am bald and use it on my whole face and head, as shaving dries out my head.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is very oily, as this isn&#x27;t something for those who have partially oily skin (like me).</li>
            <li>There are other mattifiers that work much better and don&#x27;t leave your face oily after application.</li>
            <li>I think the price has come down a lot since others posted about it because when I saw the price I thought it was very cheap.  </li>
            <li>It absorbed easily, but already looked a little bit shiny.</li>
            <li>Once he puts it on he is oil free all day long!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all decent but none come close to this product.</li>
            <li>That is the main reason I used it.  </li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s not particularly well hydrated, this is going to kind of burn and make you red.</li>
            <li>rather the normal oily look that I tend to get.</li>
            <li>I have a normal face with kinda oily nose and forehead area.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product If you have normal skin and just want to get rid of the oily nose and forehead part.</li>
            <li>I have a normal skin type, which is not shiny after being cleansed.</li>
            <li>AND I live in the tropics where humidity is 80-90% year-round.  </li>
            <li>Well it definitely sucks up most oils when it comes in contact with the skin but doesn&#x27;t really control anything.</li>
            <li>After using kyoku daily facial cleaner and the kyoku scrub in the morning, I applied a pea-sized amount of this oil-control lotion, lightly covering my neck and face.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B002NV7NDQ Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]]have never tried Kyoku, but I am very please with the extremely high quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves a bit of a residue but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like many other creams.</li>
            <li>If you put on too much, you will have white streaks on your face.</li>
            <li>1 hour later my face was very oily.</li>
            <li>Keeps shine at bay, but doesn&#x27;t last much; I use it on my bald head and after an hour it was already gone.</li>
            <li>I saw this product on amazon with also knowing japanese products are very well too.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It will leave white streaks on your face if you use too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s different for very oily skin</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin on my facial area</li>
            <li>The only real solution is to use a blotting film.</li>
            <li>recommending you scrub to exfoliate ONLY at bedtime, and gently wash your face in the morning, to inhibit the pores from pumping out oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference between this and regular, non oil control lotion.</li>
            <li>In response to those that said it left them with a chalky texture I would say they probably used too much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a white-ish lotion that dries on clear, so long as you take extra special care to rub all of it in until it&#x27;s completely dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While some lotions leave your face feeling hydrated and comfortable, only Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion actively desiccates your facial skin surfaces to leave your pores parched and punished.</li>
            <li>Nothing will work all day long, so expect to re-apply this occasionally, but it does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>It does work in the anti-shine front but not usable as the residual film is very apparent.</li>
            <li>Makes my face white as a ghost (even after rubbing into my face for what I feel is a long enough time) and drier and PULLED once it has fully absorbed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;During the day, blot with a paper towel IF you need to, OR if you can find them, use the large tissue paper toilet seat liners found in a lot of public restrooms.  </li>
            <li>This is especially apparent when I look at photos of myself - especially those taken toward the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 15 year old son along with the facial scrub and cleanser. has done wonders for his skin.</li>
            <li>Barely even moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t return it apparently.</li>
            <li>I sometimes put a thin layer of moisturizer on, then top of it off with this lotion.</li>
            <li>Over all good but not great because I was looking for something that would also have a slight matte effect  as in take away the shine.</li>
            <li>Have to be careful not to use too much and to spread it evenly as you can get the white powder appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, it didn&#x27;t seem that it would work at all, but after a couple of minutes, when it dried, it left a shine-free finish with my skin still moisturized.</li>
            <li>it only takes a little dab, so it doesn&#x27;t get used up too fast.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works great controlling oily skin plus it smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> - I did not find it pleasant.</li>
            <li> it smells really good</li>
            <li> Good size tube at a good price.</li>
            <li> Gonna get a good mask and some peel-off masks/strips to shrink my pores</li>
            <li> Really good lotion for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I came across the Kyoku accidentally and decided to give it a try after seeing some good reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, the citrus scent is very pleasant and I strongly urge you to buy this for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (You are welcome in advance :-) ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the scrub and I love it!</li>
            <li> but this is the first product which does an excellent job!.</li>
            <li> Love Kyoku for Men!</li>
            <li> amazing, he also has not had any problems with it breaking him out or causing any irritation.</li>
            <li> while keeping shine away for 4-5 hrs, has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> it is quite effective  </li>
            <li> Kyoku for Men has many good products and they didn&#x27;t disappoint with this one.</li>
            <li> so I thought this would be nice to add after a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Also, this product keeps your face from that oily shine that can develop over the course of a warm</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for a very convenient price.</li>
            <li> it does work nicely.</li>
            <li> It does have a pleasant smell and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes it smooth and been told by girls that love to rub bald heads, feels great.  </li>
            <li> So far this product is the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Either way, not bloody good.</li>
            <li> Right after application I could tell that my face had a great matte look</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really mattify but its a good oil control lotion and its a good smell too...</li>
            <li> This lotion was described as a great product therefore I have taken the risk and try it out however the shiny on my forget does not disappear that much</li>
            <li> and it worked a bit better for me</li>
            <li> It made me MORE oily.</li>
            <li> Even better than Clinique oil control hydrator.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a magical serum to eliminate all signs of moisture from your face, Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion is for YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definately be trying some more products from Kyoku.</li>
            <li> The product is ok.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Smell and consistency are ok but products leaves an ashy film on skin.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth matte finish that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> However, everytime I use it, the product seems to be peeling off, not so sure of what was happening?</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how this works when my face is more oily in 100-degree temps in the summer.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it until I find something better.</li>
            <li> Results may last for an hour at best.</li>
            <li> Aside from from being a great moisturizer, it really lives up to its claims of oil control.  </li>
            <li> Even with its shortcomings, I love it.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s the best someone with an oily facial complexion can expect in the tropics)</li>
            <li> This was one of the better mattifier type lotions that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> So thumbs up, 5 stars, ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li> And it does an EXCELLENT job at keeping your face oil-free...however, be very very careful when applying this product to your face.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and not a lot is required.</li>
            <li> easy to use and does the job</li>
            <li> Strong petroleum smell</li>
            <li> It does work but it has a strong smell</li>
            <li> Absolutely as described and more!</li>
            <li> The reason I keep using it is because it is light, yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something to replace the Clarins Men Shine Free gel that was discontinued a year or two ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It provides Super oil control, plus needed non greasy moisturizing in one puts this in a class of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to apply to a clean face immediately after washing and patting dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> And the price is great for how long it lasts...</li>
            <li> It goes on cleanly, but leaves my face dryer than not using it.</li>
            <li> Though I shouldnt be surprised, I recently purchased the Kyoku pre electric shave and was very happy with the quality, smell and the fact the product just did what it claimed to do.</li>
            <li> He really likes the very light scent of this one.  </li>
            <li> However I gave this product line to a friend and he is hooked said able to tell a large difference in the quality of his skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product that does exactly what it is meant for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review, but I have been so happy with Kyoku products that I was surprised that this one didn&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li> Being a naturally oily and greasy man-face; I would have liked this to work</li>
            <li> I personally have fairly oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderfully clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> but i dont really know if it is better than any products and if it worth the 60 dollar price tag.  </li>
            <li> My husband has super oily skin and this stuff helps.</li>
            <li> i have tried other oil control products like nivea for men and it didn&#x27;t work very effective.</li>
            <li> this is actually my very first oil control lotion.   </li>
            <li> I thought Clinique poor minimized (original) formula was the best.</li>
            <li> I felt like the residue was more oily than what my face normally is.</li>
            <li> I can easily go through 2 or 3 absorbing sheets a day.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes without causing your face to look oily!</li>
            <li> I did not find it useful.</li>
            <li> One drawback of this product is that you have to use more amount of this lotion in order to completely moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li> me, this wasn&#x27;t worth the price</li>
            <li> and it keeps my face looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> When first applied, it makes your skin look as though the oil will be controlled, however the effects diminish rather quickly -- within 1 to 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> so trying to find something to help me out with both is kind of tough in this product does a pretty good job of that</li>
            <li> its all right but</li>
            <li> It only works on my face for about 4-5hrs, but everyone doesn&#x27;t have the same complexion, so overall it&#x27;s a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really got my full skin regime figured out yet</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, you really need to be sure to rub it in and you really don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
            <li> At the begining it was good, but I think our skin get used to it, so the time that this product works just goes down.</li>
            <li> This does a good job with toning down the oil and shine of my face.  </li>
            <li> But, if you have super oil skin this stuff will stop the shine all day and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl ;)</li>
            <li> Act now and be amazed at how much drier your face can be!</li>
            <li> I would just say if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s tried many different products hoping that this will be the one, with my experience</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product and I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars is because you better check the mirror before you leave the house.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be trying more Kyoku products.</li>
            <li> works great for bald head for about an hour then loses its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> and I intend to order more in the future!</li>
            <li> I tried this product coming from Clinique M-gel lotion to try something different and it is OK.</li>
            <li> This produce delivers exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think this worked that well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally found something that works for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months, and I still use it everyday because it does a good job moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> He says that his skin feels comfortable and not tight when he puts this on after washing his face in the morning or at night, but that it leaves his skin matte and not oily in the T-zone almost all day.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I think that this lotion does it job of absorbing oil.</li>
            <li> Oil mattifying effect is decent but only lasts about 2-3 hours at most if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Something like a very light facial peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found other products that are more effective for half the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While this stuff has a pleasant menthol like smell, and works okay as a general facial lotion, it did little or nothing to control the oil.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you are totally dry and also not sweating at all when you put it on.</li>
            <li> This is cheaply produced product that is obviously toxic.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping A++++</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this, and will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This helped control my shine for almost the whole day..</li>
            <li> Absorbs very well even if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than purchasing through Grooming Lounge.</li>
            <li> Very noticeable on face.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Since it dries on semi-white, it makes whatever redness you have really pop.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband uses it all the time.iv also gt very oily skin</li>
            <li> Well, this product performs very well.  </li>
            <li> Grooming Lounge also packed the product very well and included a brochure of the men products they are selling.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps because I have a darker complexion, it leaves a very visible gloss (not shiny but glossy).</li>
            <li> It you use too much of it</li>
            <li> but you dont need much to cover your face and your getting premium quality.</li>
            <li> I have a really oily face</li>
            <li> It works very well  now.  </li>
            <li> is working very well already</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> and this really helped.</li>
            <li> I have very oily/shinny skin</li>
            <li> and this really helps.  </li>
            <li> Very pleasing smell.  </li>
            <li> I am bald and use it on my whole face and head, as shaving dries out my head.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is very oily, as this isn&#x27;t something for those who have partially oily skin (like me).</li>
            <li> There are other mattifiers that work much better and don&#x27;t leave your face oily after application.</li>
            <li> I think the price has come down a lot since others posted about it because when I saw the price I thought it was very cheap.  </li>
            <li> It absorbed easily, but already looked a little bit shiny.</li>
            <li> Once he puts it on he is oil free all day long!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all decent but none come close to this product.</li>
            <li> That is the main reason I used it.  </li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s not particularly well hydrated, this is going to kind of burn and make you red.</li>
            <li> rather the normal oily look that I tend to get.</li>
            <li> I have a normal face with kinda oily nose and forehead area.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product If you have normal skin and just want to get rid of the oily nose and forehead part.</li>
            <li> I have a normal skin type, which is not shiny after being cleansed.</li>
            <li> AND I live in the tropics where humidity is 80-90% year-round.  </li>
            <li> Well it definitely sucks up most oils when it comes in contact with the skin but doesn&#x27;t really control anything.</li>
            <li> After using kyoku daily facial cleaner and the kyoku scrub in the morning, I applied a pea-sized amount of this oil-control lotion, lightly covering my neck and face.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002NV7NDQ Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]]have never tried Kyoku, but I am very please with the extremely high quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a residue but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like many other creams.</li>
            <li> If you put on too much, you will have white streaks on your face.</li>
            <li> 1 hour later my face was very oily.</li>
            <li> Keeps shine at bay, but doesn&#x27;t last much; I use it on my bald head and after an hour it was already gone.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on amazon with also knowing japanese products are very well too.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It will leave white streaks on your face if you use too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s different for very oily skin</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin on my facial area</li>
            <li> The only real solution is to use a blotting film.</li>
            <li> recommending you scrub to exfoliate ONLY at bedtime, and gently wash your face in the morning, to inhibit the pores from pumping out oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference between this and regular, non oil control lotion.</li>
            <li> In response to those that said it left them with a chalky texture I would say they probably used too much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white-ish lotion that dries on clear, so long as you take extra special care to rub all of it in until it&#x27;s completely dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While some lotions leave your face feeling hydrated and comfortable, only Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion actively desiccates your facial skin surfaces to leave your pores parched and punished.</li>
            <li> Nothing will work all day long, so expect to re-apply this occasionally, but it does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> It does work in the anti-shine front but not usable as the residual film is very apparent.</li>
            <li> Makes my face white as a ghost (even after rubbing into my face for what I feel is a long enough time) and drier and PULLED once it has fully absorbed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;During the day, blot with a paper towel IF you need to, OR if you can find them, use the large tissue paper toilet seat liners found in a lot of public restrooms.  </li>
            <li> This is especially apparent when I look at photos of myself - especially those taken toward the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 15 year old son along with the facial scrub and cleanser. has done wonders for his skin.</li>
            <li> Barely even moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t return it apparently.</li>
            <li> I sometimes put a thin layer of moisturizer on, then top of it off with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Over all good but not great because I was looking for something that would also have a slight matte effect  as in take away the shine.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful not to use too much and to spread it evenly as you can get the white powder appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, it didn&#x27;t seem that it would work at all, but after a couple of minutes, when it dried, it left a shine-free finish with my skin still moisturized.</li>
            <li> it only takes a little dab, so it doesn&#x27;t get used up too fast.</li>
            <li> It is oily as any other regular cream, not as near as oily skin</li>
            <li> A lot of people had success with this according to Amazon reviews as well as a few other sources.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has extremely oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found great moisturizers in the past that got rid of my dry skin, but half way through the day I look like I&#x27;ve broken out into a sweat.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long, long way especially if used only on the T-zone (forehead and nose).</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t last long for me.</li>
            <li> I expect it to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Looks like old stock that either evaporated or they are selling refurbished lotion, or they just fill up their product half way, kick it around a bit when in the box, and s</li>
            <li> , it can dry leaving white streaks on your face.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clearer and far less oily.</li>
            <li> I like a lot of Kyoku products but this one left my skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> all day/night long.  </li>
            <li> consistency and texture of the lotion itself is also somewhat strange.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep my face oil-free for as long as I would like it too (my face gets oily after about an hour after putting this on).</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t feel like it lasts that long.</li>
            <li> If you put too much on, you&#x27;ll leave white film on your face as it dries, particularly when temps are cold.</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;m going back to the other product.</li>
            <li> It will dry up the oil without drying up your skin, so you don&#x27;t have that sheen</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry my face, but there is NO oil and NO shine whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a moisturizer before so it doesn&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dry and oily skin for some time now.  </li>
            <li> Dry skin that gets too oily when I use moisturizer</li>
            <li> I understand it&#x27;s most likely difficult to create a product that controls oil while simultaneously moisturizing, but this product is not particularly effective in balancing both tasks.  </li>
            <li> You need to wait a few minutes until it is dry to see if you are left with any streaks!</li>
            <li> There re really not a lot of options, for mens face shine control, so I decided to experiment on this brand.</li>
            <li> If this happens, just apply a few drops of water to your face and rub off the white streaks.  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money trying to find something that worked as well.  </li>
            <li> Does not really extinguish the shine....</li>
            <li> PLAIN AND SIMPLE...</li>
            <li> That would be the only downfall but usually my face doesn&#x27;t get oily in the winter due to the dry air anyways.</li>
            <li> Also didn&#x27;t really seem to help that much with oil, was fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Got this a few days back - tube was about half empty.</li>
            <li> I have to add both a tinted moisturizer and another moisturizer; until that point my skin looks older, drier and worse.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I guess i will try out some other products along the way before i can fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Other products have not either, and it does seem to work for some people.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> With other lotions like Oil of Olay,</li>
            <li> I plan to order other products from Amazon (Grooming Lounge).</li>
            <li> and I used products that I&#x27;ve bought from other retail stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mattifying products as well and none of them work.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on your face like other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> and I have had no issues with breakouts or other skin issues after using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a wheelchair and have trouble lifting my hands up to wipe my face off; there&#x27;s nothing quite as bad as knowing you&#x27;re shiny and not being able to do anything about it.  </li>
            <li> my face gets pretty dry in the cold weather</li>
            <li> Still does hardly anything to control facial oil.  </li>
            <li> Why pay nothing for the minor discomfort of not applying any moisturizer at all when Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion can turn the rugged contours of your face into the dusty sands of the desert for only $10 a bottle?</li>
            <li> or maybe it&#x27;s just not for cold and windy climates but when applied to normal face, it leaves white marks.</li>
            <li> for the price, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to look at your face a few minutes after you apply it.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, to the envy of some OPEC nations, so I was a little skeptical that this would work, but</li>
            <li> the amount of lotion in it is way too less than it shows.</li>
            <li> half of it is AIR.</li>
            <li> It does make my face less shiny and less greasy.  </li>
            <li> lotions from Jack Black, Kiehl&#x27;s, and Anthony.</li>
            <li> the effect lasts about 2hrs on my face and the bottle is like half air.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be hit or miss, as odd as it sounds, sometimes it works to reduce the oils, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, but if you are looking for a matted lotion this is one I would recommend.</li>
            <li> price is usually half or less of the others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> so I had to rub them away with a little bit of water.</li>
            <li> If I use this in the winter my face tends to get dried out.</li>
            <li> but I am not having any trouble with it.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes without feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li> waste your $ on blotting papers.  </li>
            <li> have continued to use this lotion for a few months now instead of just tossing it out.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from oil skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past few days and already seeing improvments to my skin, all the blemishes I had have bassically cleared up.</li>
            <li> You get a large packet, ~ a couple HUNDRED for a little $, and they are identical to the insanely priced &#x27;facial&#x27; blotters.</li>
            <li> I use very little of both--about 1/3 of a pea-size amount.  </li>
            <li> I use very little and don&#x27;t notice any chalkiness at all.  </li>
            <li> I tried to return it but realized we were past the date</li>
            <li> If you fail to do this, it makes that area of your face white.  </li>
            <li> If you like a small blotting sheet, go to a beauty superstore and purchase JUMBO PERM wrapped papers.  </li>
            <li> no more oily shiny looks..</li>
            <li> The tube is small for the price</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks.  </li>
            <li> and he&#x27;d never really liked the scent.  </li>
            <li> My husband had used Anthony for Men Oil-Free lotion for years, but we got tired of the price</li>
            <li> This did not work well at all for me as I had a very serious allergic skin reaction to this product line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed and will stick with Garnier, Loreal and all the other known companies.</li>
            <li> Although my complain is that it is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Weird smell tought.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> It sits on the skin in a thin layer and will absorb like crazy-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re both that expensive.  </li>
            <li> THIS ITEM SUCKS!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it was because of the cold weather and blowing wind, but after I used kyoku&#x27;s exfoliating scrub</li>
            <li> not to bad though</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m pulling mad tail bro!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Worst part was, it leaves an almost tacky film on your skin.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This lotion was described as a great product therefore I have taken the risk and try it out however the shiny on my forget does not disappear that much it smells really good I can tell but besides that it does not remove the shiny skin. Probable that depends on every people</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Oil mattifying effect is decent but only lasts about 2-3 hours at most if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff but doesn&#x27;t last all day about 4-6hrs</li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s not particularly well hydrated, this is going to kind of burn and make you red. Also didn&#x27;t really seem to help that much with oil, was fairly disappointed. I used this underneath the SPF moisturizer they have and it worked a bit better for me but I didn&#x27;t need this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks.  It made me MORE oily.</li>
            <li> its all right but the amount of lotion in it is way too less than it shows. half of it is AIR.</li>
            <li> So far this product is the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  Even better than Clinique oil control hydrator.  It does provide moisturization while keeping shine away for 4-5 hrs, has a nice smell.  In my case, that&#x27;s excellent given how oily my skin is.  Although my complain is that it is too expensive.  Don&#x27;t know if I can afford it again, but it does work.</li>
            <li> it is quite effective  i have quite an oily skin. this thing worked quite well.  but i dont really know if it is better than any products and if it worth the 60 dollar price tag.  this is actually my very first oil control lotion.   I guess i will try out some other products along the way before i can fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best oil control product I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Good size tube at a good price. Not just for men! I&#x27;m a girl ;)</li>
            <li> This is cheaply produced product that is obviously toxic. My skin rejected this.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick...love the lotion</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, to the envy of some OPEC nations, so I was a little skeptical that this would work, but skipping to the chase, it did. When I first applied it, it didn&#x27;t seem that it would work at all, but after a couple of minutes, when it dried, it left a shine-free finish with my skin still moisturized. Nothing will work all day long, so expect to re-apply this occasionally, but it does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> It goes on cleanly, but leaves my face dryer than not using it. It might just be my face, but I would never buy it again, which is a shame, as I like the rest of the Kyoku line</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a magical serum to eliminate all signs of moisture from your face, Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion is for YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some lotions leave your face feeling hydrated and comfortable, only Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion actively desiccates your facial skin surfaces to leave your pores parched and punished. You&#x27;ll not only feel the tightness and irritability across your nose, cheeks, and forehead, you&#x27;ll actually see the lotion at work as the skin on your face begins to flake off, leaving a decorative dusting of faceflakes on your shirt or jacket. No need to reapply lotion; you&#x27;ll get this result if you use it once or three times in ten minutes! Why pay nothing for the minor discomfort of not applying any moisturizer at all when Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion can turn the rugged contours of your face into the dusty sands of the desert for only $10 a bottle? Act now and be amazed at how much drier your face can be!</li>
            <li> This lotion BURNED and STUNG both my husband and my teenage son.  I tried to return it but realized we were past the date so we threw it out.  Please avoid this product.  PS - my son doesn&#x27;t shave so it&#x27;s not like he put it on razor burn.</li>
            <li> It does nothing for me.  Other products have not either, and it does seem to work for some people.  I would just say if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s tried many different products hoping that this will be the one, with my experience it is not the one.</li>
            <li> Great Seller.Fast Shipping A++++</li>
            <li> Didnt work face still oily as ever</li>
            <li> Strong petroleum smell</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past few days and already seeing improvments to my skin, all the blemishes I had have bassically cleared up. I will definately be trying some more products from Kyoku.</li>
            <li> There re really not a lot of options, for mens face shine control, so I decided to experiment on this brand. At the begining it was good, but I think our skin get used to it, so the time that this product works just goes down. I can say that if I use it in the morning (06h00 AM), this lasts till 11h00 AM. The product is ok. Weird smell tought.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It gets the job done, however it will NOT last all day. You will definitely need to reapply this lotion multiple times throughout the day to maintain an oil-free complexion. I would highly recommend this, and will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Great smell! I love the smell of this product. And it does an EXCELLENT job at keeping your face oil-free...however, be very very careful when applying this product to your face. If you put on too much, you will have white streaks on your face. This does not bother me before I go to bed, but when applying the lotion prior to work. You need to wait a few minutes until it is dry to see if you are left with any streaks!</li>
            <li> 1 hour later my face was very oily. Defeats the purpose of the product. I did not find it useful.</li>
            <li> Kyoku for Men has many good products and they didn&#x27;t disappoint with this one. It has a great smell when putting it on and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of effort to apply. Right after application I could tell that my face had a great matte look rather the normal oily look that I tend to get. This is great for oil control and lasts me all day without a problem. Only problem is that it works too well to use in the winter. If I use this in the winter my face tends to get dried out. That would be the only downfall but usually my face doesn&#x27;t get oily in the winter due to the dry air anyways. Overall great product that does exactly what it is meant for.</li>
            <li> Keeps shine at bay, but doesn&#x27;t last much; I use it on my bald head and after an hour it was already gone.</li>
            <li> Best Lotion moisturizer for men. My skinn doesnÂ´t look like a greasy bag. I feel so fresh and clean. Best buy for me.</li>
            <li> i have tried other oil control products like nivea for men and it didn&#x27;t work very effective. I saw this product on amazon with also knowing japanese products are very well too. This helped control my shine for almost the whole day..I recommend getting the facial scrub as well..</li>
            <li> Prior to this product, I used clinique men oil control lotion.  But since it was discontinued, I started to use this product. I have been using this product for over six months now (over 4 bottles) and I am loving it!  It does make my face less shiny and less greasy.  It also smells great!  I have a sensitive skin but I am not having any trouble with it.  One drawback of this product is that you have to use more amount of this lotion in order to completely moisturize your skin.  Overall, I love this product and I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because you better check the mirror before you leave the house. It will leave white streaks on your face if you use too much. A dab will do ya. Other than that I can&#x27;t complain. I expect it to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have a normal face with kinda oily nose and forehead area. I bought this to eliminate all oil from my face. Which does happen, if you want to walk around with white marks around your face.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was because of the cold weather and blowing wind, but after I used kyoku&#x27;s exfoliating scrub I applied this product -around pea size- to my nose area and forehead. 5 minutes later i noticed white marks on those areas so I had to rub them away with a little bit of water. Which probably caused the product to wash away because at the end of the day those parts were kinda oily again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s different for very oily skin or maybe it&#x27;s just not for cold and windy climates but when applied to normal face, it leaves white marks. I do not recommend this product If you have normal skin and just want to get rid of the oily nose and forehead part.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very well even if you have oily skin. Not greasy</li>
            <li> This does a good job with toning down the oil and shine of my face.  I wish it lasted longer.  It only works on my face for about 4-5hrs, but everyone doesn&#x27;t have the same complexion, so overall it&#x27;s a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> My husband had used Anthony for Men Oil-Free lotion for years, but we got tired of the price and he&#x27;d never really liked the scent.  So I did some research online and ordered this for him to try.  He loves it.  He says that his skin feels comfortable and not tight when he puts this on after washing his face in the morning or at night, but that it leaves his skin matte and not oily in the T-zone almost all day.  He really likes the very light scent of this one.  And the price is great for how long it lasts... it only takes a little dab, so it doesn&#x27;t get used up too fast.</li>
            <li> Keeps my shiny, oily face, non-shiny, non-oily, and that equals shiny happy people. Smells great and feels great. Much cheaper than purchasing through Grooming Lounge.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Smell and consistency are ok but products leaves an ashy film on skin. Very noticeable on face. It does work in the anti-shine front but not usable as the residual film is very apparent.</li>
            <li> Smells pleasant. Seems to work. Starts a bit oily then dries to matte.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin, so I was not sure if this product would work, but it definitely works as advertised.  It will dry up the oil without drying up your skin, so you don&#x27;t have that sheen all day/night long.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion! I have oily skin and I use this every day and it has helped stop oily skin a lot! I have written a personal review on my blog www.thecasualboardwalk.com check it out!</li>
            <li> For the longest time i&#x27;ve had a shiny/oily face. This is especially apparent when I look at photos of myself - especially those taken toward the end of the day. I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;oil/shine control&amp;#34; lotions from Jack Black, Kiehl&#x27;s, and Anthony. They&#x27;re all decent but none come close to this product. I have to apply it about every 4 hours, so I picked up two bottles; one for home and one for work. It doesn&#x27;t over dry my face, but there is NO oil and NO shine whatsoever. I haven&#x27;t really got my full skin regime figured out yet - I just wash my face daily, tone with Witch Hazel, and this stuff. Gonna get a good mask and some peel-off masks/strips to shrink my pores and I&#x27;ll be all set.</li>
            <li> Absolutely as described and more! Everyone who&#x27;s on the fence try this now! You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> Works really well. Just make sure you are totally dry and also not sweating at all when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review, but I have been so happy with Kyoku products that I was surprised that this one didn&#x27;t deliver.  Make sure your skin is very oily, as this isn&#x27;t something for those who have partially oily skin (like me). Makes my face white as a ghost (even after rubbing into my face for what I feel is a long enough time) and drier and PULLED once it has fully absorbed.  I have to add both a tinted moisturizer and another moisturizer; until that point my skin looks older, drier and worse.  Not buying again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 15 year old son along with the facial scrub and cleanser. has done wonders for his skin. I&#x27;ve tried the scrub and I love it! Leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Really good lotion for oily skin. Helps keeps the shine low.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has extremely oily and sensitive skin. I always try to get him to use my products that are for oil control but he always refused to use them because they were for women.... ya. anyways I found this and thought it would be manly enough for him since it is for men. He had no problems using it and wasn&#x27;t scared of it. Once he puts it on he is oil free all day long! amazing, he also has not had any problems with it breaking him out or causing any irritation. This is really a great product!</li>
            <li> Been using the Kyoku for Men Oil control lotion for years now. A tiny bit goes a long, long way especially if used only on the T-zone (forehead and nose). Nice smooth matte finish that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I understand it&#x27;s most likely difficult to create a product that controls oil while simultaneously moisturizing, but this product is not particularly effective in balancing both tasks.  When first applied, it makes your skin look as though the oil will be controlled, however the effects diminish rather quickly -- within 1 to 2 hours.  If you&#x27;re the type to wash your face and moisturize every hour or two, then this product will work for you.  If you&#x27;re trying to control oil and shine prior to going to work for the day, it will not be as useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency and texture of the lotion itself is also somewhat strange.  It&#x27;s a white-ish lotion that dries on clear, so long as you take extra special care to rub all of it in until it&#x27;s completely dry.  If you fail to do this, it makes that area of your face white.  It is also somewhat tacky.  With other lotions like Oil of Olay, etc., you simply rub it into your face and you&#x27;re done.  With this lotion, it&#x27;s almost imperative to wash your hands after because you have this sticky residue on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you have even the slightest blemish or redness on your face, this seems to magnify the redness.  Since it dries on semi-white, it makes whatever redness you have really pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this wasn&#x27;t worth the price and I am unimpressed.  I&#x27;m giving two stars, however, because it DOES work, just for a very, very short period of time.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I recommend using a moisturizer before so it doesn&#x27;t dry you out. But, if you have super oil skin this stuff will stop the shine all day and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> Works great. A little bit goes a long way. Will definitely be trying more Kyoku products.</li>
            <li> Oil control that goes on and feels oily. No thank you</li>
            <li> Well it definitely sucks up most oils when it comes in contact with the skin but doesn&#x27;t really control anything. It&#x27;s almost the same thing as blotting your face. If you are looking for big control this will not work for you my friends.</li>
            <li> My husband has super oily skin and this stuff helps. My husband uses it all the time.iv also gt very oily skin and it works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Being a naturally oily and greasy man-face; I would have liked this to work and it did in concept but in reality; it created a massive white chalky texture on my face that caused co-workers to believe I had skipped 10 months to the next Halloween holiday party and wanted to look like a clown, but I digress. This stuff doesn&#x27;t work well at all since it just dries up your face like chalk.</li>
            <li> works great for bald head for about an hour then loses its effectiveness.  for the price, not worth it.</li>
            <li> This did not work well at all for me as I had a very serious allergic skin reaction to this product line. However I gave this product line to a friend and he is hooked said able to tell a large difference in the quality of his skin.  He also said he is ging to use this product line from now going forward.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clinique for some time and the oil control for men worked well.  Over a year ago, Clinique dropped this product and since then I tried several products and none of them worked.  I came across the Kyoku accidentally and decided to give it a try after seeing some good reviews.  Well, this product performs very well.  It&#x27;s not oily or sticky like others.  In addition, the price at at the Grooming Lounge just can&#x27;t be beat!  Grooming Lounge also packed the product very well and included a brochure of the men products they are selling.  I plan to order other products from Amazon (Grooming Lounge).</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertised. Barely even moisturizes. Ripoff.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with the product. It doesn&#x27;t mattify your skin and I am yet to experience any reduction in either the production or the appearance of oily skin. I do not recommend purchasing it.</li>
            <li> First of all, I think that this lotion does it job of absorbing oil. The smell is also great! However, everytime I use it, the product seems to be peeling off, not so sure of what was happening? Would anyone enlighten me</li>
            <li> the effect lasts about 2hrs on my face and the bottle is like half air. but it&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
            <li> Got this a few days back - tube was about half empty. Box showed signs of wear and damage. Not impressed. Can&#x27;t return it apparently. Contacted Amazon to report the situation. Looks like old stock that either evaporated or they are selling refurbished lotion, or they just fill up their product half way, kick it around a bit when in the box, and s *** it on over to the consumer. Either way, not bloody good.</li>
            <li> this is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and I intend to order more in the future! I have very oily skin on my facial area and I used products that I&#x27;ve bought from other retail stores. but this is the first product which does an excellent job!. And last for several hours</li>
            <li> I am using this with the Pore Reducing Serum. It is definitely non greasy. My face feels moisturized but not oily. I have ordered a second bottle and plan to keep using it. Check our the Lava Masque. It does an excellent job also.</li>
            <li> works great and best price around</li>
            <li> It does work but it has a strong smell - I did not find it pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Just be careful to look at your face a few minutes after you apply it. If you put too much on, you&#x27;ll leave white film on your face as it dries, particularly when temps are cold. I sometimes put a thin layer of moisturizer on, then top of it off with this lotion. It sounds contradictory, but it works for me. My face is moisturized, but it doesn&#x27;t look oily at all. I&#x27;ll see how this works when my face is more oily in 100-degree temps in the summer.</li>
            <li> Everybody has different skin so you have to try it for yourself. For me it doesn&#x27;t work. Perhaps because I have a darker complexion, it leaves a very visible gloss (not shiny but glossy). I&#x27;ve tried other mattifying products as well and none of them work. The only real solution is to use a blotting film. That&#x27;s the one thing that DOES work.</li>
            <li> Works well for 4-5 hours</li>
            <li> I tried this product coming from Clinique M-gel lotion to try something different and it is OK. It sometimes leaves your face a lighter shade. It&#x27;s not greasy but I think I&#x27;m going back to the other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dry and oily skin for some time now.  I&#x27;ve found great moisturizers in the past that got rid of my dry skin, but half way through the day I look like I&#x27;ve broken out into a sweat.  I&#x27;m in a wheelchair and have trouble lifting my hands up to wipe my face off; there&#x27;s nothing quite as bad as knowing you&#x27;re shiny and not being able to do anything about it.  Enter the Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion.  I put it on at about 9 AM and it&#x27;s now 8:51 PM....still no shine! I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from oil skin.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really mattify but its a good oil control lotion and its a good smell too... Goes on easily and not a lot is required. Over all good but not great because I was looking for something that would also have a slight matte effect  as in take away the shine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months, and I still use it everyday because it does a good job moisturizing my face. It doesn&#x27;t keep my face oil-free for as long as I would like it too (my face gets oily after about an hour after putting this on). The reason I keep using it is because it is light, yet moisturizing. It also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on your face like other moisturizers. I will keep using it until I find something better.</li>
            <li> I have a normal skin type, which is not shiny after being cleansed. After using kyoku daily facial cleaner and the kyoku scrub in the morning, I applied a pea-sized amount of this oil-control lotion, lightly covering my neck and face. It absorbed easily, but already looked a little bit shiny. As the day wore on, the lotion did nothing to control excess oil. By lunchtime, just wiping my finger over my forehead left my finger looking glossy. Basically, it does not work.</li>
            <li> Dry skin that gets too oily when I use moisturizer so I thought this would be nice to add after a moisturizer but it doesn&#x27;t work too well for me.</li>
            <li> my face gets pretty dry in the cold weather but I also have a oily skin  so trying to find something to help me out with both is kind of tough in this product does a pretty good job of that</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderfully clean and fresh.  It moisturizes without feeling heavy.  As others have mentioned, you really need to be sure to rub it in and you really don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Within an hour of applying it, my face is oily again. It does have a pleasant smell and goes on easily. It just doesn&#x27;t last long for me.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes without causing your face to look oily! Also, this product keeps your face from that oily shine that can develop over the course of a warm day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This produce delivers exactly what it promises. I thought Clinique poor minimized (original) formula was the best. Kooky blows Clinique out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, the citrus scent is very pleasant and I strongly urge you to buy this for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides Super oil control, plus needed non greasy moisturizing in one puts this in a class of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to apply to a clean face immediately after washing and patting dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t rub your face with a towel! It will make you oily when you do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tap the product on, DO NOT rub it into the skin.  It sits on the skin in a thin layer and will absorb like crazy- you will be amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also recommending you scrub to exfoliate ONLY at bedtime, and gently wash your face in the morning, to inhibit the pores from pumping out oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the day, blot with a paper towel IF you need to, OR if you can find them, use the large tissue paper toilet seat liners found in a lot of public restrooms.  Blotting &#x3D; press the paper on your face and LIFT IT OFF. DO NOTRUB. That just spreads the oil. Same technique when applying powder- pat, don&#x27;t rub ðŸ˜€&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your $ on blotting papers.  If you like a small blotting sheet, go to a beauty superstore and purchase JUMBO PERM wrapped papers.  You get a large packet, ~ a couple HUNDRED for a little $, and they are identical to the insanely priced &#x27;facial&#x27; blotters. (You are welcome in advance :-) ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002NV7NDQ Kyoku for Men Oil Control Lotion, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]]have never tried Kyoku, but I am very please with the extremely high quality of this product. Well packaged and controls facial oil.</li>
            <li> I personally have fairly oily skin.  I can easily go through 2 or 3 absorbing sheets a day.  So I was looking for something I could add into my morning regimen to help out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this stuff has a pleasant menthol like smell, and works okay as a general facial lotion, it did little or nothing to control the oil.  Worst part was, it leaves an almost tacky film on your skin.  Something like a very light facial peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found other products that are more effective for half the price.  I would not suggest this product for oil control.  Would return, but non-returnable.  So now I am stuck with a $20 bottle of worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE 11/15/2012***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have continued to use this lotion for a few months now instead of just tossing it out.  Still does hardly anything to control facial oil.  Results may last for an hour at best.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for a very convenient price. Recommended</li>
            <li> Aside from from being a great moisturizer, it really lives up to its claims of oil control.  That is the main reason I used it.  A word of caution: look in the mirror before leaving the house.  It you use too much of it, it can dry leaving white streaks on your face.  If this happens, just apply a few drops of water to your face and rub off the white streaks.  Even with its shortcomings, I love it.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference between this and regular, non oil control lotion.</li>
            <li> it does work nicely. but i don&#x27;t feel like it lasts that long. maybe just a couple of hours. not to bad though</li>
            <li> Works on me for about 2 hours then my skin starts getting oily again. Do not know if it is my skin or the cream that is the problem</li>
            <li> It is oily as any other regular cream, not as near as oily skin cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed and will stick with Garnier, Loreal and all the other known companies.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT CONTROL OILY SKIN AS DESCRIBED ON PRODUCT INFO???  GIVE ME A BREAK!!  THIS ITEM SUCKS!!!  PLAIN AND SIMPLE...THIS ITEM DOESN&#x27;T CONTROL OILY SKIN AS IT ADVERTISES!!</li>
            <li> This lotion simply doesn&#x27;t work as well and others I have tried. I felt like the residue was more oily than what my face normally is. There are other mattifiers that work much better and don&#x27;t leave your face oily after application.</li>
            <li> This item works well but it seems to be hit or miss, as odd as it sounds, sometimes it works to reduce the oils, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, but if you are looking for a matted lotion this is one I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I never used this brand before but after reading review, i decide to try it. It does control oil on my t-zone. works great. no more oily shiny looks..</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a residue but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like many other creams. It also makes the skin look hydrated. The downfall would be an amount you have to put because of the density.</li>
            <li> easy to use and does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want fancy products but only simply things for men, this is it.</li>
            <li> Works great controlling oily skin plus it smells good. The tube is small for the price but you dont need much to cover your face and your getting premium quality.</li>
            <li> I did receive my products and has no problem with it thank you</li>
            <li> A lot of people had success with this according to Amazon reviews as well as a few other sources. It didn&#x27;t work for me however. What did work was Cetaphil dermacontrol moisturizer with SPF</li>
            <li> Product does not work for me.  Skin is oily within 2 hours of application.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used to reduce the shine on my face. My skin is clearer and far less oily. Love Kyoku for Men!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something to replace the Clarins Men Shine Free gel that was discontinued a year or two ago.  I spent a lot of money trying to find something that worked as well.  I have a really oily face AND I live in the tropics where humidity is 80-90% year-round.  At first, I didn&#x27;t think this worked that well.  It helped control my oil for about 2-3 hours which wasn&#x27;t that great.  Then I started using the Kyoku Pore Reducing Serum BEFORE I put this on.  I use very little of both--about 1/3 of a pea-size amount.  It works very well  now.  It controls my oil for about 4-5 hours (that&#x27;s the best someone with an oily facial complexion can expect in the tropics) and it keeps my face looking fresh.  I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re both that expensive.  I think the price has come down a lot since others posted about it because when I saw the price I thought it was very cheap.  In response to those that said it left them with a chalky texture I would say they probably used too much.  I use very little and don&#x27;t notice any chalkiness at all.  I&#x27;m glad I finally found something that works for me.</li>
            <li> is working very well already and i&#x27;ve only had it one day</li>
            <li> I like a lot of Kyoku products but this one left my skin extremely dry. It&#x27;s supposed to hydrate but it strips all the moisture from your skin.</li>
            <li> Started using this and now I&#x27;m pulling mad tail bro!</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and this really helped. Plus, it&#x27;s a lotion so I don&#x27;t feel like a girl putting it on.</li>
            <li> This was one of the better mattifier type lotions that I have purchased.  I have very oily/shinny skin and this really helps.  It lasts about 5-6 hours and I have had no issues with breakouts or other skin issues after using it.  Have to be careful not to use too much and to spread it evenly as you can get the white powder appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is usually half or less of the others I have tried.  This is my go to mattifier for now.</li>
            <li> Does not really extinguish the shine....smells great though!</li>
            <li> Though I shouldnt be surprised, I recently purchased the Kyoku pre electric shave and was very happy with the quality, smell and the fact the product just did what it claimed to do. Usually products come close, but dont fulfill exactly as promised.  This oil control lotion is one that does just what it says.  It softens without being greasy or oily.  Very pleasing smell.  I am bald and use it on my whole face and head, as shaving dries out my head.  This lotion makes it smooth and been told by girls that love to rub bald heads, feels great.  So thumbs up, 5 stars, ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
