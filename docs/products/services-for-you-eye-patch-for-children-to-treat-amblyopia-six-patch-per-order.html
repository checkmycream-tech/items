            <li>This works well I can reuse them its so much better then</li>
            <li>This is way better than putting a patch on your eye.</li>
            <li>Love the product and the quantity of the pack.</li>
            <li>I could make these myself so easily.</li>

            <li>light sensitivity and weakness.</li>
            <li>Eye patches work and they fit well</li>
            <li>My granddaughter is wearing these and they are better than the one&#x27;s that you place directly on the skin.</li>
            <li>order quite a lot from Amazon so it would be nice to have english on the box :</li>
            <li>He would wear the patch over his glasses so he can still watch TV with his good eye and to let his other eye rest.</li>
            <li>These little patches are perfect for little ones they are simple but not unattractive and in case have been very durable what more can you ask for :)</li>
            <li>this patch is not fully covered resulting more gaps under and above the patch and that will not help.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first thing she looks for is the patch.</li>
            <li>-)&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more and  I hope to get the cartoon designs next time, this came without</li>

            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>

            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>We have done eye patches before, surgery next month &amp; this is the easiest most durable one so far.</li>
            <li>Here is what the seller will tell you:  &amp;#34;The products are in the AMAZON warehouse,If you reorder it ,the pads is some cute animal prints or fruit or other pictures or</li>
            <li>It is good for a little extra patch time in the morning before school when my daughter doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time to wear her patch.  </li>
            <li>They are much less bulky than other over the glasses patches we&#x27;ve used which makes them more comfortable for my son.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as decorative as other patches, but it is comfortable and functional and my son doesn&#x27;t mind wearing it.</li>
            <li>This patch is less irritating to my son because his glad still fit on like normal,  but it compelling blocks his vision like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>, wide  enough it wraps around the side to block side light</li>
            <li>Most comfortable patch for my little ones small face!</li>
            <li>I bought these eye patches for my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li>Besides these last much longer, the other ones I tried lost their hold very fast.  </li>
            <li>The pirate patch was uncomfortable and too hot to keep it on for more than 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>very reasonably priced according to the other brands.  </li>
            <li>Helped with my 4 year old to actually keep the eye patch on without it being directly on the face.</li>
            <li>At 6 years old its not a good fit</li>
            <li>My 8 year old patches for 1-2 hours a day and the sticky disposable patches were starting to irritate his skin.</li>
            <li>When I found out we needed to patch my 3 yr old&#x27;s eyes for an hour a day, alternating back and forth for extropia, I was concerned how we would get him to cooperate.  </li>
            <li>The only eye patch I could find that my 3 year old daughter can wear with her glasses.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that only Chinese writing on the box.</li>

            <li> We had problems getting my 7 year old granddaughter to wear any of the other patches</li>
            <li> It is going to last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The decorations are lame (just a sticker that easily comes off)</li>
            <li> , she was afraid that it was going to pull her eye brows off her skin :).</li>
            <li> We just put the black part on the outside so he would see the blue.</li>
            <li> The other three patches were blank.</li>
            <li> They have very long eyelashes</li>
            <li> My kids used to ask me a whole time when they can take them off, and it was very hard to keep it on as long as they needed it.  </li>
            <li> The sticky eye patches hurt her when removed and the padded eye patch either didn&#x27;t fit under her glasses, or uncomfortably pushed her glasses down on her face when worn over them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thankfully all 6 patches were plain blue with no icon in the center as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple and work well.</li>
            <li> The only complaint was that his long eyelashes rubbed on them.  </li>
            <li> our son was not comfortable with the other sticker based eye patch., but then this is of no good as it doesn&#x27;t server the real purpose.</li>
            <li> They are not super fancy, but they do the trick!</li>
            <li> , which is to have his lazy eye become healthier.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to position the patch in such a way that it does no rub up against my child&#x27;s nose and irritate her.  </li>
            <li> quality was same..Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> but the stitching is bad like it&#x27;s out of a chinese sweat shop.  </li>
            <li> The sticky ones were really not good for my kids.  </li>
            <li> and let&#x27;s the weak eye get stronger.  </li>
            <li> My 5yr old hated patching.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son hated to wear the stick-on bandage-type eye patches and wouldn&#x27;t keep on the elastic band patches either.  </li>
            <li> Since the patch is thin</li>
            <li> and it was extremely uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> blank.the pictures is random from the manufacturers.</li>
            <li> he got into a bad motorcycle accident and sustained head injuries...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Will not recommend this product for kids for the treatment of Amblyopia, coz. this patch is not fully covered resulting more gaps under and above the patch and that will not help.&lt;br /&gt;-We earlier considered to use this coz. our son was not comfortable with the other sticker based eye patch., but then this is of no good as it doesn&#x27;t server the real purpose., which is to have his lazy eye become healthier.</li>
            <li> My 5yr old hated patching. Especially the one that you stick on your eye, she was afraid that it was going to pull her eye brows off her skin :). The pirate patch was uncomfortable and too hot to keep it on for more than 20 to 30 minutes. It was always a struggle asking her to wear the patch, that&#x27;s when i found this patch on Amazon and she absolutely loves it. She has been using it for about 3 months now and I dont have to remind her. As soon as she is home the first thing she looks for is the patch. Sturdy product. It comes in a pack ok 4 or 6. It is going to last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Great option for patching. This patch is less irritating to my son because his glad still fit on like normal,  but it compelling blocks his vision like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old patches for 1-2 hours a day and the sticky disposable patches were starting to irritate his skin. These work great on his glasses. The decorations are lame (just a sticker that easily comes off) but my son doesn&#x27;t care what it looks like. I told him he could decorate it himself but he hasn&#x27;t wanted to at this point. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Most comfortable patch for my little ones small face! I sewed buttons, cute patches, and embroidered them for decoration.</li>
            <li> We had problems getting my 7 year old granddaughter to wear any of the other patches but she doesn&#x27;t mind wearing this with her glasses on.  Great idea, thanks</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son hated to wear the stick-on bandage-type eye patches and wouldn&#x27;t keep on the elastic band patches either.  But he will wear this patch on his glasses!  He says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;awesome!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These work great!!  My daughter is four and these fit over her glasses perfectly!  They are not super fancy, but they do the trick!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is wearing these and they are better than the one&#x27;s that you place directly on the skin. I could make these myself so easily. Thanks</li>
            <li> When I found out we needed to patch my 3 yr old&#x27;s eyes for an hour a day, alternating back and forth for extropia, I was concerned how we would get him to cooperate.  I ordered these and the sticky patches.  I am so glad I gave these a chance.  He is nearsighted, and these slip easily on over his glasses.  The patch extends over the side as well.  I do not think we would have gotten him to keep the stickers on, but these patches make it very easy.  It has only been a week, but it is going well.</li>
            <li> We have done eye patches before, surgery next month &amp; this is the easiest most durable one so far.</li>
            <li> I have a little girl who temporarily has to wear this item and she HATES it so much.  All that means is, it is working like it is suppose too.</li>
            <li> they look really Cheap and quality was same..Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> This works well I can reuse them its so much better then the bandaid kind..At 6 years old its not a good fit and it almost took off his skin when I removed it......&lt;br /&gt;So I bought these. I was surprised that only Chinese writing on the box. Nothing in English after opening and removing from package I figured out what I had.......&lt;br /&gt;I order quite a lot from Amazon so it would be nice to have english on the box :-)&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more and  I hope to get the cartoon designs next time, this came without</li>
            <li> These are the best fitting patches I found and best value.  Thankfully all 6 patches were plain blue with no icon in the center as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li> Great eye patch to use after surgery, wide  enough it wraps around the side to block side light</li>
            <li> very reasonably priced according to the other brands.  I liked it better than the others with pictures.  Those were overdone, and much more expensive,  Besides these last much longer, the other ones I tried lost their hold very fast.  The sticky ones were really not good for my kids.  They have very long eyelashes and it was extremely uncomfortable.  My kids used to ask me a whole time when they can take them off, and it was very hard to keep it on as long as they needed it.  Now, with these, my kids forget to take them off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with these. Six patches came in the box. They are much less bulky than other over the glasses patches we&#x27;ve used which makes them more comfortable for my son. The inside of the patch is textured and grips to the glasses so they stay put, and it wraps around the arm. Since the patch is thin it&#x27;s easy to trim for a good fit around the nose. This isn&#x27;t as decorative as other patches, but it is comfortable and functional and my son doesn&#x27;t mind wearing it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it came on time and it fits my son&#x27;s glasses perfectly without any problems.  Will purchase more in the future</li>
            <li> Slides back and forth on the lens.</li>
            <li> I needed a patch that did not stick on my 5 year olds skin.  This patch will not cover the space between the glasses and eye which still lets the child use peripheral vision.  The point of wearing this is so the patched eye does not see anything and let&#x27;s the weak eye get stronger.  This does not do the job.  I did find another patch that works great,  [...]  You give the measurements of the glasses lens to cover and it works great!!</li>
            <li> These little patches are perfect for little ones they are simple but not unattractive and in case have been very durable what more can you ask for :)</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my husband..he got into a bad motorcycle accident and sustained head injuries...he thankfully got through it but was having problems with his eye...light sensitivity and weakness. He would wear the patch over his glasses so he can still watch TV with his good eye and to let his other eye rest. This is a great product..very happy with it! We just put the black part on the outside so he would see the blue.</li>
            <li> Really good product.  Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The only eye patch I could find that my 3 year old daughter can wear with her glasses. The sticky eye patches hurt her when removed and the padded eye patch either didn&#x27;t fit under her glasses, or uncomfortably pushed her glasses down on her face when worn over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These eye patches eliminate all of those problems. They give you six, but you really only need one. I suppose the extras are nice in case one gets lost. Came with one Hello Kitty patch and two Minnie Mouse patches. The other three patches were blank.</li>
            <li> It does not look the same like the picture but it is good price. My daughter like it. It is comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought these eye patches for my 3 year old.  It is difficult to position the patch in such a way that it does no rub up against my child&#x27;s nose and irritate her.  I often need to re-position it since my child will move the patch and start to see &amp;#34;around it&amp;#34; which defeats the purpose of patching.</li>
            <li> These are perfect!! Blocks side and frontal view,  great for kids!</li>
            <li> I bought them for my 6-year-old daughter. The patches serve their purposes. However, be prepared to receive all blank patches as I did. Here is what the seller will tell you:  &amp;#34;The products are in the AMAZON warehouse,If you reorder it ,the pads is some cute animal prints or fruit or other pictures or blank.the pictures is random from the manufacturers. or you can add some pictures by yourself.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not a big problem, so I will keep the blank patches and let my daughter decorate them with her stickers.</li>
            <li> On the photo it looks well made but the stitching is bad like it&#x27;s out of a chinese sweat shop.  The material hurts your eye lashes and it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job covering your eye either.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great. This is way better than putting a patch on your eye. My daughter wears it with no complaints.</li>
            <li> Eye patches work and they fit well but it said 6 pack and there were only 4 in the box.</li>
            <li> He liked them better than the adhesive patches.  The only complaint was that his long eyelashes rubbed on them.  Plain and simple and work well.</li>
            <li> It is good for a little extra patch time in the morning before school when my daughter doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time to wear her patch.  Because she can wear it again and again, we aren&#x27;t wasting money by using extra adhesive patches.  But she doesn&#x27;t like the way it feels and she can peek out the corner.</li>
            <li> The product works as well as I thought it would. Helped with my 4 year old to actually keep the eye patch on without it being directly on the face. Which others would cause discomfort, sweating and lack of patch time. This one can be kept on the glasses and slid to the side when not in use for short relief. Love the product and the quantity of the pack.</li>
            <li> Very awesome eye patch for my daughter. It fits perfectly on her glasses.</li>
