            <li>Nice nails.  </li>
            <li>I can buy these at target for around 8 bucks, but its nice to have them delivered to my door for another 2 bucks.</li>
            <li>Love this and seller got them to me</li>
            <li>I am very happy about the quality of these nails, love the look, mostly of the Pearl White ones, and I save a lot of money!</li>
            <li>They look better than the Salon Nails and they are safer in case of mechanic accidents...</li>
            <li>Wish they had more nails.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also easy to remove when you want them off.</li>
            <li>I am just changing them every one, or second month, or when they fall, and I am cleaning the natural nail and the fallen nail w/ an electric file, treat them w/ alcohol and tea tree oil to disinfect, and am good to go another month! :-)</li>
            <li>These nails looked very nice, they aren&#x27;t to long.</li>
            <li>quick will order again</li>

            <li>Price was reasonable if they last the full week I will now be doing my nails at home for a fraction of the cost I use to spend on acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting Nailene Quick glue to set them, because the gel glue that comes with them does not hold and fall off after only one day.</li>
            <li>Just got these they are pretty with the pearl French manicure</li>
            <li>I had salon acrylic nails, but did not like the damage to my natural nails.</li>

            <li>They look like salon nails, very natural and last a couple of weeks without chipping.</li>

            <li> Love this and seller got them to me quick will order again</li>
            <li> Love Kiss Nails!!! I changed the Solon Nail sessions with these DIY nails... I am very happy about the quality of these nails, love the look, mostly of the Pearl White ones, and I save a lot of money! They look better than the Salon Nails and they are safer in case of mechanic accidents... I am just changing them every one, or second month, or when they fall, and I am cleaning the natural nail and the fallen nail w/ an electric file, treat them w/ alcohol and tea tree oil to disinfect, and am good to go another month! :-)</li>
            <li> after some practice applyin them they have lasted up to 2 week-salon nails have to b be done that often</li>
            <li> love having my nail kits on hand!</li>
            <li> LOVE these!!!! I am not a huge fan of press on style nails, but these are as close to nail salon style/look that you can get!&lt;br /&gt;They look real!! I am buying another pack or... more!!!&lt;br /&gt;My daughters LOVE them too! We fight over them, LOL! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Delivered on time excellent product</li>
            <li> great fit  to natural nail lasts a long time</li>

            <li> Nice nails.  Just want to mention they were a pearl (shimmer) white.  I didn&#x27;t see that in the description, so thought others would like that info.</li>
            <li> Just got these they are pretty with the pearl French manicure I will be posting an update on how long they will stay on as I just put them on today and all the nails fit nicely and my hands are pretty small. Overall looks like I had my nails done in a salon. Very pleased so far and shipping was fast. Price was reasonable if they last the full week I will now be doing my nails at home for a fraction of the cost I use to spend on acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Excellent &amp;#34;fakes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These are great.  Wish they had more nails.</li>
            <li> These Kiss nails are very easy to apply! The kit consist of everything you need and directions even though you probably won&#x27;t need them. They last pretty long also.. Around 2-3 weeks for me. After exploring options I have also noticed they make colored ones to! :D one HAPPY girl!</li>
            <li> These nails looked very nice, they aren&#x27;t to long. The shape was very nice. I was very pleased with the result, best nail product that I have purchased. The only down side is after a couple of days the nails will start to fall off. No biggy though you can reapply it with the nail glue that&#x27;s included!</li>
            <li> These are the only brand of DIY fake nails I will buy. There are a variety of sizes to fit any nail, and they last me usually between 3 and 4 days. They&#x27;re also easy to remove when you want them off. It says not to peel them off, but after a couple of days I can clip them short, and peel them off from the sides. Comes with a nail file and a cuticle thingy. I can buy these at target for around 8 bucks, but its nice to have them delivered to my door for another 2 bucks. recommend.</li>
