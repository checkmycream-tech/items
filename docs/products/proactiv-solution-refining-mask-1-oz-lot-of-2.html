    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have since learned that tea tree oil, an ingredient in this mask, is a wonderful acne treatment.  </li>
            <li>We fight over it so its great to have additional tubes!</li>
            <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t work over night, but after about two nights of wearing it as a spot treatment, it works awesomely!</li>
            <li>I have switched to natures cure and its wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I have this again in my arsenal.</li>
            <li>But Yeah, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>Everyone explained that this mask was a great addition to their beauty routine.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for pimples that sprout up overnight.</li>
            <li>I also use it myself when and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It really is great for breakouts and keeping them away.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Good for blackheads and shrinking pores on the nose area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this product because It clears my skin up and it smells good.</li>
            <li>During this time I used it as an overnight spot treatment as it indicates it is good for.</li>
            <li>Also I like the fact you get two tubes at a good price.</li>
            <li>So am happy to find more at a good price.</li>
            <li>This is one of our favorite all-time skincare products!</li>
            <li>Love this refining mask!</li>
            <li>And the great thing is this stuff is pretty cheap too!!!</li>
            <li>It was a great deal with the offer of buy one get one free</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.    </li>
            <li>Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good reason why this product sells, has celebrity endorsements, is costly, and is offered in so many Kiosks and infomercials.</li>
            <li>It reduced pimples faster and more effectively than anything I&#x27;d ever seen.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more effective for acutual pimples.</li>
            <li>it is pleasant to the touch, has a nice creamy consistency and cleans pores very well.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for more than 20 minutes, but you can leave it on overnight too.</li>
            <li>But having it again, I realize why it gave me so many fond memories.  </li>
            <li>Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li>This is a much better option and I am glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Appreciate your business and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love this product it dries up your acne and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Just need to make sure and use a moisturizer</li>
            <li>Rather than my skin clearing up, I have more pimples on my face now than I did before I started using the product.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the refining mask.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love all Proactive products.</li>
            <li>Dries the skin to the point you get more acne.</li>
            <li>I love them both</li>
            <li>Love the way my face feels after I was this refining mask off.</li>
            <li>Feels better if you leave on over night.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product - much better than the $260 product the Dermatoligist prescribed.  </li>
            <li>Beware, all sulfur-based masks are very drying, despite being good cleansing agents.</li>
            <li>The sulfur smell is a bit strong, my husband smell it after I had already wash it off</li>
            <li>This mask is light and creamy, you might think it doesn&#x27;t work, but it does.</li>
            <li>I need to use something that is both effective but gentle.</li>
            <li>It makes my pimples disappear and my face smooth.</li>
            <li>The price of natures cure is more reasonable and it works better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s right around the corner, but I still do get a blemish or two once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and it worked great!  </li>
            <li>this stuff is great to put on spots of acne to clear it up fast</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used for a fast and easy method of getting rid of a pimple or black head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used it as a full mask.</li>
            <li>Good price and works well on those red spots that always seam to pop up when I&#x27;ve got someting planned.  </li>
            <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even 20 and 30% Salicylic Acid treatments aren&#x27;t as quick in reducing blemishes as this.</li>
            <li>But I ordered what I needed and it came quickly and no questions asked.</li>
            <li>In addition to this, my acne scars darkened tremendously.</li>
            <li>Its very strong so dont get it near your eyes.</li>
            <li>But it really works!!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product upon reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 years old and assumed that entering my 30&#x27;s would be more about age defying products.</li>
            <li>By morning, it&#x27;s 90% gone---but most of the time it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li>This one truly lives up to my skins expectations and my own personal expectations.</li>
            <li>I stock pile this stuff up, so worth the money</li>
            <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li>Great Small Size...</li>
            <li>Back in the day when I used to use the Proactiv system, I got this little mask for free and I loved it!  </li>
            <li>It really does work wonders!  </li>
            <li>But for the effects, I&#x27;m willing to put up with the smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li>I will be reordering very soon!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>*: When I get a blemish, I literally dab on a bit of this cream right on top of the pimple, and allow it to dry.</li>
            <li>it is significantly reduced or nearly gone by the morning when you use this.</li>
            <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li>It works every time on problematic skin issues acne clears right up in a day or two â™¡ I highly recommend this during that time of the month</li>
            <li>over time, if you just use it on your whole face and sleep in it at night as a mask, it clears up your whole face.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the shipping was faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but this really helps reduce my acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>, I Wouldn&#x27;t Lie Like These Other Customers :)</li>
            <li>your site is very afforable an reliable i highly recormend</li>
            <li>and I have not broken out with any new pimples since.</li>
            <li>Instead of having pimples for a week or so the mask reduces the timeframe by more than half.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough on the skin but really does get rid of pimples fast!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying it from Proactiv directly too!</li>
            <li>For 1 month, I combined the High Frequency apparatus with 3 steps Proactive along with Proactive refining masks.</li>
            <li>Feel a breakout coming through your skin and dab a little of this on, its magic.</li>
            <li>Love this product iv been useing proactiv for few years now.</li>
            <li>I felt as though this was a knock-off as it was not the normal consistency.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li>They are new and not expired.</li>
            <li>Plus, this seller offers prices WAY under market value!</li>
            <li>having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it took a month or so to clear up my face and ever since then I have never broke out like that again.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>BUT... do not order directly from Proactive online.  </li>
            <li>and I wasnt even near him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for occasional use with my sensitive skin even though the other proactiv products cause irritation if I use them.</li>
            <li>I had a few new pimples when I received this item (luckily, so I could try it out)</li>
            <li>I just bought some for the first time in years after trying a slew of other products and after just two applications</li>
            <li>I figured that was simply because it would take some time to clear up my face.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive like mines ,I would only use this twice a week.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my breakouts would dry up, but they would not go away completely.</li>

            <li> I noticed that my breakouts would dry up, but they would not go away completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get it again -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask for 10 years, tried other masks and still come back to this.</li>
            <li> causes my skin to dry out.</li>
            <li> Sticky Nd Dry...</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed</li>
            <li> You only need to apply a little bit of the product too</li>
            <li> I have to be careful what products I use on my skin.</li>
            <li> except that I had gotten other products by then and was trying those out.  </li>

            <li> I use this on individual pimples.  I put it on at night and wash off the next morning.  It works.  I&#x27;ve never used it as a full mask.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from amazon and already use the proactiv system from the proactiv company and it works for me. The package came with 2 tubes of the 1 oz refining mask. They are new and not expired. Also, under the cap is still sealed.     This mask is light and creamy, you might think it doesn&#x27;t work, but it does. I leave it on for more than 20 minutes, but you can leave it on overnight too. My skin glows after washing it off my face. Good for blackheads and shrinking pores on the nose area.</li>
            <li> Back in the day when I used to use the Proactiv system, I got this little mask for free and I loved it!  It reduced pimples faster and more effectively than anything I&#x27;d ever seen.  But when I stopped using the entire system, I didn&#x27;t even try to get this again as I figured it would be too expensive and I thought I could find something cheaper and easier to get.      Well, now this item is cheaper and easier to get and I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get it again - except that I had gotten other products by then and was trying those out.  But having it again, I realize why it gave me so many fond memories.  It really does work wonders!  I had a few new pimples when I received this item (luckily, so I could try it out) and after applying it as a mask and as a spot-on treatment and leaving it overnight, I noticed that not only did it reduce those pimples, it also reduced this wouldn&#x27;t-die pimple I had for at least 6 weeks, as well as an under-the-skin, just-starting-to-hurt and stretch-the-skin pimple, and it lightened my existing blemishes.  I was thrilled.    I have since learned that tea tree oil, an ingredient in this mask, is a wonderful acne treatment.  If this is what it does, it definitely is.    The only problem I have with this product is the smell.  I couldn&#x27;t pin it down and then I realized, it&#x27;s the sulfur.  But for the effects, I&#x27;m willing to put up with the smell.  You only need to apply a little bit of the product too so I think it will last a while.  I&#x27;m so happy I have this again in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> The Refining mask is such a life saver..I&#x27;ve always loved this product because It clears my skin up and it smells good. When you wash it off it has this sulferic smell to it..But Yeah, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Do use all three components of the set if you can. Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li> Despite the price, I would recommend this Sulfur-containing mask, b/c it is pleasant to the touch, has a nice creamy consistency and cleans pores very well. Beware, all sulfur-based masks are very drying, despite being good cleansing agents. I once tried a Mint-Julep sulfur mask that I purchased at Walgreens and the consistency and color of that mask made it unpleasant to use. This is a much better option and I am glad I gave it a try. Will be re-purchasing after I finish my current bottle.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, combination skin. I have to be careful what products I use on my skin. With Proactiv, I can only use the Deep Cleansing wash. The basic was (white cleanser) causes my skin to dry out. The Deep Cleansing Wash (blue cleanser, meant for entire body also), includes added moisturizers that my skin tolerates. I need to use something that is both effective but gentle. I use this specific product to get rid of problem breakouts. I&#x27;m 32 years old and assumed that entering my 30&#x27;s would be more about age defying products. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s right around the corner, but I still do get a blemish or two once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**GREAT TIP**: When I get a blemish, I literally dab on a bit of this cream right on top of the pimple, and allow it to dry. I leave it on overnight. By morning, it&#x27;s 90% gone---but most of the time it&#x27;s completely gone. This is a terrific product. There&#x27;s a good reason why this product sells, has celebrity endorsements, is costly, and is offered in so many Kiosks and infomercials. This one truly lives up to my skins expectations and my own personal expectations. I will be reordering very soon!</li>
            <li> of all the proactive products,this one works. I can put it on a pimple, leave it on overnight, and the next morning the pimple is significantly smaller or gone. It works. over time, if you just use it on your whole face and sleep in it at night as a mask, it clears up your whole face. I have oily, somewhat acne prone skin, and the proactive system itself did not work. But this mask, after cleansing with a salicyclic OTC face wash and sleeping in it nightly, literally cleared up my entire face.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle worker. Even 20 and 30% Salicylic Acid treatments aren&#x27;t as quick in reducing blemishes as this. I stock pile this stuff up, so worth the money</li>
            <li> I bought the ProActive refining mask off Amazon about a month ago. I love this product and the shipping was faster than I expected. It was a great deal with the offer of buy one get one free so I couldnt pass it up. It makes my pimples disappear and my face smooth. I will def buy this product when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product - much better than the $260 product the Dermatoligist prescribed.  BUT... do not order directly from Proactive online.  You will automatically be put in a club and they when send you products that you didn&#x27;t order and charge your credit card.  I will continue to order from Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> Good price and works well on those red spots that always seam to pop up when I&#x27;ve got someting planned.  It&#x27;s fine for occasional use with my sensitive skin even though the other proactiv products cause irritation if I use them.</li>
            <li> The proactiv representative didn&#x27;t want to help me with this when I called to receive this product unless I bought the kit which I already had. But I ordered what I needed and it came quickly and no questions asked. Appreciate your business and will be ordering more. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product it dries up your acne and blemishes.  Dont use it everyday cause it dries up your skin a lot.  But it really works!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product as a mask but as a acne spot treatment. Feel a breakout coming through your skin and dab a little of this on, its magic. Or even can use it after you messed up a zit by trying to pop it, and this stuff will heal your breakout in a day...almost a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Almost overnight! Just need to make sure and use a moisturizer otherwise it will overdry your skin</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product upon reading the positive reviews. Everyone explained that this mask was a great addition to their beauty routine. However I found the opposite. The first time I used it  I noticed that my breakouts would dry up, but they would not go away completely. I figured that was simply because it would take some time to clear up my face. So I upped my usage from one time per week to three times per week. During this time I used it as an overnight spot treatment as it indicates it is good for. Rather than my skin clearing up, I have more pimples on my face now than I did before I started using the product. In addition to this, my acne scars darkened tremendously. I stopped using it about 2 weeks ago and I have not broken out with any new pimples since.</li>
            <li> Although the mask can be a little difficult to remove once dry, it does wonders for the onset of pimples by drying it out and minimizing it. Instead of having pimples for a week or so the mask reduces the timeframe by more than half. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is one of our favorite all-time skincare products! Cannot keep it around. We fight over it so its great to have additional tubes!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on my zits! As soon as I see one starting to show I dab some on and let it sit and it helps it not be so obvious.</li>
            <li> I have used proactiv products in the past and I can say this is the only thing I like.All the other proactive products are to harsh for my skin but this really helps reduce my acne breakouts.The sulfur smell is a bit strong, my husband smell it after I had already wash it off and I wasnt even near him.So I would recommend using this at night.Also use a sunscreen doing the day to prevent discoloration.If your skin is sensitive like mines ,I would only use this twice a week.Also I like the fact you get two tubes at a good price.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great to put on spots of acne to clear it up fast</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv since last Summer.  it took a month or so to clear up my face and ever since then I have never broke out like that again.  I will have pimples here and there but not nothing like I used to.  I never go through the company to buy my products because I don&#x27;t like the idea of them automatically withdarwing money out of my account.  So I come here and buy what I need as I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the refining mask...I love, love, love the refining mask.  Recently, I discovered that you can use it as Step#3 lotion and it&#x27;s more effective for acutual pimples. So I will use step#3 on my whole face and the refining mask as a spot treatment for pimples or trouble areas.  I put it on before I go to bed and usually with in the next day or two the pimple is completely dried up!!!  And that goes for the deep cystic pimples too!!!  And the great thing is this stuff is pretty cheap too!!!</li>
            <li> Love this refining mask! The blemish seems to disappear over night after applying this!</li>
            <li> For 1 month, I combined the High Frequency apparatus with 3 steps Proactive along with Proactive refining masks. Results show pores minimized and acne cured.</li>
            <li> Love this product iv been useing proactiv for few years now. your site is very afforable an reliable i highly recormend</li>
            <li> I use this about once or twice a week and I love it. I love all Proactive products. It is the only skin care that works for me.</li>
            <li> Meh. I felt as though this was a knock-off as it was not the normal consistency.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! No, it doesn&#x27;t work over night, but after about two nights of wearing it as a spot treatment, it works awesomely! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask for 10 years, tried other masks and still come back to this. The sulfur helps boost the healing of my skin from acne along with the benzoyl peroxide treatment that I use.</li>
            <li> Dries the skin to the point you get more acne. It does nothing for your skin but make it dry and ugly. I threw away mine.</li>
            <li> It works every time on problematic skin issues acne clears right up in a day or two â™¡ I highly recommend this during that time of the month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and it worked great!  So am happy to find more at a good price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for pimples that sprout up overnight. My friend and I are both addicted to it. I actually bought his two-pack as a gift for her as she uses it as a nightly  mask. It&#x27;s gentle enough on the skin but really does get rid of pimples fast! Much cheaper than buying it from Proactiv directly too!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It cleared my skin as a teenager and it continues to do the trick now at 23. I just bought some for the first time in years after trying a slew of other products and after just two applications my face is clearer than it has been in years. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for my teen son for years. I also use it myself when and it works great.  Its very strong so dont get it near your eyes. It really is great for breakouts and keeping them away.  I have switched to natures cure and its wonderful.  The price of natures cure is more reasonable and it works better. I love them both</li>
            <li> Great Small Size...It Gets The Job Done Except It Leaves Ur Face Sticky Nd Dry...I Suggest ANYONE 2 Buy This, I Wouldn&#x27;t Lie Like These Other Customers :)</li>
            <li> I have always had troubled skin and tried the Proactiv 3-step system more than once with failed results. I bought the mask as a spot treatment to wear at night because I hadn&#x27;t tried a sulfur medication yet. It works miracles! If you have a small zit it is significantly reduced or nearly gone by the morning when you use this. Plus, this seller offers prices WAY under market value!</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels after I was this refining mask off. Feels better if you leave on over night.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used for a fast and easy method of getting rid of a pimple or black head.</li>
