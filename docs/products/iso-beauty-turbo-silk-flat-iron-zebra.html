            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My old ISO (that I loved more than my CHI) broke after I dropped it one too many times.</li>
            <li>It heated up very quickly &amp; straightened my NATURAL CURLY hair very nicely.</li>
            <li>Super durable and cute too.</li>
            <li>now I can see why its being sold so cheap on here,&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>and it looks, feels and works as if its never been used before and plus it very cheap and pretty.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a similar one that I loved, but broke after I dropped it.  </li>
            <li>I heard of the company ISO but saw their products were super expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and its good for me because I have LONG hair.</li>
            <li>This product as I said , I can&#x27;t live without, I just revived it and after 2 days of use I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Heats up very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Plates easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li>Because I do love how soft and silky my hair</li>
            <li>this flat iron is really amazing</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;Looking to purchase a good quality flat iron for a decent price.</li>
            <li>,hair does look shiner,takes care of the freeze too but one thing i don&#x27;t like about it,  i burned my self with it, the straighter is really hot so,</li>
            <li>the straighter is really hot and the hair after it is too.</li>
            <li>Straight silky shiny hair!</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and shiny and the product heats up quickly and for us girls that like it hot it gets hot!</li>
            <li>I love the look of this flat iron.</li>
            <li>and you can do so much with it.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Heats fast.</li>
            <li>Zebra themed have whole ISO set now.</li>
            <li>Daughter wants giraffe print ones now.</li>
            <li>(it heats up quick, easy to use, and I can do my hair in less than 20 min.</li>
            <li>It is very well made and glides through with out a fuse..  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My only concern with it is there isn&#x27;t a way to change the temperature, so if you are a person with really fine hair, or have damaged hair for some reason, this flat iron will most likely fry your ends.</li>
            <li>This does not have a temperature dial but it heats up almost as hot as my old one that&#x27;s dial went up to 425.</li>
            <li>it left my hair smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Not worth having not even as a cheap one.</li>
            <li>This product looks cheap and am not sure if it damaging the hair or not.</li>
            <li>I got the professional tourmaline ionic straightener, turbo silk flat iron - zebra.</li>
            <li>: Nothing like a (ummm) bottom/ snap to keep it closed (stays open the whole time)&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>Does not seem to get as hot as my previous iso beauty zebra flat iron.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this straightener. I&#x27;ve had it going on a year now or more and its held up and you can do so much with it. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bummed that I am not able to change the temp settings. Does not seem to get as hot as my previous iso beauty zebra flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair iron!</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 ISO flat Irons in the past 3 years,&lt;br /&gt;which I purchased at the mall for $100, so when I saw it on here&lt;br /&gt;I jumped at the chance to get it. Because I do love how soft and silky my hair&lt;br /&gt;really gets when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;But now I can see why its being sold so cheap on here,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this one I received is a knock-off or it just&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t work well, but it&#x27;s NOWHERE close as the ones I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even weight anything and doesn&#x27;t heat up as well.&lt;br /&gt;I am SO returning it. Not worth having not even as a cheap one.</li>
            <li> I got the professional tourmaline ionic straightener, turbo silk flat iron - zebra. The thing is okay, and it does it&#x27;s work,hair does look shiner,takes care of the freeze too but one thing i don&#x27;t like about it,  i burned my self with it, the straighter is really hot so, -be careful with it! i heard a lot about it and some said that you can&#x27;t burn your self even when it&#x27;s close to the scalp, face, but it&#x27;s not true! the straighter is really hot and the hair after it is too.</li>
            <li> Came in today. They did not say that you need a transformer in the netherlands.. so i cant use the styling tool :(</li>
            <li> I love the look of this flat iron. It works really well and my hair stays strait all day long. My only concern with it is there isn&#x27;t a way to change the temperature, so if you are a person with really fine hair, or have damaged hair for some reason, this flat iron will most likely fry your ends. Other than that, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a used product and the iron seemed used and battered. I own Iso Beauty products but this one was now only smaller than the regular size but was really bad on my hair. The coil short-circuited after one month of use and I had to send it back to the seller.</li>
            <li> This iron works great on ethnic hair! I&#x27;m sure it works great on any hair! Straight silky shiny hair! Best iron I&#x27;ve had so far!</li>
            <li> My old ISO (that I loved more than my CHI) broke after I dropped it one too many times. This does not have a temperature dial but it heats up almost as hot as my old one that&#x27;s dial went up to 425. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Works great on curly hair.</li>
            <li> The second I&#x27;ve purchased over several yrs time. Super durable and cute too. My only dislike is that I was lead 59 believe it had different heat settings and it does NOT. BUT luckily it works great for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I really love the proliss brand.. Friends love and we had it over a year and no complaints.. Ladies proliss is awesome</li>
            <li> This product looks cheap and am not sure if it damaging the hair or not. It allows you to create curls with its floating plates. Heats fast. Overall like.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a similar one that I loved, but broke after I dropped it.  This one worked just as well for 2 weeks, then one of the plates stopped heating up. I won&#x27;t buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;Looking to purchase a good quality flat iron for a decent price. I have short hair so theres no alot to flat iron only the front. I heard of the company ISO but saw their products were super expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  Product arrive sooner than estimated time.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Plates easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Price.&lt;br /&gt;Zebra print looks better once  you receive the product  than the picture (picture is nice too).&lt;br /&gt;Long cord to reach far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Nothing like a (ummm) bottom/ snap to keep it closed (stays open the whole time)&lt;br /&gt;No AUTO on/off button.</li>
            <li> This product as I said , I can&#x27;t live without, I just revived it and after 2 days of use I love it. Leaves your hair soft and shiny and the product heats up quickly and for us girls that like it hot it gets hot!</li>
            <li> this flat iron is really amazing it left my hair smooth and soft I dont own one YET but my cousin has had one for over a year know and it looks, feels and works as if its never been used before and plus it very cheap and pretty. (it heats up quick, easy to use, and I can do my hair in less than 20 min. and its good for me because I have LONG hair.</li>
            <li> I just received my straightener yesterday &amp; I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. It heated up very quickly &amp; straightened my NATURAL CURLY hair very nicely. It made my hair silky smooth &amp; I cant wait to use it again. Great buy</li>
            <li> Perfect for a teenager</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter and found myself enjoying it as well.  It is very well made and glides through with out a fuse..  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love my straightener. Zebra themed have whole ISO set now. Love it. Daughter wants giraffe print ones now. They have them too.</li>
