            <li> It was nearly impossible to find this fragrance for sale anywhere about one year ago</li>

            <li> This was a gift for my wife, who loves it. Great price for a great gift.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing.  It was nearly impossible to find this fragrance for sale anywhere about one year ago so I had to switch to a different perfume for about one year.  I am so happy that it is available now.  It is a light fragrance that should last a good part of the day if sprayed on in the morning.  It is not an overpowering smell which is why my husband likes it.  I would recommend this item to others.</li>
            <li> Never smelled a fragrance so lovely!!!!  No wonder it&#x27;s sold out everywhere.!!&lt;br /&gt;I had a sample sent to me and I would chose this to be my number 1 choice.&lt;br /&gt;It is very hard to find and somewhat expensive.  But it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could find a small bottle of it.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, KC.  Washington.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love the fresh flowery scent.  Just right to brighten up a winter day without overpowering.</li>
            <li> Very light and soft. It is a great work perfume. I know that there were a lot of people waiting for its comeback.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and when opened, the neck of the bottle was dented and perfurme had leaked into the box.  My granddaughter loves the scent and there was quite a bit left in the bottle but could not return as it was out of stock but Amazon did give me credit for it.</li>
            <li> My wife is pleased she likes it thx</li>
            <li> was looking for light scent I could wear to work. (I am in medical field) fragrance is light- slightly floral and clean. perfect for daytime.</li>

            <li> Smells absolutely wonderful.... For about ten minutes. Never had a perfume scent disappear so quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance SOOO much.  Why can&#x27;t I get it anymore?  What a shame to find something you love and have it gone like a dream!!!! Shame on the distributors or makers of this beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> Great perfume not an over powering scent just fresh and gets noticed and I am always asked what I am wearing</li>
