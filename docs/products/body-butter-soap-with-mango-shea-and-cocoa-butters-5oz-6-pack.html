            <li>Love being able to order this soap now that I am no longer on Brooklyn where I could buy it locally.  </li>
            <li>I bought this soap because my wife was pregnant.</li>
            <li>She wanted to use Shea butter and Mango butter on her skin because she heard that both help alot in reducing stretch marks when you&#x27;re pregnant.</li>
            <li>To our lucky surprise this soap had both.</li>
            <li>The bar is a nice big size too.</li>

            <li>It also lathers up pretty quickly.</li>

            <li>Normally this soap is super expensive at most stores that carry it so imagine how thrilled I was when I saw I could get 6 bars for the normal price of 2.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY  sensitive skin and will break out almost instantly if a soap or lotion is too potent for my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I bought this soap because my wife was pregnant. She wanted to use Shea butter and Mango butter on her skin because she heard that both help alot in reducing stretch marks when you&#x27;re pregnant. Plus this soap is all natural.  To our lucky surprise this soap had both. After 9 months not one stretch mark. I can&#x27;t truly say if the soap helped, but hey it definitely didn&#x27;t hurt.  We shower daily, if not more, and one bar of soap lasts my wife and I a month.  I like the smell, I feel clean afterwards, the soap lasts long, my skin feels great, what else could you want from soap. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great but got so many mosquito bites...</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something natural the way it should be as opposed to heavily perfumed bar soaps with lord knows what chemicals in them and wow...loving these bars and their aroma. Never will go back to &amp;#34;deodorant soaps&amp;#34; and their funky additives again. Everything we need is right here provided by who??? Mother Nature...the way it should be! Leaves you feeling exceptionally clean, relaxed and skin is nice and smooth. No itching or dryness.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this soap. I like the fact I can see all the dirt removed from my skin, it lets me know I&#x27;m getting really clean. Plus I love how my skin feels after. Normally this soap is super expensive at most stores that carry it so imagine how thrilled I was when I saw I could get 6 bars for the normal price of 2.</li>
