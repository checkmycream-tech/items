            <li> When you cut yourself shaving, use this pencil with cold water and the bleeding stops right away! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice large size. Very affective on small nicks.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> A must have for all of us who occasionally nick our face when shaving.</li>
            <li> it burns when they use it~</li>
            <li> works great affective within 2 seconds of appliment</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful .  Just like the old days.</li>
            <li> Wish I had this since the 1st day I started shaving. Cuts from shaving are no longer a hassle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s styptic pencil. Does what it should.</li>
            <li> This Pencil is not flexable so if you drop it you break it. However, save any pieces you&#x27;ve broken because this pencil is multi purpose. Not only have the blood stains from my husbands towels disappeared after shaving, I&#x27;ve been using the pieces I broke off to treat my pimples with great success.  I only like it because I broke it. I love it because it works.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, stops bleeding right now!!</li>
            <li> Taking blood thinner and this is a great Stypic.  Wish it was smaller in size, maybe crayon sized.</li>
            <li> Oh man! With this I&#x27;ve been able to really seal up some nasty razor cuts. I mean I&#x27;ve really mutilated myself and been fine in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t compare the quality of this brand to other styptic pencil brands the oz/price ratio seems better than most.</li>
