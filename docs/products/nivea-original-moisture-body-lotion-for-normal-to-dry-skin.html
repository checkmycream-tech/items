            <li>The original scent is amazing</li>
            <li>These stuff is great, you apply and it works the first time, cheap stuff you have to put on over and over again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with Nivea &amp; I love the Original scent.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Finally, a great product with a nice simple scent in a plain bottle &amp; a great price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s reasonably priced available in the US now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is listed as PARABEN FREE, which is why I bought three bottles of this.</li>
            <li>Have been using this from last 3 year , great as always</li>
            <li>A lovely and easily absorbed body cream.</li>
            <li>I personally enjoy and blends well with my perfume.</li>
            <li>At times the original variety has not been available in retail stores.  </li>
            <li>and I vary from touch of harmony or original creme moisture body wash.</li>
            <li>Nivea has been and always will be my fave lotion it has a unique perfume and leaves my skin like silk</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was in Europe many moons ago.</li>
            <li>Not as it was originally made.</li>
            <li>This is a decent moisturizer, but the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>Nivea Original Moisture Body Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin - Great product!!</li>
            <li>There are more advanced Lotions out there now but nivea and jergens classic  remain on the market because they are still favorites</li>
            <li>The original moisture lotion absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant and subtle aroma.</li>
            <li>At the same time it is soaking into skin very easily.  </li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is fine, but it smells like a mix of old people and feet.</li>
            <li>The second one being my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this and can not wait for my next bottle.</li>
            <li>nice smelling, as expected!</li>
            <li>thick &amp; smooth, nice scent</li>
            <li>I will use it up though and then buy something more richer/thicker for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It smells a little clinical rather than nicely scented.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my skin very well.</li>
            <li>there are so many other moisturizers out there</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a bit better as Nivea facial products last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Love this brand of lotion, one if few I can use</li>
            <li>Get the Original Moisturizer, all others may feel too thick, too wet or too strong of a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is lower than any retailer in our area, so we will be a steady customer in the future.</li>
            <li>However, I still like some other brands a little better.  </li>
            <li>Really greasy and liquid like, it may not be for everyone because i usually use cream and this lotion makes my skin really oily.</li>
            <li>I come from the south,when I came to the north,my skin could barely bear the dryness.....</li>
            <li>The top of the lotion was broken and it was lotion everywhere in the box.  </li>
            <li>but I either feel them very light or difficult to spread on my hands while applying.</li>

            <li> have one in the car, at work and multiple bottles around the house since I have severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin and this truly helped with winter skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom as she has dry skins.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO get a lotion for dry skin,and this works so well!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lotion with a standard texture, if a littly greasy.  </li>
            <li> I dunno, expected this to blow my mind based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> as expected performance.</li>
            <li> No better than something I could have gotten from the local dollar store.</li>
            <li> Imagine my dissapointment when I got the lotion, and turned over other the bottle.</li>
            <li> Watered down.</li>
            <li> Cracked, dry heels were no more after using this at night.</li>
            <li> A little watery to me.</li>
            <li> Either way, wasted my money and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Nivea especially for people with sensitive skin, those who hate lotion residue (this has none) &amp; for those who hate all those annoying scents.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list on this product is wrong.</li>
            <li> Ill keep this around for those &amp;#34;not so dry&amp;#34;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The ingredient list on this product is wrong. It is listed as PARABEN FREE, which is why I bought three bottles of this. In fact, the last two ingredients on the bottles I received are Methylparaben and Ethylparaben, which are PARABENS. Update this listing to correctly reflect the ingredients on this product. Returned.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my skin very well. No better than something I could have gotten from the local dollar store.</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  Non greasy.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Have been using this from last 3 year , great as always</li>
            <li> I love it..  It is not causing any oily feeling.  At the same time it is soaking into skin very easily.  I am using it from 2 days and fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> A lovely and easily absorbed body cream. Pleasant and very light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Nivea body lotion is a quality product of longstanding.  At times the original variety has not been available in retail stores.  It was very easy to purcgase a supply of 6 via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife who is a longtime user.  The price is lower than any retailer in our area, so we will be a steady customer in the future.</li>
            <li> I dunno, expected this to blow my mind based on the reviews.  It&#x27;s lotion with a standard texture, if a littly greasy.  I should get back to work.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of lotion, one if few I can use</li>
            <li> Nice smell and I like it very much. Iam fan of Aveeno, but I thought I would give a try and it is good one.</li>
            <li> Finally, a great product with a nice simple scent in a plain bottle &amp; a great price! I&#x27;m in love with Nivea &amp; I love the Original scent. Amazon has this as a Add On item AND a Subscribe &amp; Save! I signed up &amp; bought some now! Score! I highly recommend Nivea especially for people with sensitive skin, those who hate lotion residue (this has none) &amp; for those who hate all those annoying scents. This has a nice pleasant scent. Nothing overwhelming. Keep it simple. If it&#x27;s not broke don&#x27;t fix it &amp; Nivea is perfect just the way it is</li>
            <li> Winter dries your skin in upstate NY and my Hubby is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;I used to make him use mine and he would complain that he went to work smelling like a girl and felt greasy.&lt;br /&gt; He likes this as it does not leave a greasy film and it does not smell girly.&lt;br /&gt;Good price from Amazon</li>
            <li> Lotion has a funky (bad) smell to it. I&#x27;ve used Nivea for years and never had it smell bad before.</li>
            <li> So I have a Nivea bathing ritual. I use the touch of renewal scrub and I vary from touch of harmony or original creme moisture body wash. The second one being my favorite. The original scent is amazing I personally enjoy and blends well with my perfume. The original moisture lotion absorbs quickly and is not greasy. The greasy nivea lotion is the enriched one I back away from that one.  My skin is always glowing and looking healthy. No complaints at all. There are more advanced Lotions out there now but nivea and jergens classic  remain on the market because they are still favorites</li>
            <li> Lotion provided moisture my body needed. I suffer from extremely dry skin and this truly helped with winter skin. Will definitely use again</li>
            <li> Nivea has been and always will be my fave lotion it has a unique perfume and leaves my skin like silk</li>
            <li> Really greasy and liquid like, it may not be for everyone because i usually use cream and this lotion makes my skin really oily. Not for me</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom as she has dry skins. My mom loves it as the smell is neutral. very good product</li>
            <li> These stuff is great, you apply and it works the first time, cheap stuff you have to put on over and over again but Nivea never gives me a problem</li>
            <li> well it serves the purpose and best part i liked about it is its smell. Very good smell .. there are so many other moisturizers out there but this one so far was best smelling!</li>
            <li> Nivea Original Moisture Body Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin - Great product!! Got in time, would recommend for sure!!</li>
            <li> I come from the south,when I came to the north,my skin could barely bear the dryness.....I HAVE TO get a lotion for dry skin,and this works so well! And it smells good!</li>
            <li> The top of the lotion was broken and it was lotion everywhere in the box.  I didn&#x27;t bother to complain because I did not want to be bothered with sending it back but I was seriously upset!!!</li>
            <li> Quality product that has been around for years. It provides great moisture that lasts all day and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mostly on my heels of my feet, and it has been doing wonders. Cracked, dry heels were no more after using this at night.</li>
            <li> Love the hydration and smell. The first time I used it was in Europe many moons ago. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s reasonably priced available in the US now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one in the car, at work and multiple bottles around the house since I have severely dry skin. Holds up great in Florida summer heat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over ten years now and I can&#x27;t seem to find anything to replace nor would I want to.  Get the Original Moisturizer, all others may feel too thick, too wet or too strong of a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad Amazon is offering this lotion as a subscription making it even a better deal!</li>
            <li> i love this product. as expected performance. cant beat this price. 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell this leaves behind. Mosturizes but also leaves some residue that drives me nuts through out the day.</li>
            <li> Saved some money when bought from Amazon. Using it for years. Great product by Nivea.</li>
            <li> Excellent Moisturizer. Very pleasant and subtle aroma.</li>
            <li> this stuff is okay buy kinda watery. the smell can sometimes be overpowering if you want to put it all over after bathing.  It smells a little clinical rather than nicely scented. I will use it up though and then buy something more richer/thicker for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> thick &amp; smooth, nice scent</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Watered down. Not as it was originally made.</li>
            <li> Works great as a moisturizer, and I see the difference in my skin the day after using it. I sleep with it and it washes off in the morning. However, I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face during the day as it feels like I&#x27;m wearing a film.</li>
            <li> I trust the Nivea brand.  I already know the quality of the brand.  I was able to get this on subscribe and save for a great deal.  My only gripe about this particular lotion is that it&#x27;s not the thick, rich quality of the Nivea lotion i usually get from my local Target or Walmart.  Still great lotion however.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this product is good.  However, I still like some other brands a little better.  The lotion doesn&#x27;t last very long at all in winter.  I thought it would be a bit better as Nivea facial products last much longer.  Ill keep this around for those &amp;#34;not so dry&amp;#34; skin days lol</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it very regularly. It keep my body moisturized for quite a bit of time. I use others but I either feel them very light or difficult to spread on my hands while applying. Nivea has the correct consistency to apply.</li>
            <li> nice smelling, as expected!</li>
            <li> A little watery to me. Better for warmer months. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for winter.</li>
            <li> I love this and can not wait for my next bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a decent moisturizer, but the smell is very strong. My husband always comments as soon as I put it on. Good for winter hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the list of ingredients did NOT include any parabens.  Imagine my dissapointment when I got the lotion, and turned over other the bottle. There in the ingredient list on the bottle is parabens.  So, either the company changed the formula, or the ingredient list here is out of date. Either way, wasted my money and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Used this for forty-five years.  Good for people with allergies and anyone.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is fine, but it smells like a mix of old people and feet.</li>
            <li> The Nivea lotion has Parabens.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a tradition in our family.  Recommended.</li>
