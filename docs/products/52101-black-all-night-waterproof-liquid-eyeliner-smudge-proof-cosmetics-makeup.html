            <li>and I love it thaks</li>
            <li>I love the wand, I love the ink</li>
            <li>I love them both.  </li>
            <li>I love it, but also it flakes off....</li>
            <li>It is cute, durable, and fits my phone perfectly .i will be ordering more, on different colors</li>
            <li>Shell out a bit more and get one from a trusted beauty brand.</li>
            <li>Cutest bottle, but the important part is using it&amp;#62; Its amazing.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed that when removing my eye makeup, it doesn&#x27;t smear and wipe all over my face and take more cotton pads to take off all of it, like when I use gel or pencil liner.</li>
            <li>I am glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner, not only is the bottle cute, but the felt tips work GREAT!</li>
            <li>Love this I had to order another</li>
            <li>I LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It drys fast and makes great lines.</li>
            <li>The makeup works better than I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>but i love it</li>
            <li>but its still cute haven&#x27;t tried yet.</li>
            <li>I love the felt tip.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute.</li>
            <li>I would like to say the all night eyeliner is just like it says all night I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I will be getting more.</li>
            <li>it was okay .</li>
            <li>i wish it was better product .</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>No biggie, I still love it.</li>
            <li>I like the felt tip much better</li>
            <li>I wish they had more colors I would buy them.</li>
            <li>Ive never tried a better eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The price is right and looks good.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, it comes in such a cute container!!! :)</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t come off so easy and that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t smear or wear off throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used liquid eyeliner until this morning... took about a week to arrive, but was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The applicator is felt, which is really easy to use for winged or cateye looks.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes if it manages to get in there, and it survived a shower without coming off (until the face scrub of course)</li>
            <li>As a beginner it was extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>but this product can easily smudge.</li>
            <li>It is easy to control and marks</li>
            <li>But I am on a mission now to fine a true waterproof liquid fine point eyeliner for the upcoming summer!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t as good  as the product I purchase normally.</li>
            <li>This eye liner is great for such an affordable price!!</li>
            <li>Went on smoothly with the freedom to detail my eyes just the way I wanted to.</li>
            <li>This product was cute and fun.</li>
            <li>Cheap packaging and cheap product.</li>
            <li>I Loved this product and I will be buying a lot more of it hopefully at the same price and in bulk if they have that!</li>
            <li>The liner dries very quickly and it is true to color.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast though!!!</li>
            <li>This really is waterproof and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Great long handle works well for me.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li>thanks..:)</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>last for a good while and will not smear, dries very fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second bottle, I ordered another one like 7 months ago and its so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute and decently sized.</li>
            <li>I have used this product a few times and really think it is a great product!</li>
            <li>but it actually was not by the second hour of wear it would be clumped in the corners of my eyes, but not this eye liner it is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>But it dries up quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not some amazing liner made for celebrities, but it&#x27;s decent and pretty much worth the price.</li>
            <li>I work out alot, so it&#x27;s not completely waterproof or smudgeproof, but it does give it a good try.</li>
            <li>I will admit the tip is very hard, but the liner comes on perfectly and stays on!!!</li>
            <li>Well worth the $$</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is soooo much worth a dollar.</li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive to most eyeliners.</li>
            <li>the one thing i really loved about it, is when i apply it it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes which most of them do, and i go out with blood shot eyes which is not very attractive,</li>
            <li>its great with the stiff brush but after a while it softens up.  </li>
            <li>However it does not seem to be water proof, comes right off with a Q-tip and water..</li>
            <li>but it was still there in the morning with the exception of a few chips but was not smudged : ) I will for sure be purchasing more of this product in the future!</li>
            <li>I bought this at the same time I bought the cute Panda eyeliner...</li>
            <li>Ok, I ordered a japanese doll shaped eyeliner &amp; received this one instead.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY reccommeded!!</li>
            <li>It was very shiny and it looked cheap, it did not look smooth and almost seemed to bubble dry a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this may not be eye-healthy in the long term.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to buy more next week.  </li>
            <li>Not really worth to be honest</li>
            <li>, I cannot stand that it wipes off easily if you yawn or obviously cry.</li>
            <li>Liner glides on easily and remains in place for the entire day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re looking to try liquid liner, but it isn&#x27;t long lasting and the shape of the applicator tip isn&#x27;t as precise as I&#x27;d like it to be.</li>
            <li>This is a good item it went on smooth and lasted without cracking dry results ten hours later, It wasn&#x27;t there when I woke up</li>
            <li>Held up all day and went on very simply and accurately without getting in my eyes.</li>
            <li>so i just go over a balck pencil if i feel its too much.</li>
            <li>Very misleading because one of the pictures for this product did show the teddy bear bottle.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d really like to try it.</li>
            <li>really well&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The product shipped fast and was packaged</li>
            <li>It came fast</li>
            <li>Do not like... very hard to apply ...smears easily, could be good for younger steady hands but not mine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even apply nicely to your eyes, you&#x27;d have to practically stab your eye out just to put a small amount of product on</li>
            <li>Think I might switch it out again, but, overall, not a bad idea....</li>
            <li>The ink was dry when I got it (but it was cheap, who&#x27;s complaining?)</li>
            <li>The bottle is cute but the product doesn&#x27;t last all day and definitely isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
            <li>I love how I don&#x27;t mess up.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for people wanting those cat eyes liner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again if the shipping wasn&#x27;t so high though</li>
            <li>I got the little teal colored bear, it&#x27;s cute packaging.</li>
            <li>This is personally my favorite liquid eyeliner I have used, and for once, I have found one that truly is waterproof and lasts relatively all day long.</li>
            <li>This one looks fresh the entire time.</li>
            <li>My only problem is it looks like the liquid tar of a freshly paved road when it dries.</li>
            <li>I only need one coat and ready to go!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different liquid eyeliners in the past, this is the first liner that has not stung when I painted it on eye lids.</li>
            <li>these are cute, they are tiny but really cute, unfortunately they burned my eyes</li>
            <li>but it said that it is smudge free and when I apply it, then go back to my original face look (u kno what i mean</li>
            <li>Great liner really thick and long lasting!</li>
            <li>But I probably will in the future, and no not just because of the cute little bear container.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dark a huge difference from pencil eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect this product to work so well, considering the low price.</li>
            <li>This item works REALLY well, and it got to me in only 3 days.</li>
            <li>It works well, especially with my under eye eyeliner tray---stays put all day, without any sealant-Thankyou so much, jennifer Lil K</li>
            <li>I was able to wear this eyeliner all day for at least eight hours with no issues or burning, itching, puffiness, or redness.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the tips seem to get ruined awfully fast.</li>
            <li>The brush is to stiff and does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Seller shipped this item quickly and it arrived before expected!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously regretting not buying more. . .</li>
            <li>Its a bold black and holds up well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>But sometimes if your not careful it can be a bit of a mess to clean up..</li>
            <li>The felt tip is really helpful and the eyeliner itself stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and does not leave any chunks behind.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is definitely waterproof-My eyes water constantly from allergies, and only towards the very end of the day does this start to flake off.</li>
            <li>affordable&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several different liquid eyeliners and this one is by far my fave!</li>
            <li>weak color, does not last for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Not dark enough.</li>
            <li>It has the hard application, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>Packaging unappealing but product seems pretty adequate, long lasting and stays in place.  </li>
            <li>The eyeliner itself is really black, dries fast &amp; is smudge proof.</li>
            <li>the tip is so fine, thin, and sturdy.</li>

            <li> I put it on very easily and it stayed on.</li>
            <li> Its very accurate when you use it and very easy to use too.</li>
            <li> It has been nice to have and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I love the felt tip and the bottle that it is enclosed in</li>
            <li> and I love it thaks</li>
            <li> I love the wand, I love the ink</li>
            <li> I love them both.  </li>
            <li> I love it, but also it flakes off....</li>
            <li> It is cute, durable, and fits my phone perfectly .i will be ordering more, on different colors</li>
            <li> Shell out a bit more and get one from a trusted beauty brand.</li>
            <li> Cutest bottle, but the important part is using it&amp;#62; Its amazing.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that when removing my eye makeup, it doesn&#x27;t smear and wipe all over my face and take more cotton pads to take off all of it, like when I use gel or pencil liner.</li>
            <li> I am glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner, not only is the bottle cute, but the felt tips work GREAT!</li>
            <li> Love this I had to order another</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It drys fast and makes great lines.</li>
            <li> The makeup works better than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> but i love it</li>
            <li> but its still cute haven&#x27;t tried yet.</li>
            <li> I love the felt tip.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cute.</li>
            <li> I would like to say the all night eyeliner is just like it says all night I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I will be getting more.</li>
            <li> it was okay .</li>
            <li> i wish it was better product .</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> No biggie, I still love it.</li>
            <li> I like the felt tip much better</li>
            <li> I wish they had more colors I would buy them.</li>
            <li> Ive never tried a better eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The price is right and looks good.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, it comes in such a cute container!!! :)</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t come off so easy and that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to remove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t smear or wear off throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used liquid eyeliner until this morning... took about a week to arrive, but was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The applicator is felt, which is really easy to use for winged or cateye looks.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes if it manages to get in there, and it survived a shower without coming off (until the face scrub of course)</li>
            <li> As a beginner it was extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> but this product can easily smudge.</li>
            <li> It is easy to control and marks</li>
            <li> But I am on a mission now to fine a true waterproof liquid fine point eyeliner for the upcoming summer!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t as good  as the product I purchase normally.</li>
            <li> This eye liner is great for such an affordable price!!</li>
            <li> Went on smoothly with the freedom to detail my eyes just the way I wanted to.</li>
            <li> This product was cute and fun.</li>
            <li> Cheap packaging and cheap product.</li>
            <li> I Loved this product and I will be buying a lot more of it hopefully at the same price and in bulk if they have that!</li>
            <li> The liner dries very quickly and it is true to color.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast though!!!</li>
            <li> This really is waterproof and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Great long handle works well for me.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li> thanks..:)</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> last for a good while and will not smear, dries very fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second bottle, I ordered another one like 7 months ago and its so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cute and decently sized.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times and really think it is a great product!</li>
            <li> but it actually was not by the second hour of wear it would be clumped in the corners of my eyes, but not this eye liner it is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> But it dries up quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not some amazing liner made for celebrities, but it&#x27;s decent and pretty much worth the price.</li>
            <li> I work out alot, so it&#x27;s not completely waterproof or smudgeproof, but it does give it a good try.</li>
            <li> I will admit the tip is very hard, but the liner comes on perfectly and stays on!!!</li>
            <li> Well worth the $$</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is soooo much worth a dollar.</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive to most eyeliners.</li>
            <li> the one thing i really loved about it, is when i apply it it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes which most of them do, and i go out with blood shot eyes which is not very attractive,</li>
            <li> its great with the stiff brush but after a while it softens up.  </li>
            <li> However it does not seem to be water proof, comes right off with a Q-tip and water..</li>
            <li> but it was still there in the morning with the exception of a few chips but was not smudged : ) I will for sure be purchasing more of this product in the future!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the same time I bought the cute Panda eyeliner...</li>
            <li> Ok, I ordered a japanese doll shaped eyeliner &amp; received this one instead.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY reccommeded!!</li>
            <li> It was very shiny and it looked cheap, it did not look smooth and almost seemed to bubble dry a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this may not be eye-healthy in the long term.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to buy more next week.  </li>
            <li> Not really worth to be honest</li>
            <li> , I cannot stand that it wipes off easily if you yawn or obviously cry.</li>
            <li> Liner glides on easily and remains in place for the entire day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re looking to try liquid liner, but it isn&#x27;t long lasting and the shape of the applicator tip isn&#x27;t as precise as I&#x27;d like it to be.</li>
            <li> This is a good item it went on smooth and lasted without cracking dry results ten hours later, It wasn&#x27;t there when I woke up</li>
            <li> Held up all day and went on very simply and accurately without getting in my eyes.</li>
            <li> so i just go over a balck pencil if i feel its too much.</li>
            <li> Very misleading because one of the pictures for this product did show the teddy bear bottle.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d really like to try it.</li>
            <li> really well&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The product shipped fast and was packaged</li>
            <li> It came fast</li>
            <li> Do not like... very hard to apply ...smears easily, could be good for younger steady hands but not mine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even apply nicely to your eyes, you&#x27;d have to practically stab your eye out just to put a small amount of product on</li>
            <li> Think I might switch it out again, but, overall, not a bad idea....</li>
            <li> The ink was dry when I got it (but it was cheap, who&#x27;s complaining?)</li>
            <li> The bottle is cute but the product doesn&#x27;t last all day and definitely isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
            <li> I love how I don&#x27;t mess up.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for people wanting those cat eyes liner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again if the shipping wasn&#x27;t so high though</li>
            <li> I got the little teal colored bear, it&#x27;s cute packaging.</li>
            <li> This is personally my favorite liquid eyeliner I have used, and for once, I have found one that truly is waterproof and lasts relatively all day long.</li>
            <li> This one looks fresh the entire time.</li>
            <li> My only problem is it looks like the liquid tar of a freshly paved road when it dries.</li>
            <li> I only need one coat and ready to go!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different liquid eyeliners in the past, this is the first liner that has not stung when I painted it on eye lids.</li>
            <li> these are cute, they are tiny but really cute, unfortunately they burned my eyes</li>
            <li> but it said that it is smudge free and when I apply it, then go back to my original face look (u kno what i mean</li>
            <li> Great liner really thick and long lasting!</li>
            <li> But I probably will in the future, and no not just because of the cute little bear container.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark a huge difference from pencil eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this product to work so well, considering the low price.</li>
            <li> This item works REALLY well, and it got to me in only 3 days.</li>
            <li> It works well, especially with my under eye eyeliner tray---stays put all day, without any sealant-Thankyou so much, jennifer Lil K</li>
            <li> I was able to wear this eyeliner all day for at least eight hours with no issues or burning, itching, puffiness, or redness.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the tips seem to get ruined awfully fast.</li>
            <li> The brush is to stiff and does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped this item quickly and it arrived before expected!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously regretting not buying more. . .</li>
            <li> Its a bold black and holds up well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> But sometimes if your not careful it can be a bit of a mess to clean up..</li>
            <li> The felt tip is really helpful and the eyeliner itself stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and does not leave any chunks behind.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is definitely waterproof-My eyes water constantly from allergies, and only towards the very end of the day does this start to flake off.</li>
            <li> affordable&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several different liquid eyeliners and this one is by far my fave!</li>
            <li> weak color, does not last for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Not dark enough.</li>
            <li> It has the hard application, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> Packaging unappealing but product seems pretty adequate, long lasting and stays in place.  </li>
            <li> The eyeliner itself is really black, dries fast &amp; is smudge proof.</li>
            <li> the tip is so fine, thin, and sturdy.</li>
            <li> It goes on well and has a shiny dark grey (not jet black like the picture) appearance when dry, which is fine.</li>
            <li> I mean I guess it was worth the price</li>
            <li> THin or Thick lines, go on smoothly, lasts all day, great for everyday or dramatic lines.</li>
            <li> I only give it 4 stars as I do not feel its lasts as long as it could.</li>
            <li> but since it uses marker ink, anyways, I replenished it by putting the inside of an old black marker inside....</li>
            <li> A DEEP BLACK IS IS NOT DRY GOING ON LIKE SOME WATERPROOF EYELINERS BUT I&#x27;LL</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the opposite is true.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a very long time, I had this eyeliner on almost all day and kept it on through the night (oops)</li>
            <li> The liner doesn&#x27;t smear, Once it&#x27;s dry...</li>
            <li> Plus I notice after two weeks its starts to dry up.  </li>
            <li> Also it stays for a long time!!</li>
            <li> Like dollar store eyeliner very dry</li>
            <li> This product is long lasting, but flakes after being on over night, yet I lazy sometimes, but would not have discovered it had I not slept in it.  </li>
            <li> They come in three colors I guess from the picture, and I received the pink one.</li>
            <li> I tested it on my hand &amp; it last for a few hrs, even after washing my hands, so</li>
            <li> So be careful using this..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark black, not grey, and stays that way.</li>
            <li> Brush is too thin and did not last all day as the ad had indicated, I needed long last eyeliner..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to get it straight on the upper lash line</li>
            <li> It is extremely waterproof.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I threw it away when I saw it was made in a foreign country.</li>
            <li> ) it smeared onto the top of my eyelid which made it look stupid.</li>
            <li> it was really crusty and difficult to apply and it just rubs off.</li>
            <li> and this is not worth a dime.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m probably just gonna throw it out, not worth the dollar or the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I was just looking at random Asian cosmetic products for the sheer cuteness of them</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, because it was in a little teddy bear bottle, and because it was very inexpensive-Looked like a kid&#x27;s play kit.</li>
            <li> When i bought it i thought that since it was not as expensive as the &amp;#34; high quality&amp;#34; eyeliner you  might  receive from Sephora, that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Feels dry and is hard to apply without it</li>
            <li> A little thrown off by the &amp;#34;bear&amp;#34; bottle</li>
            <li> Came to me all dried out.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels dried up don&#x27;t write I&#x27;m getting a refund</li>
            <li> Because it burned my eyelids, idk if it&#x27;s just me, but when I put it on it burns for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> The product is not the one pictured, I got a dried up pen like product.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it was dried out when i received it</li>
            <li> I USE IT EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> i HAVE USED THIS LIQUID EYELINER EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> but it came all dried up, and like nothing comes out.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is also extremely small.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do</li>
            <li> All my past eyeliners always came on or smudge or looked like it needed to be retouched.</li>
            <li> No more smudges or raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Dramatic Black, dark eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> The tip was so hard I could not get it on my eye was afraid I would stab myself do not waste your money</li>
            <li> You have to press it hard to get it on.</li>
            <li> This product sucks dick,</li>
            <li> and I just have to peel it off slowly or use my makeup</li>
            <li> I seriously would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is not too thin, and I have vision problems even with magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> It is utter crap.</li>
            <li> false claim.</li>
            <li> NOTHING IS WRONG WITH IT.</li>
            <li> I would hav to stay in this crazy face position until it dryed so it wouldnt smudge.</li>
            <li> Was completely dried out and horrible quality.</li>
            <li> Too bad, i was looking forward in using it.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt reccomend this. :(</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not dark enough. Feels dry and is hard to apply without it feeling like your scraping off a layer of skin. Returning.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very good at applying it.</li>
            <li> This product is long lasting, but flakes after being on over night, yet I lazy sometimes, but would not have discovered it had I not slept in it.  It has been nice to have and easy to use.  It has the hard application, but not bad.  The price is right and looks good.</li>
            <li> The concept is great! Who wouldn&#x27;t want a eyeliner that lasts. Unfortunately the opposite is true. It didn&#x27;t last even to the end of my 8 hour work day.</li>
            <li> I love the felt tip and the bottle that it is enclosed in and it makes perfect lines and I love it thaks</li>
            <li> I love the wand, I love the ink, I cannot stand that it wipes off easily if you yawn or obviously cry.</li>
            <li> the tip is so fine, thin, and sturdy. I love this!! ive been buying it for a while and its the best.  It is extremely waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;The color is shiny so i just go over a balck pencil if i feel its too much.</li>
            <li> Love these! They work beautifully even though they look cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the same time I bought the cute Panda eyeliner...I love them both.  Easy to apply and lasts all day!!  Seller shipped this item quickly and it arrived before expected!!  Well worth the $$</li>
            <li> It bothers me that this doesn&#x27;t come sealed at all. You have no way of knowing if it has been used or not. It is also extremely small. It is not easy to use. I am very disappointed but obviously you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what was shown in the picture. Came to me all dried out. as soon as I opened it I tossed it into the trash can</li>
            <li> Looks and feels dried up don&#x27;t write I&#x27;m getting a refund</li>
            <li> Like dollar store eyeliner very dry</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying the same eyeliner I had purchased twice before, which was in a teddy bear bottle, but this is totally different and doesn&#x27;t work as well. Very misleading because one of the pictures for this product did show the teddy bear bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! It&#x27;s my second bottle, I ordered another one like 7 months ago and its so nice and smooth. It lasts all day and it doesn&#x27;t smear, with water it doesn&#x27;t come off so easy and that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li> I never received this but I paid for it.  Not sure what to do but I&#x27;d really like to try it.</li>
            <li> I want to actually give it 4 1/2 stars, why? Because it burned my eyelids, idk if it&#x27;s just me, but when I put it on it burns for a few minutes. I love it, but also it flakes off....i dont like that, but it works good :)</li>
            <li> You have to press it hard to get it on.</li>
            <li> The ink was dry when I got it (but it was cheap, who&#x27;s complaining?) but since it uses marker ink, anyways, I replenished it by putting the inside of an old black marker inside.... maybe I should use a newer one?  Think I might switch it out again, but, overall, not a bad idea....</li>
            <li> This is personally my favorite liquid eyeliner I have used, and for once, I have found one that truly is waterproof and lasts relatively all day long.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! Perfect line every time, and the best thing of all is that even though it is waterproof it comes off so easy with water and a rag without having to scub your eyelashes out, but you still need soap because it does stain a bit,but not unless you do use soap. So yeah, if you want a liquid line this stuff is Sooooo awesome.</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted. It is cute, durable, and fits my phone perfectly .i will be ordering more, on different colors</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great!! The tip is perfect. This one actually stays on for the time you need it to. All my past eyeliners always came on or smudge or looked like it needed to be retouched. This one looks fresh the entire time. It is also easy to remove. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re looking to try liquid liner, but it isn&#x27;t long lasting and the shape of the applicator tip isn&#x27;t as precise as I&#x27;d like it to be. Shell out a bit more and get one from a trusted beauty brand.</li>
            <li> Cutest bottle, but the important part is using it&amp;#62; Its amazing. Held up all day and went on very simply and accurately without getting in my eyes. Highly recommend for people wanting those cat eyes liner.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this product to work so well, considering the low price. I&#x27;m seriously regretting not buying more. . . But I probably will in the future, and no not just because of the cute little bear container. :)</li>
            <li> Brush is too thin and did not last all day as the ad had indicated, I needed long last eyeliner..</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is pretty good for the price. I was just looking at random Asian cosmetic products for the sheer cuteness of them but this works great. They come in three colors I guess from the picture, and I received the pink one. It&#x27;s really easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t smear or wear off throughout the day. It&#x27;s very dark black, not grey, and stays that way. Also, I noticed that when removing my eye makeup, it doesn&#x27;t smear and wipe all over my face and take more cotton pads to take off all of it, like when I use gel or pencil liner. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this may not be eye-healthy in the long term. It goes on well and has a shiny dark grey (not jet black like the picture) appearance when dry, which is fine. My only problem is it looks like the liquid tar of a freshly paved road when it dries. I</li>
            <li> I bought two of these.  I would not recommend the eyeliner.  The brush is to stiff and does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is very good for the price, but when applied, the color looks shiny, and tends to flake off</li>
            <li> I give this a 2 stars because when I applied it on my eye it was.. crusty? it was really crusty and difficult to apply and it just rubs off. I don&#x27;t suggest it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This eye liner is great for such an affordable price!! I wore it all day and it didnt smudge AT ALL!!!! It&#x27;s a little difficult to get it straight on the upper lash line but that might just be me that I&#x27;m not the best at putting on liquid eye liner! I love this and highly recommend it. I will definitely be repurchasing!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love the price of course and it has a good stay put attitude to it! I only give it 4 stars as I do not feel its lasts as long as it could.</li>
            <li> It was a gift! And the gift was spoilt because whe she oppened the package all liquid was on the bottle))) not in the bottle))) so the gift was spoilt!(((</li>
            <li> this is perfect, it has the perfect lining and is very thin.&lt;br /&gt;it last for a good while and will not smear, dries very fast!</li>
            <li> THIS IS O.K. FOR THE PRICE BUT IT IS NOT WATERPROOFNOR  SMUDGE P[ROOF BUT GOED ON REALLY GOOD AND A DEEP BLACK IS IS NOT DRY GOING ON LIKE SOME WATERPROOF EYELINERS BUT I&#x27;LL KEEP IT FOR THE PRAICE IS VERY GOOD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used liquid eyeliner until this morning... took about a week to arrive, but was easy to apply. It&#x27;s very dark a huge difference from pencil eyeliner. I am glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is definitely waterproof-My eyes water constantly from allergies, and only towards the very end of the day does this start to flake off. I was a little skeptical, because it was in a little teddy bear bottle, and because it was very inexpensive-Looked like a kid&#x27;s play kit. But it works, and I am telling everyone about it!!!</li>
            <li> Great color&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Applies really well&lt;br /&gt;Very affordable&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several different liquid eyeliners and this one is by far my fave!</li>
            <li> I like this product but it said that it is smudge free and when I apply it, then go back to my original face look (u kno what i mean) it smeared onto the top of my eyelid which made it look stupid. So I had to try and rub it off with my fingers which got it all over my hands. I would hav to stay in this crazy face position until it dryed so it wouldnt smudge. Plus it faded literally 1 minute after i applyed it. I would only recommend this product if u kno how to put it on properly.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner and the brush is awesome too!  It is not too thin, and I have vision problems even with magnifying mirror.  I only need one coat and ready to go!  I am getting ready to buy more next week.  Love this!</li>
            <li> I threw it away when I saw it was made in a foreign country.</li>
            <li> Ok, I ordered a japanese doll shaped eyeliner &amp; received this one instead. This seller is working on sending me what I ordered, so I thought I&#x27;d review the item that was actually sent. I got the little teal colored bear, it&#x27;s cute packaging. The applicator is felt, which is really easy to use for winged or cateye looks. The eyeliner itself is really black, dries fast &amp; is smudge proof. I tested it on my hand &amp; it last for a few hrs, even after washing my hands, so it&#x27;s definitely waterproof. It&#x27;s great for the price, just not the one I ordered, but this seller is great for making things right.</li>
            <li> I love the eyeliner, it is very smooth going on, makes just the perfect lines, and goes on just like I want:)</li>
            <li> Was completely dried out and horrible quality. It doesn&#x27;t even match the description! DO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner, not only is the bottle cute, but the felt tips work GREAT! It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes if it manages to get in there, and it survived a shower without coming off (until the face scrub of course)</li>
            <li> I immediately realized that this eyeliner isn&#x27;t waterproof. I seriously would not recommend this product. It is utter crap.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described and is a very good product.  Very impressed with quality and price!  Would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very effective.  Great long handle works well for me.  Would recommned this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this eyeliner because I wanted a fine tip application!! Being that the description stated \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; was a bonus for me!&lt;br /&gt;The fine tip application was wonderful! Went on smoothly with the freedom to detail my eyes just the way I wanted to. However it does not seem to be water proof, comes right off with a Q-tip and water.. The product shipped fast and was packaged well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I would reorder this product. But I am on a mission now to fine a true waterproof liquid fine point eyeliner for the upcoming summer!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps,&lt;br /&gt;JO</li>
            <li> Love this I had to order another</li>
            <li> The product is not the one pictured, I got a dried up pen like product. It&#x27;s nothing like this. Doesn&#x27;t even apply nicely to your eyes, you&#x27;d have to practically stab your eye out just to put a small amount of product on</li>
            <li> I Loved this product and I will be buying a lot more of it hopefully at the same price and in bulk if they have that!</li>
            <li> Great liner really thick and long lasting!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyeliner. It drys fast and makes great lines. It will not smudge or wear off.&lt;br /&gt;When it finally does come off it chips off like paint and I just have to peel it off slowly or use my makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;It is soooo much worth a dollar. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only side note is that a list of ingredients-in the eyeliner would be great with the product when shipped.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Packaging unappealing but product seems pretty adequate, long lasting and stays in place.  I think I like it despite its appearance.</li>
            <li> The makeup works better than I had hoped. It is waterproof and stays on unil I remove it. No more smudges or raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Liner glides on easily and remains in place for the entire day. I am very pleased with this product&lt;br /&gt;A great buy!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this liquid eyeliner.  Its almost foolproof!! THin or Thick lines, go on smoothly, lasts all day, great for everyday or dramatic lines. A little thrown off by the &amp;#34;bear&amp;#34; bottle it comes in, but this product is better than the expensive brands sold in department stores.  HIGHLY reccommeded!! WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!</li>
            <li> This product was cute and fun. It came fast and I got it within a week. The packaging is cute and decently sized. It works as well as a liquid liner you can get at a local drugstore. Its a bold black and holds up well throughout the day. As a beginner it was extremely easy to use. It&#x27;s not some amazing liner made for celebrities, but it&#x27;s decent and pretty much worth the price. It doesn&#x27;t burn or itch and it has a semi-hard felt tip. I would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> One of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever had! Not to mention, it comes in such a cute container!!! :)</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever but i love it, i thought it was going to be a teddy bear one but its still cute haven&#x27;t tried yet. I like how the tip is pointed  of the brush thing.</li>
            <li> Commodity excellent try it was very elegant and beautiful</li>
            <li> I knew it was good when I saw it. I love how I don&#x27;t mess up. But sometimes if your not careful it can be a bit of a mess to clean up.. Especially since it&#x27;s water proof.. So be careful using this..</li>
            <li> I love the felt tip. Its very accurate when you use it and very easy to use too. Also it stays for a long time!!</li>
            <li> loved my liners. stays on all day. don&#x27;t have to be retouching. goes on perfectly. would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Dramatic Black, dark eyeliner.  I work out alot, so it&#x27;s not completely waterproof or smudgeproof, but it does give it a good try.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times and really think it is a great product! I would recommend it for those summer days by the pool where you don&#x27;t want to smudge your eyes!</li>
            <li> This product is not waterproof.  It does not sting your eyes, but if your eyes water at all, it will be all over in your eyes.  If you are looking for a waterproof liner, This is NOT it.</li>
            <li> Its a great eyeliner.The wand is a perfect point for those who like a fine line.I will be buying again..thanks..:)</li>
            <li> This really is waterproof and is very easy to apply. The liner dries very quickly and it is true to color.  The packaging is cute.</li>
            <li> Seems like it would have been a great buy but this product can easily smudge. I wouldnt reccomend this. :(</li>
            <li> I like this product but it was dried out when i received it so i couldn&#x27;t  use it. The seller offord a was to fix it but i had already theown it away. Too bad, i was looking forward in using it.</li>
            <li> I would like to say the all night eyeliner is just like it says all night I love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;it works Great goes on real nice and doesn&#x27;t move. I went swimming with it on&lt;br /&gt;and it never came off. I also ride motorcycles and after the wind my eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;would be all over my eyes but not this stuff. I will be getting more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have always used cover girl that claimed it was water resistant but it actually was not by the second hour of wear it would be clumped in the corners of my eyes, but not this eye liner it is the best I have ever used. This will be my brand from now on.</li>
            <li> I will admit the tip is very hard, but the liner comes on perfectly and stays on!!! The liner doesn&#x27;t smear, Once it&#x27;s dry...it stays!!</li>
            <li> its great with the stiff brush but after a while it softens up.  Plus I notice after two weeks its starts to dry up.  Its great for the price.</li>
            <li> This item is so great love the tip on liner makes perfect lining every time and the container it comes in is so cute!</li>
            <li> the one thing i really loved about it, is when i apply it it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes which most of them do, and i go out with blood shot eyes which is not very attractive, so yes i like it alot.</li>
            <li> This item works REALLY well, and it got to me in only 3 days. The felt tip is really helpful and the eyeliner itself stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> definitely NOT waterproof.  this was a trick to get people to buy it.  false claim.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS EYELINER! I USE IT EVERYDAY NOTHING IS WRONG WITH IT. I ALSO BUY IT ALL THE TIME!!! IM IN LOVE! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> it was okay . it wasnt the best product .  it smudge when u take it out and leakes out . i wish it was better product .</li>
            <li> this eyeliner cost me 1 penny and it works better than my $20 lquid eyeliner!!! absolutely amazing! and the bottle is adorable!!</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for and this is not worth a dime. Cheap packaging and cheap product. I would defiantly not recommend ordering this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well!!!</li>
            <li> I got this water proof eye liner for my daugther she like the eye liner</li>
            <li> It works well, especially with my under eye eyeliner tray---stays put all day, without any sealant-Thankyou so much, jennifer Lil K</li>
            <li> Do not like... very hard to apply ...smears easily, could be good for younger steady hands but not mine. Try it</li>
            <li> This is a good item it went on smooth and lasted without cracking dry results ten hours later, It wasn&#x27;t there when I woke up so it isn&#x27;t as good  as the product I purchase normally. I would buy this again if the shipping wasn&#x27;t so high though</li>
            <li> This product works great. I love it. It works like its shown in the photo and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> i HAVE USED THIS LIQUID EYELINER EVERYDAY AND IT WORKS WELL AND DOES NOT SMUDGE. FOR .99 ITS EXCELLENT AND I RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive to most eyeliners. I was able to wear this eyeliner all day for at least eight hours with no issues or burning, itching, puffiness, or redness. Finally an eyeliner that I can wear on a daily basis and don&#x27;t have to worry about smugging it! The bottle is cute too!</li>
            <li> Love this eye liner! Been using it for over a year! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I got it today after waiting quite a bit. Totally worth the wait! I put it on very easily and it stayed on. The only thing is that I went swimming and my sister said it looked a tad smudged. No biggie, I still love it.</li>
            <li> weak color, does not last for more than an hour. It is not smudgeproof. Will notprchase again. However the shippng was excellent.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for I guess. It was very shiny and it looked cheap, it did not look smooth and almost seemed to bubble dry a bit. The bottle is cute but the product doesn&#x27;t last all day and definitely isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this was a felt tip... But it dries up quickly. Will not purchase again. Delivery was fast though!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different liquid eyeliners in the past, this is the first liner that has not stung when I painted it on eye lids. It goes on very smoothly and does not leave any chunks behind. It also lasts a very long time, I had this eyeliner on almost all day and kept it on through the night (oops) but it was still there in the morning with the exception of a few chips but was not smudged : ) I will for sure be purchasing more of this product in the future!</li>
            <li> I like this eye liner. It is easy to control and marks well. I like the felt tip much better then the brush tips. I wish they had more colors I would buy them.</li>
            <li> The tip was so hard I could not get it on my eye was afraid I would stab myself do not waste your money</li>
            <li> WILL SMUDGE EVEN THO ITS WATER PROOF</li>
            <li> This product sucks dick, I mean I guess it was worth the price but it came all dried up, and like nothing comes out. Not really worth to be honest, I&#x27;m probably just gonna throw it out, not worth the dollar or the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. When i bought it i thought that since it was not as expensive as the &amp;#34; high quality&amp;#34; eyeliner you  might  receive from Sephora, that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well. Ever since i got i have been looking back on the internet to find it. Ive never tried a better eyeliner. Absolutely great.</li>
            <li> these are cute, they are tiny but really cute, unfortunately they burned my eyes so i gave it to my daughter she liked it</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! I goes on great and stays on! The only problem is the tips seem to get ruined awfully fast.</li>
