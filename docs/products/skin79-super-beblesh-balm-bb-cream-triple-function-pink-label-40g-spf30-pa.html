            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t resist and tried the product, hoping that it would oxidize to match my medium-light complexion and was very glad when it did.</li>
            <li>and I believe it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;m going to get right now</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products, and the free samples are a great bonus!</li>

            <li>Love this BB cream!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but this stuff is about 100000 times better!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li>attractive, the pump is easy to use and hygenic</li>
            <li>It has a grayish color but it evens out skin tone and works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>It is a gloss BB cream, not matte, but with powder it looks great...or alone it looks amazing as well.</li>
            <li>This bb cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>And for the price it was amazing.</li>
            <li>cream is just amazing.</li>

            <li>Really nice product</li>
            <li>I have the Loreal kind &amp; maybelline</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great service!</li>
            <li>The main difference to me is that the gold version was a lot heavier/more moisturizing, which I think would be perfect for the winter or for drier skin types.</li>
            <li>When this is done oxidizing, it looks very fair and pretty.</li>
            <li>Very light, with good coverage, and has been my favorite foundation I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>The pump made it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Feels amazing going on, makes your skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>do expect more out of this product even though I said I liked it.</li>
            <li>and wow, was I impressed.</li>
            <li>packaging is very cute and the pump is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is great for light skin and light coverage.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, makes my skin feel soft and healthy..</li>
            <li>Awesome product,  Will order it again as it is much more natural than foundations.</li>
            <li>I am very light skinned.</li>
            <li>It makes my face very smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>But make sure you buy from an authentic dealer.</li>
            <li>When it arrived in the mail, I was pleased to find that they took the effort to bubble wrap the BB cream</li>
            <li>so I apply setting powder on top to keep the shine</li>
            <li>All I can say is: will buy more.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the fragrance was ever-so-slightly more perfumey than I remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this blog to be most helpful.</li>
            <li>However, I have examined this product and saw that it was, indeed, authentic.</li>
            <li>Thought I was paying for more product but not the case.</li>
            <li>Now my foundation has better coverage, staying power, doesn&#x27;t break up, doesn&#x27;t make face oily.</li>
            <li>It was way better than the product I have used.</li>
            <li>They sent a sample if the VIP gold balm and that worked better on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I need more coverage.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s also better to apply it with your fingers instead of a brush.</li>
            <li>After I use an oil-free pressed powder on top to give my face some color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>favorite thing about this bb cream is how well it controls the excess oil on my face.</li>
            <li>Oil control is better.</li>
            <li>I used this BB cream and like the texture, it also leaves a nice color, but it doesn&#x27;t keep my skin oil free which is the reason I bought this one.</li>
            <li>I love using this skin</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li>I use this bb cream for my every day make up routine and haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li>Most likely looks best with lighter skin complexions.</li>
            <li>My favorite makeup.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I know that a lot of people love EL&#x27;s but man, this one puts theirs to shame.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, lasts, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily!  </li>
            <li>The product can be layered to cover better</li>
            <li>ok so I was sceptical about well</li>
            <li>well yes! recieved mine today and absolutely love it because I already tried it.</li>
            <li>the cute thank</li>
            <li>you note and samples were also cute.</li>
            <li>and will be buying from this seller again soon :)</li>
            <li>I can wear this formula most of the work day.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love this BB cream more if it matched my skin better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that Maybelline&#x27;s bb cream matched my skin better in color, but Skin79&#x27;s product was much better in keeping my oily skin under control.</li>
            <li>I buy the Diamond Prestige BB crème by Skin 79 and love that product.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not too sure if I&#x27;ll be able to continue using this product.</li>
            <li>Better than foundation.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a while now my skin looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>I love that this takes care of a bunch of &amp;#34;necessary&amp;#34; skin steps in one step.</li>
            <li>w more coverage</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love that this has 25 SPF.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves such a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definately buying more ..</li>
            <li>It got to me a day after the latest  arrival date, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also arrived fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I really Love this cream..</li>
            <li>My mom who is very fair, my sister who is toasty colored, my aunt who is sienna, and my very tan self all get full coverage from this product.</li>
            <li>I think it is just that lightening and brightening that is so popular with the true BB creams that makes this product work so well for me.</li>
            <li>It was the origional product and not a fake from inspection, also it was really good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have medium light skin with yellow undertones and this product adjusts perfectly to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for when I want to go light on the makeup, especially during the summer months.  </li>
            <li>Very natural, skin feels great.</li>
            <li>When you apply it, it works best to dot it on the main areas of your face (cheeks, forehead, chin) and gently pat it in with your fingertips.</li>
            <li>This one seems to provide a bit better coverage and it feels and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>The price cheaper than other brands but the quality is perfect.</li>
            <li>It is my first time trying this brand of BB cream, so I am REALLY SATISFIED with the results!  </li>
            <li>but you could easily layer it.</li>
            <li>One step, easy and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I apply this product for special occasions and outings and it makes me feel so confident.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, very satisfied with the product and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>For those of us who have tan skin, a BB cream may seem like an iffy makeup product, but this particular BB cream seems to oxidize to fit just about any ivory fair to caramel tan skin tone.</li>
            <li>I tend to mix it with another foundation since this one is to light for it</li>
            <li>The coverage is light to medium</li>
            <li>It holds up really well in warm weather and even after working out.</li>
            <li>but yet I likes light coverage look and feel.</li>
            <li>Again this mixture helps me get that with a light coverage look a feel.</li>
            <li>Goes on so smooth</li>
            <li>, I have light skin</li>
            <li>Even after using it everyday I was blown away how great her face looked after applying it, she even ended up talking me out of my bottle!  </li>
            <li>Looks really smooth.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me break out and feels light on my face.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, doesn&#x27;t make me break out like everything else.</li>
            <li>Plus two free samples and a thank</li>
            <li>Fantastic BB cream.</li>
            <li>This product did not only work great but didn&#x27;t give me skin irritation or acne.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it gave me a dewy, natural skin look that wasn&#x27;t at all oily.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, Make sure you have the real one lots of fakes out there.</li>
            <li>I checked if it was real or not by look at the authentic label, perforated line, top, expiration date, etc and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to begin by saying that despite my own trouble with this particular product, I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I still think it&#x27;s great (just not for me!).</li>
            <li>The gold version was too rich for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>and I think they made the product a bit lighter than the original.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant breakouts.</li>
            <li>I love this BB crram so much!</li>
            <li>Very healthy and natural looking skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased my most recent bottle from Honest Skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian more in the ivory side and it does blend on my skin nicely if your darker complexion I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it does go on the whiter side.</li>
            <li>The color is just right for my skin tone, it has great SPF and light-weight enough to wear under foundation or just wear alone</li>
            <li>I have used skin79 oriental gold and it is very nice too but leaves my skin dry.</li>
            <li>I loved this makeup but the formula changed recently.</li>
            <li>This leaves a nice dewey finish and looks so natural.</li>
            <li>good for pictures as the SPF makes you turn white.</li>
            <li>It really would be a shame as I&#x27;ve enjoyed the smoothing and softening affect it&#x27;s had on my face.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with yellow undertones</li>
            <li>It is by far the best formula that I have found for people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I like it best when mixed with my regular foundation.</li>
            <li>SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>Hello Amazoners!&lt;br /&gt;I researched and researched before buying Skin79 Super+</li>
            <li>SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>This was my very first bb cream that I&#x27;ve purchased from skin79</li>
            <li>If you never used BB products don&#x27;t worry when you first apply and notice that it&#x27;s really a light shade, after 10-15 minutes the color matches your skin.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling oily or dry.</li>
            <li>This product is good for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product would work better for somebody with not sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, it takes it a minute or two though and matches pretty well to my fair Irish skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I received it before due date, it is nice!  </li>
            <li>The American ones are more of a glorified tinted moisturizer!</li>
            <li>It is very thick so use sparingly and under foundation it fills in pores, lines and wrinkles to leave your skin looking flawless.</li>
            <li>But I would put this on to have a fresh face all day.</li>
            <li>It is a bit thick and more fair.  </li>
            <li>I figured for the price, it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m asian and have fairly tan skin that gets oily very easily&lt;</li>
            <li>gave it 4/5 stars since it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone as greatly as I&#x27;d hoped, even though I&#x27;m fairly pale in color.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old, with combo skin, very fair and am hypervigilant about taking care of my skin due to years and years of battling the trauma of horrendous acne (which has subdued since I had my baby, thankfully!).&lt;br</li>
            <li>To really get a good idea of Korean bb creams, I suggest going to Musings of a Muse , she has quite a big collection and is very knowledgeable about Korean bb and cc creams!  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know what this bb cream is, then i reccomend it right away.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel like I look sickly right after applying</li>
            <li>This is my second Pink BB cream, it is very good</li>
            <li>have found that this also looks good on a wide variety of skin tones, including people who are much darker than me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It greatly improves my 65 year old fair skin; not only immediately, but 8 hours later and even after washing, the next day!</li>
            <li>I have mild acne that this covers really well without looking cakey or causing irritation.</li>
            <li>My skin is normally blotchy red, huge pores, many wrinkles and flakey.</li>
            <li>the color is very light for my skin, I tend to mix it with my moisturizer to sheer it out.</li>
            <li>This product shipped and arrived VERY fast...</li>
            <li>The color is light and natural.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying BB cream</li>
            <li>I find that this does have a greyish tint when you first apply it, but it will oxidize to match my light/medium skin.</li>
            <li>At first, I panicked because it didn&#x27;t have the holographic authenticity seal.</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;ll need a med to full coverage to get the staying power i need</li>
            <li>but it makes your skin smooth and natural.</li>
            <li>It is a bit drying, so I suggest applying moisturizer first.</li>
            <li>but I can deal with that since it covers up my scars pretty well.</li>
            <li>so I have to make sure I keep up on using face moisturizer, especially before using it.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ll admit my first impression was horror 0.0.</li>
            <li>It completely transformed to match my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Coverage - light to medium.</li>
            <li>It is real!</li>
            <li>It was pretty well packaged and came with the promised sample and a sample of a skinfood product.</li>
            <li>I also know that this is not a fake product that you hear about all the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It passed that test pretty well, though I&#x27;d still have to test it and see how that will go when wearing it during the Summer&#x27;s heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>feel so pretty wearing this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin and the benefits of SPF and overall skin</li>
            <li>When it was done blending, it suited my colour very well!</li>
            <li>Its pretty neat the way it blends to you skin</li>
            <li>Also it helps even up my skin tone so that was a plus ;)</li>
            <li>I know that some people have said that the pink one is a little whiter in color than the classic balm, this is true, but both blend in wonderfully</li>
            <li>I or previously use which was really affective and good feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also thicker than some other BB creams, so it covers nicely I don&#x27;t use any foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li>I was a bit scared that it wouldn&#x27;t be at first, but it truly seems real.</li>
            <li>Pink Gelee sells authentic skin79 because I checked and made sure, and I will definitely be ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Triple Function Hot Pink BB Cream is what I decided to buy because it seemed most compatible with my skin.</li>
            <li>I just use the Almay smart shade</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 3 months now and it has not broken me out.</li>
            <li>Everything else about my product matched up with the real stuff.</li>
            <li>As for the authenticity, i received a real bottle of bb cream.  </li>
            <li>Shippig was fast with prime but box was a bit damaged.</li>
            <li>The shipping seems fast to me.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone, scarred skin and it smoothed out my whole complexion.</li>
            <li>Was the real product.</li>
            <li>(they sell the real deal, BTW).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application - goes on like SPF and feels really oily</li>
            <li>: I came back after a few months of use to let you all know my skin looks better and feels better.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and</li>
            <li>far, I prefer this over the Maybelline Dream Fresh bb cream, but we&#x27;ll see how it goes when I try on the product in the daytime.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li>I tried this product, and I really do like it.</li>
            <li>that being said she still really like what the product did for her face.</li>
            <li>you can really see the differences.</li>
            <li>It ships from Korea and it is relatively fast shipping considering.</li>
            <li>Like it almost as much as my clinque foundation</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of heavy</li>
            <li>I liked this Bb cream, it&#x27;s a little heavy, but if you&#x27;re looking to make your complexion look better, this is it.</li>
            <li>The pink balm is also a little thicker than the classic balm and will give you a more even airbrushed finish that you would probably like better for a night out.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s generally cheap and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Even my husband and my 7 year old daughter complimented my skin after my first application.  </li>
            <li>I got scared at first because it seemed gray and natural but in couple minutes voila</li>
            <li>The coverage is light and needs some extra concealer over more trouble areas.</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad product.</li>
            <li>The price could be less other than that I was happy.</li>
            <li>Smooth to the touch without being too dry or too</li>
            <li>The more I use the product the less</li>
            <li>I get a better skin match and hide slight imperfections.</li>
            <li>The consistency is kind of like a thick gel, but spreads and blends really well on your skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get super oily until maybe 8 to 10 hrs later.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It also makes the little hairs on my face more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m really basing it off of what I have tried so far</li>
            <li>It makes me so much whiter than the old bottle I had.</li>
            <li>so far I think it is real.</li>
            <li>First, the seller was very prompt with shipping so the BB cream arrived in about a week from the purchase date (2 weeks earlier than the estimated date!).</li>
            <li>My face is normally oily  after 10hrs, makeup slides off</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin and</li>
            <li>and i use it everyday :)</li>
            <li>This was the new bottle</li>
            <li>- I just got a new box of BB Cream.</li>
            <li>I ran out of the BB cream and had to buy a new foundation from the store while awaiting for my BB cream to get here in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sharing this new product info with everyone i know.  </li>
            <li>It is a good size, larger than just a tube of BB cream, and you only need to use half of a dime size in order to cover your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It brightens my face and has a very natural look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems pretty likely to me that the manufacturer did indeed change up the packaging for 2013.</li>
            <li>but I suggest a light concealer until your dark spots lighten a little.&lt;br /&gt;Finish</li>
            <li>I bought the Pink BB cream from Pink Gelee and after much research, I can verify that it is truly the authentic product.</li>
            <li>This BB cream provides complete coverage of all skin imperfections!  </li>
            <li>Everything else is authentic, I&#x27;m just not sure about the change of word...</li>
            <li>love this product use everyday!</li>
            <li>I will only use this bb cream in the future, It is light weight and looks natural on my face.</li>
            <li>and it is very buildable and never looks cakey, which I find normal foundations gets cakey after a 2nd layer.</li>
            <li>I tried it on a bit last night and the color seemed a bit too light at first, but it slowly but surely got a little darker.</li>
            <li>I can say that my large pores have gotten smaller and that my complexion is getting evened out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this several times on Amazon, it&#x27;s a little more than I&#x27;d like to spend, but I love the product and it lasts at least a couple months.</li>
            <li>The product I received was clearly counterfeit.</li>
            <li>It claims to control sebum and help clear skin</li>
            <li>This combination of skin care has helped my skin clear up, my complexion even out, and my confidence soar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bb cream is also very moisturizing but lightweight at the same time.</li>
            <li>I use a kabuki brush to get an even and complete coverage.</li>
            <li>far as coverage goes, this can have low-medium coverage.</li>
            <li>: I bought this early April and have been using often until this review (July 5th).</li>
            <li>My pores have gotten sooo much smaller and my skin tone is very evened out now.</li>
            <li>My pores have gotten sooo much smaller and my skin tone is very evened out now.</li>
            <li>This one is a lot smoother and natural looking.</li>
            <li>It does make me look a bit lighter than my natural skin tone</li>
            <li>I have tried to completely cover them with the product</li>
            <li>Also my white heads become very noticeable with it</li>
            <li>and you will need some cotton balls to even out the make up near the chin and eyes.</li>
            <li>To mention again, it caused irritation and a bit of burning, but my skin is sensitive to Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>is it really that low?</li>
            <li>This cream is on the light side, but after a few moments, it darkens up to get closer to my skin colour.</li>
            <li>I had seen an article in an old magazine and figured I&#x27;d try this</li>
            <li>I have 64 year old skin</li>
            <li>I appreciated the free shipping, and they threw in 4 samples (2 hot pink, 1 black, 1 white).</li>
            <li>I like the pump design which leaves no mess.  </li>
            <li>It comes on grey but within minutes, it oxides to match a wide range of skin tones between light to medium.</li>
            <li>BB Triple Function Hot Pink BB Cream.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Pink BB cream first, but after reading the reviews I also ordered the Gold one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the bb cream craze and had actually tried the Maybelline BB Cream from the USA, but I noticed my skin getting oily/shiny within an hour of using the Maybelline bb cream even with setting powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed that if I don&#x27;t moisturize or exfoliate first, that the dry skin around my nose becomes obvious when using this bb</li>
            <li>Skin79&#x27;s product is definitely thicker and less watery on application, but it was indeed lighter than the Maybelline&#x27;s \\&quot;Light Sheer tint\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth to put on but be ware of too much a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>It gives you clear looking skiing and last all day</li>
            <li>The dark spots that I couldn&#x27;t cover at first with just the BB cream are now manageble with just the cream alone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a little light for me, so I mix with a little normal foundation and it works well.</li>
            <li>If the color is a little off, try the gold or some of the other options you can get, but I swear by this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I covered some on half of my face at first</li>
            <li>Thanks Pink Gelee!</li>
            <li>Actually, it helped improve my acne problems and removed my old red acne marks and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I tried the classic balm and the pink skin79 BB cream.</li>
            <li>The texture is thick and creamy enough that it doesn&#x27;t run and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Who wants to purchase something that&#x27;s not right for them?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it covers dark spots or hides acne very well, but it does hide the redness around my cheek/nose area (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may look greyish at first, but it adjusts to your skintone in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>When applying this product on your face, it might be pale at first but it will oxidize to your skin color.</li>
            <li>Since this was made on July 9, 2012 (pretty recent), I was wondering if this is a new change the real Skin79 made...or if this can be fake.</li>
            <li>Easy to thin with a lil moisturizer in the summer.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is evened out for the most part and appears less dull than it did before.</li>
            <li>I am naturally pretty pale with blue undertones.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too much!</li>

            <li> I have the Loreal kind &amp; maybelline</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great service!</li>
            <li> The main difference to me is that the gold version was a lot heavier/more moisturizing, which I think would be perfect for the winter or for drier skin types.</li>
            <li> When this is done oxidizing, it looks very fair and pretty.</li>
            <li> Very light, with good coverage, and has been my favorite foundation I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>

            <li> packaging is very cute and the pump is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is great for light skin and light coverage.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, makes my skin feel soft and healthy..</li>
            <li> Awesome product,  Will order it again as it is much more natural than foundations.</li>
            <li> I am very light skinned.</li>
            <li> It makes my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> But make sure you buy from an authentic dealer.</li>
            <li> When it arrived in the mail, I was pleased to find that they took the effort to bubble wrap the BB cream</li>
            <li> so I apply setting powder on top to keep the shine</li>
            <li> All I can say is: will buy more.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the fragrance was ever-so-slightly more perfumey than I remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this blog to be most helpful.</li>
            <li> However, I have examined this product and saw that it was, indeed, authentic.</li>
            <li> Thought I was paying for more product but not the case.</li>
            <li> Now my foundation has better coverage, staying power, doesn&#x27;t break up, doesn&#x27;t make face oily.</li>
            <li> It was way better than the product I have used.</li>
            <li> They sent a sample if the VIP gold balm and that worked better on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I need more coverage.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s also better to apply it with your fingers instead of a brush.</li>
            <li> After I use an oil-free pressed powder on top to give my face some color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> favorite thing about this bb cream is how well it controls the excess oil on my face.</li>
            <li> Oil control is better.</li>
            <li> I used this BB cream and like the texture, it also leaves a nice color, but it doesn&#x27;t keep my skin oil free which is the reason I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I love using this skin</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li> I use this bb cream for my every day make up routine and haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> Most likely looks best with lighter skin complexions.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I know that a lot of people love EL&#x27;s but man, this one puts theirs to shame.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, lasts, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily!  </li>
            <li> The product can be layered to cover better</li>
            <li> ok so I was sceptical about well</li>
            <li> well yes! recieved mine today and absolutely love it because I already tried it.</li>
            <li> the cute thank</li>
            <li> you note and samples were also cute.</li>
            <li> and will be buying from this seller again soon :)</li>
            <li> I can wear this formula most of the work day.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love this BB cream more if it matched my skin better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that Maybelline&#x27;s bb cream matched my skin better in color, but Skin79&#x27;s product was much better in keeping my oily skin under control.</li>
            <li> I buy the Diamond Prestige BB crème by Skin 79 and love that product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not too sure if I&#x27;ll be able to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Better than foundation.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a while now my skin looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> I love that this takes care of a bunch of &amp;#34;necessary&amp;#34; skin steps in one step.</li>
            <li> w more coverage</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love that this has 25 SPF.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves such a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definately buying more ..</li>
            <li> It got to me a day after the latest  arrival date, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also arrived fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I really Love this cream..</li>
            <li> My mom who is very fair, my sister who is toasty colored, my aunt who is sienna, and my very tan self all get full coverage from this product.</li>
            <li> I think it is just that lightening and brightening that is so popular with the true BB creams that makes this product work so well for me.</li>
            <li> It was the origional product and not a fake from inspection, also it was really good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have medium light skin with yellow undertones and this product adjusts perfectly to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for when I want to go light on the makeup, especially during the summer months.  </li>
            <li> Very natural, skin feels great.</li>
            <li> When you apply it, it works best to dot it on the main areas of your face (cheeks, forehead, chin) and gently pat it in with your fingertips.</li>
            <li> This one seems to provide a bit better coverage and it feels and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> The price cheaper than other brands but the quality is perfect.</li>
            <li> It is my first time trying this brand of BB cream, so I am REALLY SATISFIED with the results!  </li>
            <li> but you could easily layer it.</li>
            <li> One step, easy and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I apply this product for special occasions and outings and it makes me feel so confident.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, very satisfied with the product and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> For those of us who have tan skin, a BB cream may seem like an iffy makeup product, but this particular BB cream seems to oxidize to fit just about any ivory fair to caramel tan skin tone.</li>
            <li> I tend to mix it with another foundation since this one is to light for it</li>
            <li> The coverage is light to medium</li>
            <li> It holds up really well in warm weather and even after working out.</li>
            <li> but yet I likes light coverage look and feel.</li>
            <li> Again this mixture helps me get that with a light coverage look a feel.</li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth</li>
            <li> , I have light skin</li>
            <li> Even after using it everyday I was blown away how great her face looked after applying it, she even ended up talking me out of my bottle!  </li>
            <li> Looks really smooth.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out and feels light on my face.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, doesn&#x27;t make me break out like everything else.</li>
            <li> Plus two free samples and a thank</li>
            <li> Fantastic BB cream.</li>
            <li> This product did not only work great but didn&#x27;t give me skin irritation or acne.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it gave me a dewy, natural skin look that wasn&#x27;t at all oily.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, Make sure you have the real one lots of fakes out there.</li>
            <li> I checked if it was real or not by look at the authentic label, perforated line, top, expiration date, etc and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to begin by saying that despite my own trouble with this particular product, I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I still think it&#x27;s great (just not for me!).</li>
            <li> The gold version was too rich for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> and I think they made the product a bit lighter than the original.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this BB crram so much!</li>
            <li> Very healthy and natural looking skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased my most recent bottle from Honest Skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian more in the ivory side and it does blend on my skin nicely if your darker complexion I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it does go on the whiter side.</li>
            <li> The color is just right for my skin tone, it has great SPF and light-weight enough to wear under foundation or just wear alone</li>
            <li> I have used skin79 oriental gold and it is very nice too but leaves my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I loved this makeup but the formula changed recently.</li>
            <li> This leaves a nice dewey finish and looks so natural.</li>
            <li> good for pictures as the SPF makes you turn white.</li>
            <li> It really would be a shame as I&#x27;ve enjoyed the smoothing and softening affect it&#x27;s had on my face.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with yellow undertones</li>
            <li> It is by far the best formula that I have found for people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like it best when mixed with my regular foundation.</li>
            <li> SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> Hello Amazoners!&lt;br /&gt;I researched and researched before buying Skin79 Super+</li>
            <li> SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> This was my very first bb cream that I&#x27;ve purchased from skin79</li>
            <li> If you never used BB products don&#x27;t worry when you first apply and notice that it&#x27;s really a light shade, after 10-15 minutes the color matches your skin.  </li>
            <li> Good coverage and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling oily or dry.</li>
            <li> This product is good for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product would work better for somebody with not sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , it takes it a minute or two though and matches pretty well to my fair Irish skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I received it before due date, it is nice!  </li>
            <li> The American ones are more of a glorified tinted moisturizer!</li>
            <li> It is very thick so use sparingly and under foundation it fills in pores, lines and wrinkles to leave your skin looking flawless.</li>
            <li> But I would put this on to have a fresh face all day.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick and more fair.  </li>
            <li> I figured for the price, it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m asian and have fairly tan skin that gets oily very easily&lt;</li>
            <li> gave it 4/5 stars since it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone as greatly as I&#x27;d hoped, even though I&#x27;m fairly pale in color.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, with combo skin, very fair and am hypervigilant about taking care of my skin due to years and years of battling the trauma of horrendous acne (which has subdued since I had my baby, thankfully!).&lt;br</li>
            <li> To really get a good idea of Korean bb creams, I suggest going to Musings of a Muse , she has quite a big collection and is very knowledgeable about Korean bb and cc creams!  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know what this bb cream is, then i reccomend it right away.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like I look sickly right after applying</li>
            <li> This is my second Pink BB cream, it is very good</li>
            <li> have found that this also looks good on a wide variety of skin tones, including people who are much darker than me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It greatly improves my 65 year old fair skin; not only immediately, but 8 hours later and even after washing, the next day!</li>
            <li> I have mild acne that this covers really well without looking cakey or causing irritation.</li>
            <li> My skin is normally blotchy red, huge pores, many wrinkles and flakey.</li>
            <li> the color is very light for my skin, I tend to mix it with my moisturizer to sheer it out.</li>
            <li> This product shipped and arrived VERY fast...</li>
            <li> The color is light and natural.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying BB cream</li>
            <li> I find that this does have a greyish tint when you first apply it, but it will oxidize to match my light/medium skin.</li>
            <li> At first, I panicked because it didn&#x27;t have the holographic authenticity seal.</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;ll need a med to full coverage to get the staying power i need</li>
            <li> but it makes your skin smooth and natural.</li>
            <li> It is a bit drying, so I suggest applying moisturizer first.</li>
            <li> but I can deal with that since it covers up my scars pretty well.</li>
            <li> so I have to make sure I keep up on using face moisturizer, especially before using it.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ll admit my first impression was horror 0.0.</li>
            <li> It completely transformed to match my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Coverage - light to medium.</li>
            <li> It is real!</li>
            <li> It was pretty well packaged and came with the promised sample and a sample of a skinfood product.</li>
            <li> I also know that this is not a fake product that you hear about all the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It passed that test pretty well, though I&#x27;d still have to test it and see how that will go when wearing it during the Summer&#x27;s heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> feel so pretty wearing this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my skin and the benefits of SPF and overall skin</li>
            <li> When it was done blending, it suited my colour very well!</li>
            <li> Its pretty neat the way it blends to you skin</li>
            <li> Also it helps even up my skin tone so that was a plus ;)</li>
            <li> I know that some people have said that the pink one is a little whiter in color than the classic balm, this is true, but both blend in wonderfully</li>
            <li> I or previously use which was really affective and good feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also thicker than some other BB creams, so it covers nicely I don&#x27;t use any foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared that it wouldn&#x27;t be at first, but it truly seems real.</li>
            <li> Pink Gelee sells authentic skin79 because I checked and made sure, and I will definitely be ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Triple Function Hot Pink BB Cream is what I decided to buy because it seemed most compatible with my skin.</li>
            <li> I just use the Almay smart shade</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 3 months now and it has not broken me out.</li>
            <li> Everything else about my product matched up with the real stuff.</li>
            <li> As for the authenticity, i received a real bottle of bb cream.  </li>
            <li> Shippig was fast with prime but box was a bit damaged.</li>
            <li> The shipping seems fast to me.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone, scarred skin and it smoothed out my whole complexion.</li>
            <li> Was the real product.</li>
            <li> (they sell the real deal, BTW).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application - goes on like SPF and feels really oily</li>
            <li> : I came back after a few months of use to let you all know my skin looks better and feels better.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and</li>
            <li> far, I prefer this over the Maybelline Dream Fresh bb cream, but we&#x27;ll see how it goes when I try on the product in the daytime.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li> I tried this product, and I really do like it.</li>
            <li> that being said she still really like what the product did for her face.</li>
            <li> you can really see the differences.</li>
            <li> It ships from Korea and it is relatively fast shipping considering.</li>
            <li> Like it almost as much as my clinque foundation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of heavy</li>
            <li> I liked this Bb cream, it&#x27;s a little heavy, but if you&#x27;re looking to make your complexion look better, this is it.</li>
            <li> The pink balm is also a little thicker than the classic balm and will give you a more even airbrushed finish that you would probably like better for a night out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s generally cheap and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Even my husband and my 7 year old daughter complimented my skin after my first application.  </li>
            <li> I got scared at first because it seemed gray and natural but in couple minutes voila</li>
            <li> The coverage is light and needs some extra concealer over more trouble areas.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad product.</li>
            <li> The price could be less other than that I was happy.</li>
            <li> Smooth to the touch without being too dry or too</li>
            <li> The more I use the product the less</li>
            <li> I get a better skin match and hide slight imperfections.</li>
            <li> The consistency is kind of like a thick gel, but spreads and blends really well on your skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get super oily until maybe 8 to 10 hrs later.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> It also makes the little hairs on my face more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m really basing it off of what I have tried so far</li>
            <li> It makes me so much whiter than the old bottle I had.</li>
            <li> so far I think it is real.</li>
            <li> First, the seller was very prompt with shipping so the BB cream arrived in about a week from the purchase date (2 weeks earlier than the estimated date!).</li>
            <li> My face is normally oily  after 10hrs, makeup slides off</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin and</li>
            <li> and i use it everyday :)</li>
            <li> This was the new bottle</li>
            <li> - I just got a new box of BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the BB cream and had to buy a new foundation from the store while awaiting for my BB cream to get here in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sharing this new product info with everyone i know.  </li>
            <li> It is a good size, larger than just a tube of BB cream, and you only need to use half of a dime size in order to cover your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It brightens my face and has a very natural look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems pretty likely to me that the manufacturer did indeed change up the packaging for 2013.</li>
            <li> but I suggest a light concealer until your dark spots lighten a little.&lt;br /&gt;Finish</li>
            <li> I bought the Pink BB cream from Pink Gelee and after much research, I can verify that it is truly the authentic product.</li>
            <li> This BB cream provides complete coverage of all skin imperfections!  </li>
            <li> Everything else is authentic, I&#x27;m just not sure about the change of word...</li>
            <li> love this product use everyday!</li>
            <li> I will only use this bb cream in the future, It is light weight and looks natural on my face.</li>
            <li> and it is very buildable and never looks cakey, which I find normal foundations gets cakey after a 2nd layer.</li>
            <li> I tried it on a bit last night and the color seemed a bit too light at first, but it slowly but surely got a little darker.</li>
            <li> I can say that my large pores have gotten smaller and that my complexion is getting evened out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this several times on Amazon, it&#x27;s a little more than I&#x27;d like to spend, but I love the product and it lasts at least a couple months.</li>
            <li> The product I received was clearly counterfeit.</li>
            <li> It claims to control sebum and help clear skin</li>
            <li> This combination of skin care has helped my skin clear up, my complexion even out, and my confidence soar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bb cream is also very moisturizing but lightweight at the same time.</li>
            <li> I use a kabuki brush to get an even and complete coverage.</li>
            <li> far as coverage goes, this can have low-medium coverage.</li>
            <li> : I bought this early April and have been using often until this review (July 5th).</li>
            <li> My pores have gotten sooo much smaller and my skin tone is very evened out now.</li>
            <li> My pores have gotten sooo much smaller and my skin tone is very evened out now.</li>
            <li> This one is a lot smoother and natural looking.</li>
            <li> It does make me look a bit lighter than my natural skin tone</li>
            <li> I have tried to completely cover them with the product</li>
            <li> Also my white heads become very noticeable with it</li>
            <li> and you will need some cotton balls to even out the make up near the chin and eyes.</li>
            <li> To mention again, it caused irritation and a bit of burning, but my skin is sensitive to Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> is it really that low?</li>
            <li> This cream is on the light side, but after a few moments, it darkens up to get closer to my skin colour.</li>
            <li> I had seen an article in an old magazine and figured I&#x27;d try this</li>
            <li> I have 64 year old skin</li>
            <li> I appreciated the free shipping, and they threw in 4 samples (2 hot pink, 1 black, 1 white).</li>
            <li> I like the pump design which leaves no mess.  </li>
            <li> It comes on grey but within minutes, it oxides to match a wide range of skin tones between light to medium.</li>
            <li> BB Triple Function Hot Pink BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Pink BB cream first, but after reading the reviews I also ordered the Gold one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the bb cream craze and had actually tried the Maybelline BB Cream from the USA, but I noticed my skin getting oily/shiny within an hour of using the Maybelline bb cream even with setting powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that if I don&#x27;t moisturize or exfoliate first, that the dry skin around my nose becomes obvious when using this bb</li>
            <li> Skin79&#x27;s product is definitely thicker and less watery on application, but it was indeed lighter than the Maybelline&#x27;s \\&quot;Light Sheer tint\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth to put on but be ware of too much a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It gives you clear looking skiing and last all day</li>
            <li> The dark spots that I couldn&#x27;t cover at first with just the BB cream are now manageble with just the cream alone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a little light for me, so I mix with a little normal foundation and it works well.</li>
            <li> If the color is a little off, try the gold or some of the other options you can get, but I swear by this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I covered some on half of my face at first</li>
            <li> Thanks Pink Gelee!</li>
            <li> Actually, it helped improve my acne problems and removed my old red acne marks and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I tried the classic balm and the pink skin79 BB cream.</li>
            <li> The texture is thick and creamy enough that it doesn&#x27;t run and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Who wants to purchase something that&#x27;s not right for them?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it covers dark spots or hides acne very well, but it does hide the redness around my cheek/nose area (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may look greyish at first, but it adjusts to your skintone in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> When applying this product on your face, it might be pale at first but it will oxidize to your skin color.</li>
            <li> Since this was made on July 9, 2012 (pretty recent), I was wondering if this is a new change the real Skin79 made...or if this can be fake.</li>
            <li> Easy to thin with a lil moisturizer in the summer.  </li>
            <li> My complexion is evened out for the most part and appears less dull than it did before.</li>
            <li> I am naturally pretty pale with blue undertones.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> It looked lovely, however it felt very heavy and slick on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of discoloration due to sun spots but other than that don&#x27;t need much cover.</li>
            <li> and I still need to use powder or a little conclear to make it blend with my skin tone which is normal</li>
            <li> The only downside to this is the color, it is rather grey and darker than my NC 5-10 skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels thick when you first pump it out</li>
            <li> - the thick SPF feel worried me at first (after all I have oily skin)</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with foundations and bb creams clinging to dry patches, or looking very obvious on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely a must have for those who like bb creams, and especially those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I usually wear ivory to classic ivory make-up because I&#x27;m pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THe color looks grey and doesnt blend with your skin like its supposed to.</li>
            <li> This product also lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> just received my shipment of skin79 pink bb cream and had to try it out the same night.</li>
            <li> I knew it would start out a yucky grey like molding clay, but I was also worried about the brownish undertones.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews, initially when you apply it on your face, it does give you a grayish tint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stays on all day in 80 degree, dry weather.</li>
            <li> However, my aunt used it and she has really dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also stopped using conventional moisturizers at night, instead I just use Extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it has a slight grey tint after application.</li>
            <li> I have tried a  few other BB Creams but they do not look natural at all, it&#x27;s like my face is caked on with dry make up no matter what I do to accommodate it.</li>
            <li> This product will not cover everything; like dark red scars and under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that the authentic label says &#x27;VOID&#x27; very faintly under the words.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll remember to update this later down the road to see if Skin79&#x27;s bb cream actually smoothes out the freckles and dark spots I have on my skin as touted by their advertisements ^_^</li>
            <li> So I narrowed down my search and finally decided to buy from SeoulGlamour</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so this will last a while.  </li>
            <li> The coverage isn&#x27;t very heavy -- something I was expecting and counting on -- and gave a natural finish that evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look a tone whiter and not at all dry, like I&#x27;m not wearing any product!</li>
            <li> It does fade dark spots but not completely and it takes a long time to notice.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this with the fact that I am a very pale, highly sensitive ginger girl.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> grey color didn&#x27;t last, it did self adjust to my pale skin tone.</li>
            <li> Covers just enough but not full coverage</li>
            <li> All the little extra gaps my foundation couldn&#x27;t do, this fixes.</li>
            <li> The Maybelline stuff smells strongly of perfume, thin and runny, doesn&#x27;t help my red marks, and makes me break out even worse, and don&#x27;t even get me started on the other drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> but it blends crazy smooth</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than i expected...</li>
            <li> I had been curious to try this product, with all the buzz about it.</li>
            <li> Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label )</li>
            <li> I ordered mine from pink gelee, and  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order from anyone else from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a foundation person, so I decided to try BB cream.</li>
            <li> Received within just a few days (maybe 3 total)...</li>
            <li> The pink one I leave at home for when i do my makeup before i go out.</li>
            <li> so there really is no difference.</li>
            <li> On days that I don&#x27;t use this, my cheek and nose area gets very (I mean VERY</li>
            <li> Only problem is you have to blend it in well or people will criticize for how pale your face it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews</li>
            <li> texture and feel is the same as other bottles I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m dying to try the other skin79 bb</li>
            <li> It looks gray and weird at first.</li>
            <li> And it hides the dark skin and makes my eyes look normal and not look tired.</li>
            <li> I looked up all the differences between the real versus fake stuff online.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t cover up your acne scars or your dark circle.</li>
            <li> They both said the BB cream even out my skin tone and covered up my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> This product is not worth buying.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Loreal Youth Code BB, but it was too dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very worried that this might be a fake</li>
            <li> And I have very dark under eye skin tone due sinus problems and iron deficiency.</li>
            <li> It oxidizes within a few minutes vrs other BB creams that take 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> It has less coverage, gets oily and cakey after just two hours</li>
            <li> I would give it a four and half</li>
            <li> It will however make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricier but seems like I will use less</li>
            <li> I say get both, ordering two of these balms costs way less than one BB cream at sephora.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, in the images, whether real or fake, says &#x27;WRINKLE FREE&#x27; after SPF 25 PA++.</li>
            <li> , just a little goes a lo way for cover up...</li>
            <li> Finish off with a little powder and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it felt little greasy but that will change after awhile</li>
            <li> The new foundation from the store does not compare and I was frustrated as it took my about 15 minutes to fix my face where the BB cream only takes me like 2 minutes, then add mascara</li>
            <li> and I will use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I thought \\&quot;wow, I just received a fake product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s supposed to oxidize and match your skin tone in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> I have rather oily skin with a few blemishes.</li>
            <li> I was also concerned that it would leave me shiny after a few hours since I have combination/oily skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it a few times, I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t quite match my complexion when it oxidizes.</li>
            <li> My mom used some and she has a pale complexion, but it also works for her face too.</li>
            <li> I hate sweating and showing up somewhere with a red face (I live in about 108° weather).</li>
            <li> : Haven&#x27;t been using it often since I purchased, but I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for the past 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the last one I bought for myself, the pump stopped working after a few uses...</li>
            <li> With this on my face I get very little oil</li>
            <li> : After looking at it again, I could scratch off the silver-rainbow &#x27;BB&#x27; on the bottle if I attack a small spot with my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and this bb cream blends in well.</li>
            <li> Made my skin burn and texture was weird, it did go on grey and come out my skin color</li>
            <li> It feels fake and really dry on skin.</li>
            <li> in so you have to shake it around or take it apart (which isn&#x27;t too hard) and use something like a stick to take the product out.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick, so it covers everything.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Consistancy - thick, feels like SPF moisturizer</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical that when I&#x27;d finally receive the bb cream it would be a fake.</li>
            <li> I had hear a lot of negative things about this brand of BB because of a lot of fake replications being made.</li>
            <li> Everything she tried was irritating it.</li>
            <li> In between I tried a couple of samples of other BB creams, and was immediately disappointed after experiencing the moisture and coverage of this one.  </li>
            <li> I have used American drugstore brand BB creams afterward (when they all came out) and been very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So sad that I will have to look for something else.</li>
            <li> Caution with buying from random sellers with questionable ratings, there are a lot of fakes out there</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical and thought I might breakout from using this BB cream.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> wil it be real or a fake?</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and a history of bad acne, so I typically hate putting skin products on my face since they tend to clog your pores throughout the day (creams, lotions, sunscreen, foundation, etc).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Consistency and coverage of product were awful...</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst products I have bought and it has no smell like the ones</li>
            <li> or it makes me break out into horrible acne.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this BB cream. Makes my skin looks naturally flawless. I don&#x27;t wear makeup on a daily basis. But I would put this on to have a fresh face all day. It oxidizes within a few minutes vrs other BB creams that take 15-20 minutes. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and it lasts me quite some time. A little goes a long way. But make sure you buy from an authentic dealer. There&#x27;s a lot of fraudulent products out there.</li>
            <li> Good coverage and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling oily or dry. Love it!!Smells good and doesn&#x27;t produce any breakouts in my skin. I tend to mix it with another foundation since this one is to light for it and it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of recommendations online about this BB cream, that&#x27;s why I bought it online. The price cheaper than other brands but the quality is perfect. The color is light and natural. I like it and I will use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than i expected... And the formula just blends well in my skin., just a little goes a lo way for cover up...</li>
            <li> First, the seller was very prompt with shipping so the BB cream arrived in about a week from the purchase date (2 weeks earlier than the estimated date!). When it arrived in the mail, I was pleased to find that they took the effort to bubble wrap the BB cream so everything was nice and safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the product itself is wonderful! This is my first time trying BB cream and I find myself using it almost every time I do my makeup. The coverage is light to medium and it is very buildable and never looks cakey, which I find normal foundations gets cakey after a 2nd layer. The bb cream is also very moisturizing but lightweight at the same time. The consistency is kind of like a thick gel, but spreads and blends really well on your skin. I find that this does have a greyish tint when you first apply it, but it will oxidize to match my light/medium skin. I also have oily/combination skin so I apply setting powder on top to keep the shine away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 3 months now and it has not broken me out. It holds up really well in warm weather and even after working out. At the time, this seller threw in the Gold BB cream sample pack. The main difference to me is that the gold version was a lot heavier/more moisturizing, which I think would be perfect for the winter or for drier skin types. The gold version was too rich for my oily skin. Either way, Skin79&#x27;s BB creams work wonders and I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I received it before due date, it is nice!  Reading other reviews I learned you do not rub this in you pat it in, a small amount will cover your whole face!  To really get a good idea of Korean bb creams, I suggest going to Musings of a Muse , she has quite a big collection and is very knowledgeable about Korean bb and cc creams!  The American ones are more of a glorified tinted moisturizer!</li>
            <li> For those of us who have tan skin, a BB cream may seem like an iffy makeup product, but this particular BB cream seems to oxidize to fit just about any ivory fair to caramel tan skin tone. My mom who is very fair, my sister who is toasty colored, my aunt who is sienna, and my very tan self all get full coverage from this product. The product after initial application is greyish and oxides to match the color of skin in minutes. I apply this product for special occasions and outings and it makes me feel so confident. I use a kabuki brush to get an even and complete coverage. It works well for people of all ages (so it seems). All I can say is: will buy more.</li>
            <li> I purchased my most recent bottle from Honest Skin. At first, I panicked because it didn&#x27;t have the holographic authenticity seal. I thought \\&quot;wow, I just received a fake product.\\&quot; I looked up all the differences between the real versus fake stuff online. Mine was lacking the stickers on both the box and the bottle, as well as the perforations on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I came across a couple blogs which mentioned that Skin79 no longer has the sticker seals on their product, beginning in 2013. Everything else about my product matched up with the real stuff. There are instructions printed in 4 languages on the inside of the box, something the fakes don&#x27;t bother to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture and feel is the same as other bottles I&#x27;ve had in the past. I did notice that the fragrance was ever-so-slightly more perfumey than I remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems pretty likely to me that the manufacturer did indeed change up the packaging for 2013. I found this blog to be most helpful. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I had hear a lot of negative things about this brand of BB because of a lot of fake replications being made. However, I have examined this product and saw that it was, indeed, authentic. I use this product every morning. It is great for light skin and light coverage. Feels amazing going on, makes your skin feel very smooth. One of my favorite products, and the free samples are a great bonus!</li>
            <li> Not what its seems to be. Thought I was paying for more product but not the case. Look to pictures for example.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know what this bb cream is, then i reccomend it right away.  Best bb creams out of the many that i have tried.  It has a grayish color but it evens out skin tone and works amazingly.  It is a bit thick and more fair.  As for the authenticity, i received a real bottle of bb cream.  Shippig was fast with prime but box was a bit damaged.</li>
            <li> I had been curious to try this product, with all the buzz about it. I figured for the price, it was worth a try. When you apply it, it works best to dot it on the main areas of your face (cheeks, forehead, chin) and gently pat it in with your fingertips. It may look greyish at first, but it adjusts to your skintone in a few minutes. It stayed on well and didn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vendor also worked well for me. I appreciated the free shipping, and they threw in 4 samples (2 hot pink, 1 black, 1 white). I plan on giving them to friends and family. They also threw in a business card thanking me for their purchase. Thanks Pink Gelee!</li>
            <li> Dont like the color that it gives, It also made me break out , i thought it would help with my acne. THe color looks grey and doesnt blend with your skin like its supposed to.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I like it best when mixed with my regular foundation. All the little extra gaps my foundation couldn&#x27;t do, this fixes. Now my foundation has better coverage, staying power, doesn&#x27;t break up, doesn&#x27;t make face oily. My face is normally oily  after 10hrs, makeup slides off but yet I likes light coverage look and feel. Normally I&#x27;ll need a med to full coverage to get the staying power i need but I don&#x27;t like that look. Again this mixture helps me get that with a light coverage look a feel.</li>
            <li> I loved this makeup but the formula changed recently. I&#x27;m so disappointed!! It has less coverage, gets oily and cakey after just two hours and I&#x27;ve been breaking out since I started using it. So sad that I will have to look for something else.</li>
            <li> I liked this Bb cream, it&#x27;s a little heavy, but if you&#x27;re looking to make your complexion look better, this is it. A little goes a long way. The pump made it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The shipping seems fast to me. I got the product in 3 days.The product did its job.  It was way better than the product I have used. This product doesn&#x27;t give me acne or oily face. the whitening actually works on me.  My face became whiter. This product doesn&#x27;t cover up your acne scars or your dark circle. It&#x27;s kind of heavy but it makes your skin smooth and natural. When applying this product on your face, it might be pale at first but it will oxidize to your skin color. Overall, not a bad product.</li>
            <li> This product is good for people with dry skin. I have normal to oily skin and this product just added to the oil on my skin. They sent a sample if the VIP gold balm and that worked better on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have repurchased this BB cream 3 different times. It is by far the best formula that I have found for people with very dry skin. I have a lot of problems with foundations and bb creams clinging to dry patches, or looking very obvious on my skin. This leaves a nice dewey finish and looks so natural. The only downside to this is the color, it is rather grey and darker than my NC 5-10 skin. But it&#x27;s still usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that this also looks good on a wide variety of skin tones, including people who are much darker than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must have for those who like bb creams, and especially those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream. I have medium light skin with yellow undertones and this product adjusts perfectly to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My technique: I pump out a pea size amount on the back of my hand and then place spots of the cream all over my face. I blend in with my fingertips and pat on extra in places I need more coverage. It starts out gray on your face but 10 minutes later it oxidizes to your skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It brightens my face and has a very natural look. It is a bit drying, so I suggest applying moisturizer first. Finish off with a little powder and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stays on all day in 80 degree, dry weather.</li>
            <li> This was my very first bb cream that I&#x27;ve purchased from skin79 and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m asian and have fairly tan skin that gets oily very easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very cute and the pump is easy to use. The bb cream has a gray undertone and looks gray when you apply it to the face. It says it&#x27;s supposed to oxidize and match your skin tone in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the color is very light for my skin, I tend to mix it with my moisturizer to sheer it out. I find that it&#x27;s also better to apply it with your fingers instead of a brush. After I use an oil-free pressed powder on top to give my face some color.&lt;br /&gt;As far as coverage goes, this can have low-medium coverage. I&#x27;ve tried building it up but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I can&#x27;t say it covers dark spots or hides acne very well, but it does hide the redness around my cheek/nose area (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this bb cream is how well it controls the excess oil on my face. On days that I don&#x27;t use this, my cheek and nose area gets very (I mean VERY) oily in about 4-5 hours. With this on my face I get very little oil the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I probably will be repurchasing this when I run out and I&#x27;m dying to try the other skin79 bb creams.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I bought this early April and have been using often until this review (July 5th). I can say that my large pores have gotten smaller and that my complexion is getting evened out. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND EDIT (September 30): I&#x27;ve tried putting the cream on as is without mixing it with my daily moisturizer, then setting it with powder. Oil control is better. My complexion is evened out for the most part and appears less dull than it did before. Still have plenty left in the container!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (March 2013): Haven&#x27;t been using it often since I purchased, but I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for the past 2 weeks. Washed my face, put on some moisturizer,a pea sized amount of bb cream all over my face, then powder. My pores have gotten sooo much smaller and my skin tone is very evened out now. Still loving it and not even halfway done with the bottle yet!bb cream all over my face, then powder. My pores have gotten sooo much smaller and my skin tone is very evened out now. Still loving it and not even halfway done with the bottle yet!</li>
            <li> I used this BB cream and like the texture, it also leaves a nice color, but it doesn&#x27;t keep my skin oil free which is the reason I bought this one.</li>
            <li> Consistency and coverage of product were awful... The product I received was clearly counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I have tried a  few other BB Creams but they do not look natural at all, it&#x27;s like my face is caked on with dry make up no matter what I do to accommodate it. This one is a lot smoother and natural looking. It does make me look a bit lighter than my natural skin tone but I can deal with that since it covers up my scars pretty well. It does not cover them up all the way though, despite what people say. I have tried to completely cover them with the product but then it starts to look caked on. This product also lasts for a long time. The pump stops working about a 1/3 in so you have to shake it around or take it apart (which isn&#x27;t too hard) and use something like a stick to take the product out. It also helps protect my face from the sun during the summer time and lessen the sweating on my face, which I greatly appreciate! I hate sweating and showing up somewhere with a red face (I live in about 108° weather). The things I don&#x27;t like about it is that it dries up my face so I have to make sure I keep up on using face moisturizer, especially before using it. Also my white heads become very noticeable with it so I have to take care of those the night before. It also makes the little hairs on my face more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I do expect more out of this product even though I said I liked it. But I&#x27;m really basing it off of what I have tried so far and I believe it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;m going to get right now, it&#x27;s generally cheap and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this BB cream!!  Like other reviews, initially when you apply it on your face, it does give you a grayish tint. But, once you wait a bit after application it will brighten your skin and match your skin tone.  Even my husband and my 7 year old daughter complimented my skin after my first application.  They both said the BB cream even out my skin tone and covered up my dark spots.  It is my first time trying this brand of BB cream, so I am REALLY SATISFIED with the results!  Definitely will reorder this again, once I run out.</li>
            <li> I love using this skin 79Super+BB and I use it instead of makeup. Goes on so smooth and I feel protected from the sun. It looks and last allday without a touchup.[[ASIN:B0020ZEA40 SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label ) SPF25 PA++ 40g]]</li>
            <li> I like this bb cream. It is a bit thick, so it covers everything. My only issue is that it has a slight grey tint after application. I think it wares off a bit, but I&#x27;m on search for a warmer finish. Sometimes I feel like I look sickly right after applying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to begin by saying that despite my own trouble with this particular product, I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I still think it&#x27;s great (just not for me!). Also, after cross checking it several times it does appear to be legitimate and not a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grey color didn&#x27;t last, it did self adjust to my pale skin tone. It looked lovely, however it felt very heavy and slick on my skin. Also, I broke out with cosmetic acne after using it. So I think for others it may be a dream product. However if your skin is like mine (oily and acne prone) you might want to skip this one. It claims to control sebum and help clear skin but it does neither.</li>
            <li> I got scared at first because it seemed gray and natural but in couple minutes voila great glowing skin that not oily or shiny. You can use it alone, under foundation or with powder mineral foundation. I used today and my skin looked great as it was no make up at all. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical that when I&#x27;d finally receive the bb cream it would be a fake. But after looking for all signs of fraud I was relieved that it was real.&lt;br /&gt;It feels thick when you first pump it out but it blends crazy smooth, I&#x27;m so glad I tried it. I have acne prone, scarred skin and it smoothed out my whole complexion. It doesn&#x27;t cover everything but you could easily layer it. Plus it&#x27;s packaging is so convenient to use. I ordered mine from pink gelee, and  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order from anyone else from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this several times on Amazon, it&#x27;s a little more than I&#x27;d like to spend, but I love the product and it lasts at least a couple months. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and this product matches near perfectly. It&#x27;s also thicker than some other BB creams, so it covers nicely I don&#x27;t use any foundation or concealer. I only stopped ordering it since I found Pond&#x27;s BB cream is around 10 dollars, but it is thinner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. This was the new bottle and I think they made the product a bit lighter than the original. It makes me so much whiter than the old bottle I had. I don&#x27;t know how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth buying. It feels fake and really dry on skin. It also caused allergic reaction and irration on my skin. I just started using one of the three I bought and it does not help my skin but it actually did the opposite of what I thought it would. This is one of the worst products I have bought and it has no smell like the ones I or previously use which was really affective and good feeling. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is considering.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this.. I love the way it feels.  I&#x27;m Asian more in the ivory side and it does blend on my skin nicely if your darker complexion I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it does go on the whiter side.</li>
            <li> Love this! Covers just enough but not full coverage so your face can breathe during the day.  If you never used BB products don&#x27;t worry when you first apply and notice that it&#x27;s really a light shade, after 10-15 minutes the color matches your skin.  I sometimes pair this product with a powder before or after to give different finishing effects.</li>
            <li> My go to bb cream! Medium coverage with a great spf. I use this bb cream for my every day make up routine and haven&#x27;t found anything better. Most likely looks best with lighter skin complexions. I am naturally pretty pale with blue undertones. If I use this bb cream after I have &amp;#34;tanned&amp;#34; (I use the st. Tropez tanner during the summer) i sometimes get that &amp;#34;grayish&amp;#34; hue to the bb cream, but that is only if I am a darker tan. I have used this bb cream for over two years and I think it has done a lot for my overall complexion compared to applying foundation every day. Caution with buying from random sellers with questionable ratings, there are a lot of fakes out there</li>
            <li> I would give it a four and half but there are only five stars and four stars so I give it a four, I have light skin and I still need to use powder or a little conclear to make it blend with my skin tone which is normal I am very light skinned. It&#x27;s smooth to put on but be ware of too much a little goes a long way and you will need some cotton balls to even out the make up near the chin and eyes. It is an awesome product and very easy to apply the one accessory that is shows in the picture never arrived with is though it&#x27;s just the by cream. So just Oder knowing the you only get the bb cream.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup. Easy to thin with a lil moisturizer in the summer.  Never looks &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; even in the winter. Keeps breakouts to a minimum. Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. It greatly improves my 65 year old fair skin; not only immediately, but 8 hours later and even after washing, the next day! My skin is normally blotchy red, huge pores, many wrinkles and flakey. I also have age spots and marks from removal of pre-cancerous spots.&lt;br /&gt;I gave only 3 stars because I read the following three articles warning that skin brightening products might contain lead, arsenic and mercury: 1. http://safecosmetics.org/article.php?id&#x3D;672&lt;br /&gt;2, http://www.collective-evolution.com/2012/04/10/you-have-the-right-to-know-17-chemicals-to-avoid-in-cosmetic-and-personal-care-products/&lt;br /&gt;3. http://phpa.dhmh.maryland.gov/SitePages/facecream.aspx. Quote from this source: \\&quot;If the label does not list the ingredients, stop using it. Federal law requires that the ingredients be listed on the label.\\&quot; I tried Maybelline BB cream, there&#x27;s no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/9/14 Update - I just got a new box of BB Cream. The box now lists ingredients. Ordered through Amazon, from k-beauty, I got it in two days!</li>
            <li> Made my skin burn and texture was weird, it did go on grey and come out my skin color but it made me break out severely. To mention again, it caused irritation and a bit of burning, but my skin is sensitive to Vitamin C. I&#x27;m sure this product would work better for somebody with not sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really nice product and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It comes on grey but within minutes, it oxides to match a wide range of skin tones between light to medium. I have a summer tan and it works well in evening out my skin tone. My mom used some and she has a pale complexion, but it also works for her face too. A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too much! Otherwise, your face gets shiny and has a greasy feeling to it.</li>
            <li> Was the real product. NOT a knockoff</li>
            <li> I thought Estée Lauder&#x27;s DayWear BB cream was some good stuff until I tried this one! I know that a lot of people love EL&#x27;s but man, this one puts theirs to shame.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s perfect for when I want to go light on the makeup, especially during the summer months.  It goes on smooth, lasts, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily!  It looks great too!  A little goes a long way, so this will last a while.  It works perfectly on my sometimes oily skin.  It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> Hello Amazoners!&lt;br /&gt;I researched and researched before buying Skin79 Super+ BB Triple Function Hot Pink BB Cream. I looked at a lot of BB Creams and looked up tons of reviews. Who wants to purchase something that&#x27;s not right for them? So I narrowed down my search and finally decided to buy from SeoulGlamour (they sell the real deal, BTW).&lt;br /&gt;The Triple Function Hot Pink BB Cream is what I decided to buy because it seemed most compatible with my skin. I have rather oily skin with a few blemishes. I usually wear ivory to classic ivory make-up because I&#x27;m pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: This stuff is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Packaging - attractive, the pump is easy to use and hygenic&lt;br /&gt;Consistancy - thick, feels like SPF moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Application - goes on like SPF and feels really oily&lt;br /&gt;Color - I&#x27;ll admit my first impression was horror 0.0. It looks gray and weird at first. The directions say to pat your skin after applying, I think this helps it to oxidize. After the intial shock, I was amazed with how it looked like I had nothing on at all! It completely transformed to match my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Coverage - light to medium. This product will not cover everything; like dark red scars and under eye circles. It will however make them less noticeable. The product can be layered to cover better but I suggest a light concealer until your dark spots lighten a little.&lt;br /&gt;Finish - the thick SPF feel worried me at first (after all I have oily skin) so I was skeptical and thought I might breakout from using this BB cream. Surprisingly it gave me a dewy, natural skin look that wasn&#x27;t at all oily. Smooth to the touch without being too dry or too wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a week now and my skin has made improvements. The dark spots that I couldn&#x27;t cover at first with just the BB cream are now manageble with just the cream alone. My skin is smoother and I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant breakouts. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and plan to continue my use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, SeoulGlamour was prompt and curteous with the shipment. My order came with two samples (I look forward to trying them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an update: I came back after a few months of use to let you all know my skin looks better and feels better. The more I use the product the less I need ^_^. I&#x27;ve also stopped using conventional moisturizers at night, instead I just use Extra virgin olive oil. This combination of skin care has helped my skin clear up, my complexion even out, and my confidence soar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jess</li>
            <li> ok so I was sceptical about well everything.. wil it be real or a fake? is it really that low? well yes! recieved mine today and absolutely love it because I already tried it. Shipping was fast and the cute thank you note and samples were also cute. It is real! and will be buying from this seller again soon :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a foundation person, so I decided to try BB cream. This cream is on the light side, but after a few moments, it darkens up to get closer to my skin colour. It&#x27;s still a little light for me, so I mix with a little normal foundation and it works well. The coverage is light and needs some extra concealer over more trouble areas. I can wear this formula most of the work day.&lt;br /&gt;Not good for pictures as the SPF makes you turn white. I&#x27;d love this BB cream more if it matched my skin better.</li>
            <li> I bought the Pink BB cream from Pink Gelee and after much research, I can verify that it is truly the authentic product. I was a bit scared that it wouldn&#x27;t be at first, but it truly seems real. I tried it on a bit last night and the color seemed a bit too light at first, but it slowly but surely got a little darker. I&#x27;m new to the bb cream craze and had actually tried the Maybelline BB Cream from the USA, but I noticed my skin getting oily/shiny within an hour of using the Maybelline bb cream even with setting powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received my shipment of skin79 pink bb cream and had to try it out the same night. Skin79&#x27;s product is definitely thicker and less watery on application, but it was indeed lighter than the Maybelline&#x27;s \\&quot;Light Sheer tint\\&quot;. I&#x27;d say that Maybelline&#x27;s bb cream matched my skin better in color, but Skin79&#x27;s product was much better in keeping my oily skin under control. I didn&#x27;t get shiny in the 5 hours that I used Skin79&#x27;s bb cream and I didn&#x27;t even have to apply setting powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4/5 stars since it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone as greatly as I&#x27;d hoped, even though I&#x27;m fairly pale in color. Also, I noticed that if I don&#x27;t moisturize or exfoliate first, that the dry skin around my nose becomes obvious when using this bb cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I prefer this over the Maybelline Dream Fresh bb cream, but we&#x27;ll see how it goes when I try on the product in the daytime. Hopefully I&#x27;ll remember to update this later down the road to see if Skin79&#x27;s bb cream actually smoothes out the freckles and dark spots I have on my skin as touted by their advertisements ^_^</li>
            <li> My sister in law came to visit recently and had a rash on her face from sun exposure. Everything she tried was irritating it. The second morning I gave her this BB cream to see if it would help.  Even after using it everyday I was blown away how great her face looked after applying it, she even ended up talking me out of my bottle!  This is my replacement bottle!  In between I tried a couple of samples of other BB creams, and was immediately disappointed after experiencing the moisture and coverage of this one.  Won&#x27;t be showing this bottle to anyone but me!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great match to my skin! I ran out of the BB cream and had to buy a new foundation from the store while awaiting for my BB cream to get here in the mail.  The new foundation from the store does not compare and I was frustrated as it took my about 15 minutes to fix my face where the BB cream only takes me like 2 minutes, then add mascara and I&#x27;m finished! I will keep buying this product!</li>
            <li> This product shipped and arrived VERY fast... Received within just a few days (maybe 3 total)... It is very thick so use sparingly and under foundation it fills in pores, lines and wrinkles to leave your skin looking flawless. It does have a dewy finish which having somewhat oily skin I don&#x27;t really like but it isn&#x27;t too bad. I didn&#x27;t get super oily until maybe 8 to 10 hrs later. Overall I like this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample and wow, was I impressed. I buy the Diamond Prestige BB crème by Skin 79 and love that product. This one seems to provide a bit better coverage and it feels and looks fantastic. It&#x27;s a bit pricier but seems like I will use less so I am giving it a try. Will work for a variety of skin tones. I have fair skin and it blends beautifully. My daughter has darker skin tone and works great for her as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on May 5th, and although it was estimated to be delivered to my home between May 31st and June 22nd, I received it just yesterday on the 15th! It was pretty well packaged and came with the promised sample and a sample of a skinfood product. I also know that this is not a fake product that you hear about all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t resist and tried the product, hoping that it would oxidize to match my medium-light complexion and was very glad when it did. The coverage isn&#x27;t very heavy -- something I was expecting and counting on -- and gave a natural finish that evened out my skin tone. I was also concerned that it would leave me shiny after a few hours since I have combination/oily skin. It passed that test pretty well, though I&#x27;d still have to test it and see how that will go when wearing it during the Summer&#x27;s heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly enough, when I later washed it off before going to bed, I&#x27;d noticed that my face felt smoother and softer than it had before I put the product on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied with the product and the fast shipping. I&#x27;m now looking forward to finding out if all the claims made by makers of these BB creams are true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it a few times, I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t quite match my complexion when it oxidizes. It also saddens me to say that I&#x27;ve had a reaction to it, specifically around my eyes. So I&#x27;m not too sure if I&#x27;ll be able to continue using this product. It really would be a shame as I&#x27;ve enjoyed the smoothing and softening affect it&#x27;s had on my face.</li>
            <li> Gives me my desired kpop look. Covers all my acne. Only problem is you have to blend it in well or people will criticize for how pale your face it.</li>
            <li> Better than foundation.  Evens out the redness and moisturizes.  Looks really smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, and I really do like it. I put some of my Avon Anew makeup on my finger and then mix this SKIN 79 BB cream into that. It looks so good! It makes my face very smooth. I think it is just that lightening and brightening that is so popular with the true BB creams that makes this product work so well for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this instead of traditional foundation and it works great. I get a better skin match and hide slight imperfections. I even have my mother using it now.</li>
            <li> This BB cream provides complete coverage of all skin imperfections!  It is not drying your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking orange.  I like the pump design which leaves no mess.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This works well with my skin. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out and feels light on my face. The price could be less other than that I was happy.</li>
            <li> It was the origional product and not a fake from inspection, also it was really good on my skin. However, my aunt used it and she has really dry skin so she had to apply some moisturizer before hand. that being said she still really like what the product did for her face. I will definitely order form this seller again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, Make sure you have the real one lots of fakes out there. When it arrived I covered some on half of my face at first it felt little greasy but that will change after awhile you can really see the differences. Geat coverage by itself when your in a hurry. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream! It is smooth, doesn&#x27;t make me break out like everything else. It is a gloss BB cream, not matte, but with powder it looks great...or alone it looks amazing as well. One step, easy and stays on all day. After using it for a while now my skin looks better than ever. It does fade dark spots but not completely and it takes a long time to notice. I will be buying this from now on instead of make up. It&#x27;s amazing! This is authentic Skin79 BB cream, not the fake stuff. It ships from Korea and it is relatively fast shipping considering. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! bought one for my mom as well. I have oily skin and a history of bad acne, so I typically hate putting skin products on my face since they tend to clog your pores throughout the day (creams, lotions, sunscreen, foundation, etc). I love that this takes care of a bunch of &amp;#34;necessary&amp;#34; skin steps in one step. unfortunately, the last one I bought for myself, the pump stopped working after a few uses...</li>
            <li> I had seen an article in an old magazine and figured I&#x27;d try this I went to the web found some you tube videos, read reviews and picked this one.  I like this one.  It&#x27;s like clinique&#x27;s city sunblock w more coverage the color isnt as great but it does transition from gray to blend with your skin.  If your completion is darker I can say if this will work.  But it&#x27;s a good sin screen.  It didn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.This product has done wonders for me.It has cleared my acne.Because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pore like regular make up.And I have very dark under eye skin tone due sinus problems and iron deficiency.And it hides the dark skin and makes my eyes look normal and not look tired.I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I tried it once and I have been hooked ever since. When I ran out I tried a cheaper generic brand and it didn&#x27;t even hold a candle to this stuff.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is amazing. I have the Loreal kind &amp; maybelline but this stuff is about 100000 times better!  And for the price it was amazing. Pink Gelee sells authentic skin79 because I checked and made sure, and I will definitely be ordering from this seller again. Plus two free samples and a thank you note!</li>
            <li> I love this BB crram so much! I have mild acne that this covers really well without looking cakey or causing irritation. I have very dry skin so I have to put a lot of lotion on underneath. I find that misting my face with water before I put it on helps. I have fair skin with yellow undertones so this works well on my skin. I used to use the Loreal Youth Code BB, but it was too dark. I love that this has 25 SPF.&lt;br /&gt;I feel so pretty wearing this BB cream. My skin looks flawless and anything I need to cover I just use the Almay smart shade concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Fantastic BB cream. The color is just right for my skin tone, it has great SPF and light-weight enough to wear under foundation or just wear alone</li>
            <li> This product is great! I tried the classic balm and the pink skin79 BB cream. Both of them are awesome and I will be buying both again. The pink one I leave at home for when i do my makeup before i go out. It is a good size, larger than just a tube of BB cream, and you only need to use half of a dime size in order to cover your face. It leaves such a flawless finish. I know that some people have said that the pink one is a little whiter in color than the classic balm, this is true, but both blend in wonderfully so there really is no difference. I do have a ligh skin complexion so i think thats why it still looked good on me. The pink balm is also a little thicker than the classic balm and will give you a more even airbrushed finish that you would probably like better for a night out. I say get both, ordering two of these balms costs way less than one BB cream at sephora.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It covers and blends beautifully.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a friend who also likes it.  We have totally different skin tones and I don&#x27;t know how it manages to blend well with both.  We&#x27;re both seniors and have sun marks too.  I think I&#x27;m going to try it on my legs for summer too because it doesn&#x27;t seem to transfer at all.  I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, makes my skin feel soft and healthy.. I&#x27;m definately buying more .. It gives you clear looking skiing and last all day</li>
            <li> I am very much a beauty product guru and am always on the look out for the greatest and best products. I am 30 years old, with combo skin, very fair and am hypervigilant about taking care of my skin due to years and years of battling the trauma of horrendous acne (which has subdued since I had my baby, thankfully!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is just amazing. The coverage is wonderful, and blends beautifully into my skin. I love the way it feels on my skin and the benefits of SPF and overall skin conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product. If the color is a little off, try the gold or some of the other options you can get, but I swear by this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, and the price is right. All around, just a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and this bb cream blends in well. I knew it would start out a yucky grey like molding clay, but I was also worried about the brownish undertones. When it was done blending, it suited my colour very well! I have used skin79 oriental gold and it is very nice too but leaves my skin dry. When this is done oxidizing, it looks very fair and pretty. It got to me a day after the latest  arrival date, but that&#x27;s ok. Thank you~</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product! I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to foundation. It&#x27;s light weight and flawless, I feel like my skin can breathe. I just ordered another for my sister because she noticed a difference as well. Fast shipping great service!</li>
            <li> I got mine yesterday so it came faster than I thought (11 days). I checked if it was real or not by look at the authentic label, perforated line, top, expiration date, etc and so far I think it is real. HOWEVER, in the images, whether real or fake, says &#x27;WRINKLE FREE&#x27; after SPF 25 PA++. For mine, it says &#x27;WRINKLE IMPROVEMENT&#x27;. Since this was made on July 9, 2012 (pretty recent), I was wondering if this is a new change the real Skin79 made...or if this can be fake. Everything else is authentic, I&#x27;m just not sure about the change of word...can anyone who recently bought the bb cream from a month or two ago see if it says &#x27;wrinkle improvement&#x27; too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After looking at it again, I could scratch off the silver-rainbow &#x27;BB&#x27; on the bottle if I attack a small spot with my nails. Also, I noticed that the authentic label says &#x27;VOID&#x27; very faintly under the words.I&#x27;m very worried that this might be a fake...won&#x27;t use it until I get some answers/ research.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.i wont be using foundation anymore.i only didnt like the color.it doesnt match with my skin color.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of discoloration due to sun spots but other than that don&#x27;t need much cover. This works amazingly for me and my needs! Makes my skin look a tone whiter and not at all dry, like I&#x27;m not wearing any product! Very healthy and natural looking skin. I&#x27;m 38 and Mediterranean.&lt;br /&gt;It also arrived fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li> This is a good product!!</li>
            <li> Like it almost as much as my clinque foundation</li>
            <li> I really Love this cream..I have 64 year old skin and it made my face look flawless! Bright, and moist.</li>
            <li> Awesome product,  Will order it again as it is much more natural than foundations. I use a foundation brush and my skin looks great.  Highly recommend.  I&#x27;m sharing this new product info with everyone i know.  It goes on very smooth and silky and after oxidation matches my skin tone beautifully. Very natural, skin feels great.</li>
            <li> My daughter turned me on to this product.  She gave me the samples that came with her order and I have since passed those on to someone else.  I purchased the Pink BB cream first, but after reading the reviews I also ordered the Gold one.  They work slightly different depending on the humidity.  There is a great skin chart on the SKIN79 page[[ASIN:B0020Z31S6 SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream VIP Gold Collection (Gold Label) 1.33oz/40g]]</li>
            <li> love this product use everyday!</li>
            <li> Very light, with good coverage, and has been my favorite foundation I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m definitely a convert, and I keep showing my family and friends it and then they are converts too.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this with the fact that I am a very pale, highly sensitive ginger girl. I get hives from everything... or it makes me break out into horrible acne. This product did not only work great but didn&#x27;t give me skin irritation or acne. Actually, it helped improve my acne problems and removed my old red acne marks and evened out my skin tone. The texture is thick and creamy enough that it doesn&#x27;t run and goes on smooth. You do have to pat it on to make it blend into your skin tone. Its pretty neat the way it blends to you skin, it takes it a minute or two though and matches pretty well to my fair Irish skin tone.  I have used American drugstore brand BB creams afterward (when they all came out) and been very disappointed. The Maybelline stuff smells strongly of perfume, thin and runny, doesn&#x27;t help my red marks, and makes me break out even worse, and don&#x27;t even get me started on the other drugstore brands. I haven&#x27;t tried the Clinque stuff but for the price?....I&#x27;m definitely going back to this product.</li>
            <li> I will only use this bb cream in the future, It is light weight and looks natural on my face.</li>
            <li> This is my second Pink BB cream, it is very good and i use it everyday :) Also it helps even up my skin tone so that was a plus ;)</li>
