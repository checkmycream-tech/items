    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Came with 6 pcs as mentioned, two of them did not close perfectly and needed some adjustment with my pliers, but after that worked flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>Great Value!</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I picked them up.</li>
            <li>Great set.</li>
            <li>These are great for alot of things.i am always using them for everything.great for the money.i would buy them again.</li>
            <li>These anti static tweezers are perfect.  </li>
            <li>But Quality is Good</li>
            <li>when I started using them , they felt good and well made .</li>
            <li>This is the best example to illustrate a cheap versus an inexpensive item.</li>
            <li>I recommend that if a consumer is looking for a good quality tweezer-set, consider price.</li>
            <li>nice set of tweezers , very nice ends and well balanced .</li>
            <li>He was very pleased with this set.</li>
            <li>Nice set of tools to add to my collection.</li>
            <li>These work great and give you the right tools for the job.</li>
            <li>He loves that they are anti-static, which is very important in what he uses them for.</li>
            <li>Very cheap tweezers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they fulfil a need.</li>
            <li>Quality was okay for this item, it does what it needs to</li>
            <li>Use this more on watches than cell phones.</li>
            <li>I make steampunk jewelry, which means I use a lot of tiny watch parts (gears, hands) in my work, and these tweezers handle those  things perfectly.</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I used them for repair of several electrical components, and are very good for the price.</li>
            <li>Good product, service &amp; fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I took them out and put them in my toolbox and have been working fine ever since.  </li>
            <li>But I can handle it just fine.</li>
            <li>Tips not ground as accurately as some.</li>
            <li>Read all the one-star reviews; they are accurate.</li>
            <li>A great set for the price though, especially for electronics beginners looking to build up a tool kit.</li>
            <li>These are really cheap tweezers, in every sense of the word; price and quality.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the price was cheap which should have been an indication to me.</li>
            <li>The best feature about these tweezers is the picture posted on this Amazon advertisement, because at least they look acceptable in the picture.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are only good for the lightest clamping pressure.</li>
            <li>For the price paid, product quality is OK... if you will only use tweezers in very gentle applications these are probably suitable.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight and strong.</li>
            <li>I can make better than these.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, soft metal.</li>
            <li>and they are just right for the job.</li>
            <li>They work well and are priced right.</li>
            <li>The tips are not ground perfect and are a little rough, but for the price they work just fine.</li>
            <li>well all, thank you very much</li>
            <li>they are nice, very small and useful for people that need precise tweezers</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s precise and great for any kind of beading or other small work.</li>
            <li>little buffing could have made these more comfortable  around the edges...</li>
            <li>At this price they are certainly expendable.</li>
            <li>A little bag to put them would have been nice.</li>
            <li>I received the package and it came straight from china with all the stamps and their language written on the package  ,, that was kinda neat , so</li>
            <li>and feel like they came straight from stamping press.  </li>
            <li>They must have meant lowest quality tweezers available in the entire world.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for small screws and to use for soldering wires in tight places.</li>
            <li>But, look elsewhere for medium to high grade tweezers.</li>
            <li>I will find other uses now that I have these quality tools available.</li>
            <li>come in a cheap Chinese paper package, individually wrapped.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;stainless&amp;#34; metal use to make these tweezers is very soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>When you pay this little for a set of six tweezers, you don&#x27;t expect to receive six finely machined, highly polished, well-crafted, expensive-looking tweezers.  </li>
            <li>; That is a complete lie.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them to &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; at the tips because applying any real force causes the entire length of the tweezer to shut, so</li>
            <li>THIS SET AT SUCH A CHEAP PRICE WILL LAST ME A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li>Perfect for model assembly or small parts which are difficult to pick up by hand.  </li>
            <li>This is a cheap, poorly manufactured item very representative of what has become an icon of our time: &amp;#34;chinese junk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>He is a big Raspberry Pi person and build many things using the very small computer components that are Raspberry Pi.</li>
            <li>you are fairly limited in how much force actually makes it to the tips.</li>
            <li>Be warned, they take a very long time to get here (nearly 3 months).</li>
            <li>These are very useful for handling small screws and other tiny things.  </li>
            <li>great set for working with small parts and hard to reach spots can&#x27;t beat them when you need them a must have if your in to small hobbies</li>

            <li> If you need something solid and heavy duty</li>
            <li> This kit is pretty much useless.</li>

            <li> ALL MY OLD TWEEZERS WERE TWISTED OR RUSTY.</li>
            <li> If you want the cheapest, lowest quality and almost worthless set of tweezers available on the internet, then buy these tweezers.</li>
            <li> Too thick to hold, not good quality</li>
            <li> Not super durable, but wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the metal used to make them is somewhat thin</li>
            <li> Laptop PC have some very small items in the 1 to 3 mm range that are difficult to handle.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this set.  </li>

            <li> This are the worst tweezers I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can find a set worst than this one.</li>
            <li> These are the worst tweezers you can buy!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible quality</li>

            <li> You get what you pay for, These are a bit floppy bendable...Not to sturdy. Does the trick though!</li>
            <li> Too thick to hold, not good quality</li>
            <li> Good product, service &amp; fast delivery.  Tips not ground as accurately as some. Great price.</li>
            <li> Bad quality, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> well all, thank you very much</li>
            <li> Came from China, took too long. But Quality is Good</li>
            <li> Came with 6 pcs as mentioned, two of them did not close perfectly and needed some adjustment with my pliers, but after that worked flawlessly.  They are antielectric and don&#x27;t conduct heat well so you can use them in soldering without any fear of burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in a cheap Chinese paper package, individually wrapped.  I took them out and put them in my toolbox and have been working fine ever since.  I used them for repair of several electrical components, and are very good for the price.</li>
            <li> I received the package and it came straight from china with all the stamps and their language written on the package  ,, that was kinda neat , so when I started using them , they felt good and well made . nice set of tweezers , very nice ends and well balanced . I like the Sharpe points</li>
            <li> As advertised, sturdy and functional.  Definitely not premium tools, contain minor defects both cosmetic and structural.  A great set for the price though, especially for electronics beginners looking to build up a tool kit.</li>
            <li> great set for working with small parts and hard to reach spots can&#x27;t beat them when you need them a must have if your in to small hobbies</li>
            <li> These are perfect for small screws and to use for soldering wires in tight places.</li>
            <li> Perfect for model assembly or small parts which are difficult to pick up by hand.  Every possible bend is included.</li>
            <li> These are really cheap tweezers, in every sense of the word; price and quality. The steel is soft and the finish is rough. I&#x27;m sure they fulfil a need. At this price they are certainly expendable. But, look elsewhere for medium to high grade tweezers.</li>
            <li> ALL MY OLD TWEEZERS WERE TWISTED OR RUSTY. THIS SET AT SUCH A CHEAP PRICE WILL LAST ME A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> This are the worst tweezers I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;Look and feel like they came straight from stamping press.  Rough edges are not deburred.&lt;br /&gt;Tips do not quite match.  Visible machining marks (grinding) after cleaning spot welds.&lt;br /&gt;It should carry a warning sign:  Total junk!  Recycle intermediately!&lt;br /&gt;I guess, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the price. They come from over seas and I was shocked on how quickly they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m into watch repair and they are just right for the job. There are more expensive sets out there, but these work fine.&lt;br /&gt;A little buffing could have made these more comfortable  around the edges...But I can handle it just fine. They work. I&#x27;m happy I picked them up.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this set.  The tips are not ground perfect and are a little rough, but for the price they work just fine.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these. He is a big Raspberry Pi person and build many things using the very small computer components that are Raspberry Pi. He was very pleased with this set. He loves that they are anti-static, which is very important in what he uses them for. I didn&#x27;t realize they were coming from China. Be warned, they take a very long time to get here (nearly 3 months).</li>
            <li> These are a little on the flimsy side.  If you need something solid and heavy duty then this product is not for you..</li>
            <li> they are nice, very small and useful for people that need precise tweezers solid built and very small tweezers word</li>
            <li> Quality was okay for this item, it does what it needs to so no complains for the price i got it for.</li>
            <li> If you want the cheapest, lowest quality and almost worthless set of tweezers available on the internet, then buy these tweezers. I don&#x27;t think you can find a set worst than this one. Read all the one-star reviews; they are accurate. The best feature about these tweezers is the picture posted on this Amazon advertisement, because at least they look acceptable in the picture. At least the stick-on labels are straight. I ordered my set on June 7 and they were delivered July 5. The &amp;#34;stainless&amp;#34; metal use to make these tweezers is very soft and pliable. These tweezers are only good for the lightest clamping pressure. If you press with any force, the metal bends. The product description calls them &amp;#34;high quality.&amp;#34; That is a complete lie. They must have meant lowest quality tweezers available in the entire world.</li>
            <li> Nice set of tools to add to my collection. Use this more on watches than cell phones. They work well and are priced right.</li>
            <li> For the price paid, product quality is OK... if you will only use tweezers in very gentle applications these are probably suitable.  Otherwise, the metal used to make them is somewhat thin and so they are in my opinion overly flexible and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them to &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; at the tips because applying any real force causes the entire length of the tweezer to shut, so you are fairly limited in how much force actually makes it to the tips.</li>
            <li> This is the best example to illustrate a cheap versus an inexpensive item. This is a cheap, poorly manufactured item very representative of what has become an icon of our time: &amp;#34;chinese junk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These are the worst tweezers you can buy!!! I can make better than these.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, soft metal. Practically useless. Not enough spring&lt;br /&gt;strength to pick even the lightest items.</li>
            <li> This kit is pretty much useless. Fortunately the price was cheap which should have been an indication to me. Specifically the tweezer are made of cheap metal and the points do not close together, so plucking small hairs or picking up small parts is not possible.  I recommend that if a consumer is looking for a good quality tweezer-set, consider price. I should have.</li>
            <li> Very cheap tweezers. The edge of the tweezers are not polished, therefore they might cut your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the job for the cost</li>
            <li> These are very useful for handling small screws and other tiny things.  Laptop PC have some very small items in the 1 to 3 mm range that are difficult to handle.  These anti static tweezers are perfect.  I will find other uses now that I have these quality tools available.</li>
            <li> I make steampunk jewelry, which means I use a lot of tiny watch parts (gears, hands) in my work, and these tweezers handle those  things perfectly. Very lightweight and strong. Great set.</li>
            <li> Not super durable, but wasn&#x27;t expensive so I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> These are great for alot of things.i am always using them for everything.great for the money.i would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these they are useless. Terrible quality</li>
            <li> I bought these for coil building for my RDAs and rewicking Pro Tank II and Nautilus coils. These work great and give you the right tools for the job.</li>
            <li> When you pay this little for a set of six tweezers, you don&#x27;t expect to receive six finely machined, highly polished, well-crafted, expensive-looking tweezers.  And you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The ends come very sharp and I sanded them down a bit before using. Overall it&#x27;s precise and great for any kind of beading or other small work. I use it to get out unwanted hairs from my felt.</li>
            <li> Does what they are supposed to do. A little bag to put them would have been nice.</li>
            <li> Great Value! The only down side to me was that this was an imported item so it takes a while to get and then the Postal Carrier would not leave in my mailbox because it required a signature. So I had to wait for a day off to go to the Post Office to pick it up.</li>
