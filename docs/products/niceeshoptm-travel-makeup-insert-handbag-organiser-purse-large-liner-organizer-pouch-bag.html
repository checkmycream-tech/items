            <li>I ordered one because i wanted to check the quality before ordering more.  </li>

            <li>The top zipper makes it work well in my briefcase-bag.</li>
            <li>Ordering more to give for christmas.</li>
            <li>I was able to put all my stuff in all of the pockets</li>
            <li>and I still have room for more.  </li>
            <li>and it happened with more than one purse, was that once I had everything in the organizer, the purse now felt heavier.  </li>
            <li>There are many pockets and segments where you can store your eye pencils, lipsticks, blushes, etcetera.</li>
            <li>Well made and cheap!</li>

            <li>I would have ordered more than one</li>
            <li>though  it took a while to arrive it is nice to fit into diff purses tho</li>

            <li>I love it, my items are organized and it WS an affordable buy.</li>
            <li>ot any more.</li>
            <li>This product, especially off the price was perfect!!!</li>
            <li>It has snaps on the side so it can be more compact if you need it to be.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my daughter for her birthday, she likes to change her purses very often, so I think this will be a great idea for her.</li>
            <li>This works great in my purse and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Many have asked where I got it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it -</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>The product is of good quality and exactly as you see it in the picture.  </li>
            <li>It was a fair price and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I was truly able to fit EVERYTHING from my purse into this organizer.  </li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;ll fit we&#x27;ll into most of my bags.</li>
            <li>This light weight organizer is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I lubricated them with silicone to make them work more smoothly</li>
            <li>i was really surprised at what a great product this was.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s still a very functional organizer and definitely good value for the money.</li>
            <li>This product is very well made, and the material is really good.  </li>
            <li>This helps me keep everything organized neatly, plus makes it easy to transfer the contents whenever I switch bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is easy to move from one bag to another</li>
            <li>These make organizing so much easy.  </li>
            <li>It makes changing purses so easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>Lots of easy to see and use pockets.  </li>
            <li>Easy to remove from your purse and get it all without things falling out.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I can find things easily in my purse and no more&lt;br /&gt;digging</li>
            <li>Perfect organized for those big Hobo type bags that I love so much.</li>
            <li>If I were to by again I would buy it in a longer length because the width is fine</li>
            <li>It worked fine as a gift.</li>
            <li>This product was made with cheap fabric and cheap zippers that tear or get stuck easily.</li>
            <li>I was expecting an insert that would reflect the cheap price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great concept.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand people who write reviews and state that the product is cheap.  </li>
            <li>What I liked best was the deep pockets, yet not so deep that things get lost.</li>
            <li>i love it now when i need something i can go right to it</li>
            <li>This is a very useful product</li>

            <li>I recomiend this specially for frecuent travelers.</li>
            <li>there are plenty of pockets of various sizes for organization, which is good.</li>
            <li>MUCH better made than the Purseket &amp;reg; and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>As much as I love how much it holds, having to dig for items is a pain.  </li>
            <li>Great product and quality, works well for large open purses.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly into the bottom of my Bath &amp; Body Works tote, giving the limp bag some much needed structure.</li>
            <li>and I can easily transfer all my stuff to a different purse w/o any effort :)</li>
            <li>had I known it was this great for so little money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT WORTH THE WAIT.</li>
            <li>I am keeping it because it will be useful for my carry on travel bag.</li>
            <li>This item was worth its value.  </li>

            <li>I used the first one as a bag/purse insert</li>
            <li>If you have too many items, find something bigger.</li>
            <li>I ordered the organizer and it&#x27;s exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Could be better, but for the price, it&#x27;s a very solidly made piece.</li>

            <li>They were a HIT and were not expensive.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have given several away to friends and relatives and they all love it.  </li>
            <li>This is well made, very durable, many different sized pockets.</li>
            <li>I only got this today got all my stuff in and Love this so much</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how quickly this item arrived from Hong Kong (15 days).</li>
            <li>I only wish they make more variety to fit different.</li>
            <li>Pocket-wise, it&#x27;s very decent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; or find my way around the organizer, even though it sits at the bottom of a rather deep purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to pick up and change bags without extra time and fuss.</li>
            <li>I WILL CERTAINLY GET ANOTHER ONE.</li>
            <li>I purchased a purse that was just one large pocket.  </li>
            <li>There is a pocket or place for everything I carry in my large leather purse.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Pouch bag for my large purse</li>
            <li>cell phone etc so much easier.  </li>
            <li>This was really helpful.</li>
            <li>The idea behind it is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very versitile and holds alot.</li>
            <li>but that is because it holds so much.</li>
            <li>So much easier to find my stuff.</li>
            <li>In the case of this, the handles ripped off the first time I tried to transfer it to a new bag.</li>
            <li>well and exactly what I needed for a new no comparment bag</li>
            <li>I mostly carry smaller designer bags and this insert is all nylon/mesh and is pretty big.</li>
            <li>I personally will be using this on my wedding day (as my colors are gray and yellow), but it&#x27;ll be great to continue to use long after the wedding!</li>
            <li>I like all of the pockets to keep all of my loose items nice &amp; organized in my big purse.</li>
            <li>The rest of it still is intact, which is why I would still recommend it to someone who isn&#x27;t particularly attached to the idea of the handles staying...</li>
            <li>I use it to do quick change between different handbags.</li>
            <li>I can switch purses quickly and keep all my stuff in the same location.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It seems to be very well made - even stitching with no raw edges, sturdy fabric.</li>
            <li>The sides and bottom are not stiff, so it really couldn&#x27;t hold up in a floppy purse.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Product came early &amp; is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering a few more as gifts.</li>
            <li>It did not hold up with normal use.</li>
            <li>The pouch looks quite good, and has 3 large compartments and a lot of small compartments, useful for storing small items.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has so many compartments for all those small things (pens,hair clip,lip gloss) which normally just be scattered all over my purse,</li>
            <li>okay, smaller that expected</li>
            <li>Since this organizer only arrived yesterday, I can only suppose how much I&#x27;ll enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>arrived early!  </li>
            <li>No more leaving important items in the purse I&#x27;m not carrying!</li>
            <li>First, it arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>There is no support in the large middle area (bottom).</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived.</li>
            <li>I only wish I&#x27;d bought it much sooner.</li>
            <li>Very compact (tiny compartments).  </li>
            <li>Wow a place for everything and everything in its place.</li>
            <li>Free Shipping with an estimated ship date of a few days.</li>
            <li>This product would be great for a diaper bag or a bigger casual bag.</li>
            <li>The organizer handle ribbed open on the 2nd day and 3weeks later the zipper broke and it was not even full of things.</li>
            <li>Heelloo, how much money do you think you spent for it?</li>
            <li>Two zippered pockets, on large center pocket and eight divided pockets on each side, four are mesh!  </li>
            <li>The quality is fine for the price paid, however the shipping time is a big negative.  </li>
            <li>Like one of the other reviewers said, it doesn&#x27;t stand up very well in the purse though.</li>
            <li>It took a long time (about 3 weeks) to arrive, but at checkout, the probable delivery time was clearly stated.  </li>
            <li>This has been really useful and heavily used already!</li>
            <li>The bag she typically carries is large w/o compartments and she&#x27;s always fiddling around trying to find things.  </li>
            <li>Effective product but quality sucks!!!</li>
            <li>There was no other choice when I purchased than grey with Yellow.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The top zipper makes it work well in my briefcase-bag.</li>
            <li> Ordering more to give for christmas.</li>
            <li> I was able to put all my stuff in all of the pockets</li>
            <li> and I still have room for more.  </li>
            <li> and it happened with more than one purse, was that once I had everything in the organizer, the purse now felt heavier.  </li>
            <li> There are many pockets and segments where you can store your eye pencils, lipsticks, blushes, etcetera.</li>
            <li> Well made and cheap!</li>
            <li> and I will probably be ordering more...</li>

            <li> I would have ordered more than one</li>
            <li> though  it took a while to arrive it is nice to fit into diff purses tho</li>

            <li> I love it, my items are organized and it WS an affordable buy.</li>
            <li> ot any more.</li>
            <li> This product, especially off the price was perfect!!!</li>
            <li> It has snaps on the side so it can be more compact if you need it to be.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter for her birthday, she likes to change her purses very often, so I think this will be a great idea for her.</li>
            <li> This works great in my purse and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Many have asked where I got it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it -</li>

            <li> It was a fair price and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I was truly able to fit EVERYTHING from my purse into this organizer.  </li>
            <li> I imagine it&#x27;ll fit we&#x27;ll into most of my bags.</li>
            <li> This light weight organizer is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I lubricated them with silicone to make them work more smoothly</li>
            <li> i was really surprised at what a great product this was.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still a very functional organizer and definitely good value for the money.</li>
            <li> This product is very well made, and the material is really good.  </li>
            <li> This helps me keep everything organized neatly, plus makes it easy to transfer the contents whenever I switch bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I can find things easily in my purse and no more&lt;br /&gt;digging</li>
            <li> Perfect organized for those big Hobo type bags that I love so much.</li>
            <li> If I were to by again I would buy it in a longer length because the width is fine</li>
            <li> It worked fine as a gift.</li>
            <li> This product was made with cheap fabric and cheap zippers that tear or get stuck easily.</li>
            <li> I was expecting an insert that would reflect the cheap price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great concept.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand people who write reviews and state that the product is cheap.  </li>
            <li> What I liked best was the deep pockets, yet not so deep that things get lost.</li>
            <li> i love it now when i need something i can go right to it</li>
            <li> This is a very useful product</li>
            <li> I have a very large purse with ONE HUGE compartment!</li>
            <li> Makes changes quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for those who need a small organizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took some 3 weeks to arrive from China, and actually it&#x27;s pretty OK</li>
            <li> I recomiend this specially for frecuent travelers.</li>
            <li> there are plenty of pockets of various sizes for organization, which is good.</li>
            <li> MUCH better made than the Purseket &amp;reg; and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> As much as I love how much it holds, having to dig for items is a pain.  </li>
            <li> Great product and quality, works well for large open purses.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly into the bottom of my Bath &amp; Body Works tote, giving the limp bag some much needed structure.</li>
            <li> and I can easily transfer all my stuff to a different purse w/o any effort :)</li>
            <li> had I known it was this great for so little money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT WORTH THE WAIT.</li>

            <li> This item was worth its value.  </li>

            <li> I used the first one as a bag/purse insert</li>
            <li> If you have too many items, find something bigger.</li>
            <li> I ordered the organizer and it&#x27;s exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Could be better, but for the price, it&#x27;s a very solidly made piece.</li>

            <li> They were a HIT and were not expensive.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have given several away to friends and relatives and they all love it.  </li>
            <li> This is well made, very durable, many different sized pockets.</li>
            <li> I only got this today got all my stuff in and Love this so much</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how quickly this item arrived from Hong Kong (15 days).</li>
            <li> I only wish they make more variety to fit different.</li>
            <li> Pocket-wise, it&#x27;s very decent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; or find my way around the organizer, even though it sits at the bottom of a rather deep purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to pick up and change bags without extra time and fuss.</li>
            <li> I WILL CERTAINLY GET ANOTHER ONE.</li>
            <li> I purchased a purse that was just one large pocket.  </li>
            <li> There is a pocket or place for everything I carry in my large leather purse.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Pouch bag for my large purse</li>
            <li> cell phone etc so much easier.  </li>
            <li> This was really helpful.</li>
            <li> The idea behind it is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very versitile and holds alot.</li>
            <li> but that is because it holds so much.</li>
            <li> So much easier to find my stuff.</li>
            <li> In the case of this, the handles ripped off the first time I tried to transfer it to a new bag.</li>
            <li> well and exactly what I needed for a new no comparment bag</li>
            <li> I mostly carry smaller designer bags and this insert is all nylon/mesh and is pretty big.</li>
            <li> I personally will be using this on my wedding day (as my colors are gray and yellow), but it&#x27;ll be great to continue to use long after the wedding!</li>
            <li> I like all of the pockets to keep all of my loose items nice &amp; organized in my big purse.</li>
            <li> The rest of it still is intact, which is why I would still recommend it to someone who isn&#x27;t particularly attached to the idea of the handles staying...</li>
            <li> I use it to do quick change between different handbags.</li>
            <li> I can switch purses quickly and keep all my stuff in the same location.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very well made - even stitching with no raw edges, sturdy fabric.</li>
            <li> The sides and bottom are not stiff, so it really couldn&#x27;t hold up in a floppy purse.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Product came early &amp; is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering a few more as gifts.</li>
            <li> It did not hold up with normal use.</li>
            <li> The pouch looks quite good, and has 3 large compartments and a lot of small compartments, useful for storing small items.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has so many compartments for all those small things (pens,hair clip,lip gloss) which normally just be scattered all over my purse,</li>
            <li> okay, smaller that expected</li>
            <li> Since this organizer only arrived yesterday, I can only suppose how much I&#x27;ll enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> arrived early!  </li>
            <li> No more leaving important items in the purse I&#x27;m not carrying!</li>
            <li> First, it arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> There is no support in the large middle area (bottom).</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived.</li>
            <li> I only wish I&#x27;d bought it much sooner.</li>
            <li> Very compact (tiny compartments).  </li>
            <li> Wow a place for everything and everything in its place.</li>
            <li> Free Shipping with an estimated ship date of a few days.</li>
            <li> This product would be great for a diaper bag or a bigger casual bag.</li>
            <li> The organizer handle ribbed open on the 2nd day and 3weeks later the zipper broke and it was not even full of things.</li>
            <li> Heelloo, how much money do you think you spent for it?</li>
            <li> Two zippered pockets, on large center pocket and eight divided pockets on each side, four are mesh!  </li>
            <li> The quality is fine for the price paid, however the shipping time is a big negative.  </li>
            <li> Like one of the other reviewers said, it doesn&#x27;t stand up very well in the purse though.</li>
            <li> It took a long time (about 3 weeks) to arrive, but at checkout, the probable delivery time was clearly stated.  </li>
            <li> This has been really useful and heavily used already!</li>
            <li> The bag she typically carries is large w/o compartments and she&#x27;s always fiddling around trying to find things.  </li>
            <li> Effective product but quality sucks!!!</li>
            <li> There was no other choice when I purchased than grey with Yellow.  </li>
            <li> This little carrier has been a godsend in my bigger purses where everything normally falls to the bottom.  </li>
            <li> The organizer has snaps on both sides for those thin bags or you can leave it open to full size.  </li>
            <li> If you use a small purse and this is too large for that purpose</li>
            <li> I am not overly fond of yellow, do not have a problem with grey, but it doesn&#x27;t match any purse</li>
            <li> 2 zipper areas and center open area.</li>
            <li> I had to wait a long time</li>
            <li> : Yes the zippers are not amazing, they are actually pretty bad quality but the fabric is OK.</li>
            <li> Little yellow handles for lifting out, and it is washable!</li>
            <li> A little to big</li>
            <li> The organizer gets lost inside my handbag and items do not fit properly.  </li>
            <li> I like the pouch bag, It is what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> then I expected, but then again it came from china.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to search endlessly for my keys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m using another one as a make up organizer, and the other two are gifts.   </li>
            <li> While the other one had pockets on the inside and end, you can&#x27;t beat this deal.  </li>
            <li> Now if only i could remember which little pouch had what item!!</li>
            <li> Other than that you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> The only problem is it&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order these if you want them in any less time than a month.</li>
            <li> I have a tote bag that turns into a cluttered mess whenever I fill it up.  </li>
            <li> I could even slip a small table or e-reader in the center pouch as well.</li>
            <li> It was packaged well although it took a little longer to get here</li>
            <li> With paying so little, you wonder what you&#x27;ll end up with.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavy after it is loaded up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright purse insert, especially for $3.50, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> SHIPPING WAS A LITTLE SLOW</li>
            <li> Keep in mind when ordering that this product comes from China and takes longer to arrive than usual products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made for you to put weights inside, but it works well for your wallet and make up and small things around your bag.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> Not an issue with makeup supplies, however, nail polish bottles and such have a difficult time staying upright.</li>
            <li> Inserted a small plastic basket (from the dollar store) that I had laying around, worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to buy one to try, but not sure if you would like an organizer (have never had one)</li>
            <li> the small diaper bag I use for my grandson, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still hunting for things, but at least everything holds still while i hunt</li>
            <li> These literally arrived on a slow boat from China.  </li>
            <li> I change purses often and w/o fail, I am always leaving something in the other purse.  </li>
            <li> I expected some crap, due to the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is a little casual for what I need a purse organizer to be.</li>
            <li> Ugly but helpful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The handles got in the way and were annoying</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Zipper on one side broke within the first month ... doesn&#x27;t appear to be well made.  I still use it because it does have some great features, manufacturer just needs to upgrade/improve the zipper technology from plastic to metal.</li>
            <li> lots of pockets and handy to change in and out.Works great for my 31 market tote. Makes changes quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I love this bag. It fit perfect into my Coach purse to keep me organized. My friends are jealous of how cute it is.</li>
            <li> I have a tote bag that turns into a cluttered mess whenever I fill it up.  This helps me keep everything organized neatly, plus makes it easy to transfer the contents whenever I switch bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked a star off, because the zippers tend to stick so I don&#x27;t bother using those two pockets.  However, it&#x27;s still a very functional organizer and definitely good value for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright purse insert, especially for $3.50, but it&#x27;s not great. The sides and bottom are not stiff, so it really couldn&#x27;t hold up in a floppy purse. Not quite what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item... Has made me more organized and I am able to find my keys, cell phone etc so much easier.  All my items have a place and I don&#x27;t have to search endlessly for my keys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived early!  I have bought  additional bag organizers to give as a gift to my friends! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived. I was expecting an insert that would reflect the cheap price. Not so!! This is well made, very durable, many different sized pockets. Fits perfectly into the bottom of my Bath &amp; Body Works tote, giving the limp bag some much needed structure. I imagine it&#x27;ll fit we&#x27;ll into most of my bags.</li>
            <li> so happy i purchased this.  Now nothing gets lost inside my purse. Everything has its place and I can easily transfer all my stuff to a different purse w/o any effort :)</li>
            <li> This light weight organizer is fantastic! It makes switching hand bags super easy and I can always locate the items in my bag because they will always be in the same pockets no matter what hand bags I change to.</li>
            <li> i REALLY LOVE THIS ORGANIZER. IT HOLDS ALMOST EVERYTHING. I WILL CERTAINLY GET ANOTHER ONE. THE ZIPPER COMPARTMENTS  R AMAZING.  SHIPPING WAS A LITTLE SLOW BUT WORTH THE WAIT.</li>
            <li> The zipper broke after 2 times use. Not a surprise since it is made in China. I would rather pay more to own something that lasts.</li>
            <li> After the order got lost in transit, the manufacturer re-sent it. The wife is very happy with this one as it fits certain medium to large purses great. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like all of the pockets to keep all of my loose items nice &amp; organized in my big purse. Got 1 for each of my girls too!</li>
            <li> I am giving them for  gifts, so I have to wait and see how they are liked, but I like mine</li>
            <li> This was really helpful. I bought it to go in a tote bag I bought on Amazon which I used for my carry-on bag. This has plenty of room, zippers, pockets, pouches and everything all by itself. I could even remove it and take to the bathroom for my toiletry bag as it stood alone.&lt;br /&gt;The handles got in the way and were annoying but I felt that if I cut them off, I might later wish I hadn&#x27;t so I tolerated them.&lt;br /&gt;A great price and a good accessory which might be too big for most purses, but fit in my tote just perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you change purses often, this is the way to go! Just organize everything in this and then just place this in the bag you want to carry!! I am able to find everything quickly!!</li>
            <li> Love this pouch and its a great deal!</li>
            <li> I love it for organizing my travel bag. it is easy to move from one bag to another and it is very light weight.</li>
            <li> The product is of good quality and exactly as you see it in the picture.  The basic color looks gray in the photo but it is actually brown.&lt;br /&gt;It is very functional and an excellent deal considering how inexpensive it is!!!  I ordered three and am very happy with them.  Keep in mind when ordering that this product comes from China and takes longer to arrive than usual products.</li>
            <li> Does the job - add some stiff cardboard at the bottom for stability for a large purse or tote.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great concept. The idea behind it is great. And yes, you get what you pay for. In the case of this, the handles ripped off the first time I tried to transfer it to a new bag. The rest of it still is intact, which is why I would still recommend it to someone who isn&#x27;t particularly attached to the idea of the handles staying...well, attached.</li>
            <li> Same as described! I am using as a diaper bag!!</li>
            <li> I am a purse-aholic (what else fits you no matter what you weigh?! ;)) and I switch purses almost daily based on need, whether they match my clothing, etc. This makes it so simple to just throw it in and go. No more leaving important items in the purse I&#x27;m not carrying! I only wish I&#x27;d bought it much sooner.</li>
            <li> This works great for a medium to large size purse.  If you like to switch purses on a regular basis this is perfect!</li>
            <li> i use this every day to make my life easier..use one pocket for flashlight so i can always find everything</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand people who write reviews and state that the product is cheap.  Heelloo, how much money do you think you spent for it? Of course it&#x27;s cheap, isn&#x27;t it why you bought it?!  This product is very well made, and the material is really good.  What you see is what you get! (see photo too) It fits in my bag nicely and zippers work fine.  It&#x27;s not made for you to put weights inside, but it works well for your wallet and make up and small things around your bag. I&#x27;m ordering a few more as gifts. Edit: I got two more and they&#x27;re the same quality as the first one I ordered, and I have two more on the way.  These make organizing so much easy.  I used the first one as a bag/purse insert and I&#x27;m using another one as a make up organizer, and the other two are gifts.   Thank you to the seller for making these so neat and my last two came in a week!</li>
            <li> I got this bag for my sewing items and it works wonders for an extent. If you have too many items, find something bigger.</li>
            <li> A friend had one and I decided to give it a try.  So far, I really like it.  I&#x27;m no longer digging for stuff throughout my purse.</li>
            <li> Love this pouch I don&#x27;t forget my keys, etc. when changing bags.</li>
            <li> there are plenty of pockets of various sizes for organization, which is good. the not so good feature is that the sides are not structured so that it stands up in the purse...it just flops around.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has so many pockets and compartments.  It&#x27;s perfect to fit inside a tote or large bag to keep everything organized.  I personally will be using this on my wedding day (as my colors are gray and yellow), but it&#x27;ll be great to continue to use long after the wedding!</li>
            <li> Wasnt sure what to expect because it was so cheap, but this came quickly, is a perfect size and everything has its own place (there are even extra spots).  Have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> The Handbag Pouch is nicely made and got to me in a couple of days but it is a little casual for what I need a purse organizer to be. The description given is spot on so this is just my personal opinion and not a product flaw. I mostly carry smaller designer bags and this insert is all nylon/mesh and is pretty big. This product would be great for a diaper bag or a bigger casual bag. I am keeping it because it will be useful for my carry on travel bag.</li>
            <li> this was a great help in organizing my large purse. it held it&#x27;s shape. i love it now when i need something i can go right to it</li>
            <li> My mom was is the one that wanted a purse organizer and asked me to find one.  The bag she typically carries is large w/o compartments and she&#x27;s always fiddling around trying to find things.  I decided to order me one too - I change purses often and w/o fail, I am always leaving something in the other purse.  This item was worth its value.  My mom and I both love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered the organizer and it&#x27;s exactly as described. It&#x27;s very versitile and holds alot. Hopefully I won&#x27;t need to search for stuff anymore :)  It came earlier than predicted. I&amp;#34;m very happy with this purchase and the seller.</li>
            <li> This just arrived today.  The zippers are not a breeze to work, but I plan to put some lubricant on them to improve them.  I have many sack type pockebooks/ bags where this organizer would be a great help.  there are 2 zippered compartments.  the middle compartment is open.  I ordered one because i wanted to check the quality before ordering more.  It took a long time (about 3 weeks) to arrive, but at checkout, the probable delivery time was clearly stated.  I plan to stock up and use several as gifts for the 2014 gift giving season - that means I liked it enough to give it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Very compact (tiny compartments).  The organizer gets lost inside my handbag and items do not fit properly.  Not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> Pocket-wise, it&#x27;s very decent. Like one of the other reviewers said, it doesn&#x27;t stand up very well in the purse though. Could be better, but for the price, it&#x27;s a very solidly made piece. MUCH better made than the Purseket &amp;reg; and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Works great for makeup and manicure supplies. Room to spare, after emptying my &amp;#34;full to the brim&amp;#34; makeup bag. Sits sturdily on a wire shelf in my bathroom closet. There is no support in the large middle area (bottom). Not an issue with makeup supplies, however, nail polish bottles and such have a difficult time staying upright. Inserted a small plastic basket (from the dollar store) that I had laying around, worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Ugly but helpful.  It gets my 4 stars because it&#x27;s roomy enough to put all your things in and is rather well made for the price.  I would recommend it; in fact I bought a couple of more for my friends.</li>
            <li> NOW  i can keep everything in its place and change out my purse pretty quick when in a hurry thanks amazon</li>
            <li> What I liked best was the deep pockets, yet not so deep that things get lost. The top zipper makes it work well in my briefcase-bag.</li>
            <li> Loved it. This produce is very handy for organizing contents in purse. Simple way to change purses in a hurry.</li>
            <li> niceEshop Handbag Pouch Bag in Bag Organizer is just right for organizing my purse.  there are plenty of pockets for anything you need to carry with you.  It is a little heavy after it is loaded up but that is because it holds so much.</li>
            <li> Use this inside an emergency bag to take with me for problem moments. Got a quilted bag to insert this into, and works great. 2 zipper areas and center open area. Little yellow handles for lifting out, and it is washable!</li>
            <li> This bag organizer is perfect! It makes changing purses so easy and convenient. I like that it has so many compartments for all those small things (pens,hair clip,lip gloss) which normally just be scattered all over my purse, are now organized. So much easier to find my stuff. Ordering more to give for christmas.</li>
            <li> The organizer handle ribbed open on the 2nd day and 3weeks later the zipper broke and it was not even full of things. Effective product but quality sucks!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased a purse that was just one large pocket.  As much as I love how much it holds, having to dig for items is a pain.  I decided to give this a try, and it works great.  I was able to put all my stuff in all of the pockets and I still have room for more.  The reason this is not getting 5 stars is for one reason... the color.  There was no other choice when I purchased than grey with Yellow.  I am not overly fond of yellow, do not have a problem with grey, but it doesn&#x27;t match any purse I would put it in with these colors.  One thing I was not expecting when purchasing this, and it happened with more than one purse, was that once I had everything in the organizer, the purse now felt heavier.  The organizer itself is not causing extra weight, but the fact that all the items no longer can move/mold to my body and the purse but are in one spot puts extra pressure/weight on that and causes it to feel heavier.  If you are looking to buy one to try, but not sure if you would like an organizer (have never had one) this one is also made more sturdy in appearance and mechanics, and would make a good travel or auto safety kit organizer if it is decided a purse is not where you want it.</li>
            <li> I like the pouch bag, It is what I expected for the price. A little to big but, it works.</li>
            <li> It is great for a large purse. I can now find my things in my purse. There are all kinds of places to put your things.</li>
            <li> okay, smaller that expected</li>
            <li> Product came early &amp; is very sturdy. It has lot of  compartments which is a plus. The only problem is it&#x27;s very small. I thought it was bigger. It&#x27;s perfect for those who need a small organizer. I have a large tote which the organizer will get lost in!</li>
            <li> The pouch looks quite good, and has 3 large compartments and a lot of small compartments, useful for storing small items.  I use it to do quick change between different handbags.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how quickly this item arrived from Hong Kong (15 days). It seems to be very well made - even stitching with no raw edges, sturdy fabric. The zippers are made of plastic with over-size teeth. I lubricated them with silicone to make them work more smoothly and (I hope) last longer. Since this organizer only arrived yesterday, I can only suppose how much I&#x27;ll enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> There is a pocket or place for everything I carry in my large leather purse.  It&#x27;s easy to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; or find my way around the organizer, even though it sits at the bottom of a rather deep purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some mentioned, the plastic zipper is not as smooth-operating as it might be, but then I store infrequently used items in the zipper sections, so this has not been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product for a very good price.</li>
            <li> Great Buy! I Loved it. It is nice quality. It was a fair price and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I thought when I ordered this that it would be flimsy but it is not.&lt;br /&gt;It is everything I hoped it would be. I had to wait a long time but it arrived from China in 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;packaged well and exactly what I needed for a new no comparment bag I bought.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now waiting for Spring since the bag I purchased is yellow, exactly the color of the trim on the organiser.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use to organize my cosmetics and I&#x27;m very happy with it. There are many pockets and segments where you can store your eye pencils, lipsticks, blushes, etcetera. I have a fair amount of cosmetics and I&#x27;m very happy to have it nicely organized. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Lots of easy to see and use pockets.  Easy to remove from your purse and get it all without things falling out.  If you like everything organized, this has tons of pockets in different sizes.  Well made and cheap!</li>
            <li> I love this organizer! I can only name one con which has nothing to do with the product itself but rather with my personal preferences and that is that I wish it was a bit sturdier. Other than that you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Held up in customs&amp;#34; was the last time I heard.  4 months I have waited to get my hands on it...</li>
            <li> This little carrier has been a godsend in my bigger purses where everything normally falls to the bottom.  This pouch allows me to keep everything organized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. First, it arrived much sooner than expected. The quality is great and the price is amazing. I ordered two and I will probably be ordering more... So convenient!</li>
            <li> Love the bag. Keeps my purses organized and very affordable! I recomiend this specially for frecuent travelers. I can switch purses quickly and keep all my stuff in the same location.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like in the picture and it&#x27;s awesome in my purse. Kinda bulky though!</li>
            <li> My item finally arrived, ad it fits inside of my purse perfectly.  It was packaged well although it took a little longer to get here then I expected, but then again it came from china.  I think I will have plenty of space for all of my articles.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> With paying so little, you wonder what you&#x27;ll end up with.  i was really surprised at what a great product this was.  i have another one I paid much more for.  While the other one had pockets on the inside and end, you can&#x27;t beat this deal.  I would have ordered more than one had I known it was this great for so little money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is it took almost a month to get here which was within the specified time frame, but if you&#x27;re in a hurry for it, this isn&#x27;t the one to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice organizer bag that allows me to stand up my wallet and checkbook vertically without fishing around for them in the bottom. I can simply lift this organizer from one bag to another.  I could even slip a small table or e-reader in the center pouch as well. The quality is fine for the price paid, however the shipping time is a big negative.  These literally arrived on a slow boat from China.  Don&#x27;t order these if you want them in any less time than a month.</li>
            <li> This product was made with cheap fabric and cheap zippers that tear or get stuck easily. It did not hold up with normal use. I haven&#x27;t been using it but a month and it has holes in it and the ties to lift it out of the purse broke off on the second day.</li>
            <li> though  it took a while to arrive it is nice to fit into diff purses tho it is smaller than appears in pic it is actually very nice for the price!</li>
            <li> Well designed and manufactured...I will recommend to others. I only wish they make more variety to fit different. Size bags</li>
            <li> These are the nicest organizers for bags I have ever seen!  I use one in my camera bag and one for my purse!  I thought about getting three when I ordered but decided not to.  Mistake!  Two zippered pockets, on large center pocket and eight divided pockets on each side, four are mesh!  If you can&#x27;t organize your bag with that, give up!  The organizer has snaps on both sides for those thin bags or you can leave it open to full size.  Also has two lift out handles for ease of changing bags!  Well made, durable construction.  Took longer to get than most orders from Amazon, but they warn you about that!  Very happy with these and am considering ordering another one!  I can think of tons of uses for them!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for inserting into luggage &amp;  keeping toiletries etc. organized.  Well constructed, multiple sizes of inserts for different size containers.</li>
            <li> Wow a place for everything and everything in its place. Easy to pick up and change bags without extra time and fuss. Every lady should have one you will love it.</li>
            <li> I love it, my items are organized and it WS an affordable buy. If I were to by again I would buy it in a longer length because the width is fine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind making the choice of buying products from overseas but mentioning this in the description would be nice.Free Shipping with an estimated ship date of a few days. It wasn&#x27;t until I actually placed the order that I found out it would take 30+ days to get here. Will not make this same mistake twice!</li>
            <li> Need another one just a little bit smaller, but perfect for those of use that change purses often.</li>
            <li> Perfect organized for those big Hobo type bags that I love so much. The only problem is I was always searching for the item that I needed. ot any more. Everything is in its place. Also like the fact that I can just take it out and swith bags with ease.</li>
            <li> This is just the type of thing I was looking for!! I have a very large purse with ONE HUGE compartment! So everything that went into my purse went into multiple smaller cosmetic bags or it got lost and took forever to find! This product, especially off the price was perfect!!! So many pockets and plenty of space in the zippered compartments! Very pleased! Should&#x27;ve bought two!! Or three ;)</li>
            <li> The colors matched my bag perfectly! It has snaps on the side so it can be more compact if you need it to be.</li>
            <li> I get everything in perfect conditions and excellent weather I liked the organizer</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I was truly able to fit EVERYTHING from my purse into this organizer.  I ordered one for my Mom as well.  Now I wish I&#x27;d ordered a couple for my book bag, the small diaper bag I use for my grandson, etc.  It makes locating items in my purse SO much easier!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter for her birthday, she likes to change her purses very often, so I think this will be a great idea for her.</li>
            <li> Great for the large purses that don&#x27;t have compartments . nice that it has two zipper compartments also. This is a very useful product</li>
            <li> I expected some crap, due to the price.&lt;br /&gt;It took some 3 weeks to arrive from China, and actually it&#x27;s pretty OK: Yes the zippers are not amazing, they are actually pretty bad quality but the fabric is OK. Again - comparing to the price, it&#x27;s great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s see if it endures or will tear apart after one week.</li>
            <li> Very handy! This works great in my purse and is very sturdy. Great price. Many have asked where I got it.</li>
            <li> I gave these as purse organizer as Christmas gifts. The ladies loved them. They were a HIT and were not expensive.</li>
            <li> Yes, it holds everything snugly where i put it. Now if only i could remember which little pouch had what item!! I&#x27;m still hunting for things, but at least everything holds still while i hunt; everything&#x27;s not jumbled at the bottom of my bag.</li>
            <li> I love it it makes my pocketbook organize easier to find my key and stuff. When I change my pocketbook it&#x27;s just one pull and everything is there.</li>
            <li> Great product and quality, works well for large open purses.</li>
            <li> I love it - I can pick it up and move it to another purse in seconds. My daughter and I have given several away to friends and relatives and they all love it.  If you use a small purse and this is too large for that purpose you can still use it for a make-up bag in the bathroom or a nail polish orgainzer in your bedroom. Love, Love, Love.</li>
            <li> I only got this today got all my stuff in and Love this so much I ordered the larger one this one is for my smaller bags but I like the fact that I can get my hands on keys etc without dumping everything out</li>
            <li> I ordered Pouch bag for my large purse and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I can find things easily in my purse and no more&lt;br /&gt;digging through my purse to find things.</li>
            <li> Was a gift. It worked fine as a gift.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the bag organizer.  This has been really useful and heavily used already! I would happily shop here again!</li>
