            <li>Its awesome ...stays on and goes great with my dark hair.</li>
            <li>Love the shiny texture, it&#x27;s bright and resistant for many many hours.</li>

            <li>One of my favorite eye shadows.</li>
            <li>I love these eyeshadows.</li>

            <li>Love these colors.  </li>
            <li>but im sure i will like it.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>LOL They only see glimpses of your gorgeous shimmery lids when you blink. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>colors stay on most of the day, however I did notice the brightest shades fade a bit.</li>
            <li>I just love these shadows.</li>
            <li>They are beautiful and classy.</li>
            <li>These colors are lovely and applies smoothly without creasing throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>But the way the tones work against each other is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I like the blue too, but the greens in this palette are just gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Needs attention when applying because the sparkle is strong so if it sprinkles a bit on your lower lids and cheeks during application it will be visible (and quite sparkly).</li>
            <li>I love the color and how long it stays on, great product</li>
            <li>It wears off a little quicker than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s beautiful while it lasts!</li>
            <li>One of the light colors is just sparkles.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day which is important to me.</li>
            <li>packing, it was a present and the most important , that other person love it, colors are just great!!!</li>
            <li>I love these colors and they&#x27;re very shimmery!</li>
            <li>First time I bought this color, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Green is my favorite color, so I would be happy with this set anyway.</li>
            <li>with the right variety of colors!</li>
            <li>I plan on getting more very soon.</li>
            <li>I use the whole palette, inclusing the shimmery top coat and it looks fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like to warn everyone that while it is definitely worth buying (the colors are unique and work well together)</li>
            <li>You can wear the colors whatever way you would like, I personally like the lighter colors more :)</li>
            <li>The cream color is shimmery and intially layers well, but fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this particular eyeshadow layout</li>
            <li>the colors are really pretty!</li>
            <li>It goes on fairly easily and is really vibrant.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>The top is a pretty white glitter.  </li>
            <li>very birght!</li>
            <li>and what girl doesn&#x27;t like a compliment hahaha.</li>
            <li>I use a primer under this set and it really pops well.</li>
            <li>The colors are much brighter in person.  </li>
            <li>I  chose this rating because they are very  alluring.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a smokey eye with winged eyeliner; needs minimal blending with other colors because they&#x27;re similar to each other, with a bit of sparkle up by the brow. :-)</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m glad I found the color again.</li>
            <li>Wow, intense color!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Goes great with green eyes and dark hair.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more subtle colors, but they&#x27;re still pretty.</li>
            <li>The various shades of green that come with this one product is really nice and provides lots of mix and match options.</li>
            <li>wrote the same review for the blue palette, but wanted to mention one more thing about this green one.  </li>
            <li>I have brown hair and blue eyes and was surprised that I actually like this green palette a lot more than the blue!  </li>
            <li>this would be better but the color is too loud and a little dark for me.</li>

            <li> /shimmery is to only apply it to your LID, below your crease so people aren&#x27;t staring at sparkles all day long.</li>
            <li> Long lasting wear</li>
            <li> I recd them quickly, however, one package had one color completely broken up.</li>
            <li> the bottom taupe-looking is a shimmery yellow, and the green and blue shimmery colors are brighter than the picture makes them look.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on the purple and pink palettes.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The dark gunmetal-looking color is actually a matte forest green,</li>
            <li> SO I SOUGHT OUT OTHER AVENUES</li>
            <li> I will be ordering other colors</li>
            <li> personal preference to not going overboard on anything glittery</li>
            <li> Small enough for a little purse/makeup bag...</li>
            <li> The light grass green was very faint.</li>
            <li> I know, typical of drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> do not use the darkest color as an eye liner - I like black liner, but I do USE the eyeliner shade to darken the outer corner/crease a bit.</li>
            <li> I have bought the green duo pack before and I&lt;br /&gt;thought</li>
            <li> but when i put this on it made me want to wear it everyday because EVERYONE noticed that day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly collecting each of these Color Explosion shadow palettes.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work, sadly even with base this product lacks pigment.</li>
            <li> but they go on like dust and do not stay on, even with a fancy eye primer base.</li>

            <li> Goes great with green eyes and dark hair. Colors are brighter in person, which is great for me. Perfect for a smokey eye with winged eyeliner; needs minimal blending with other colors because they&#x27;re similar to each other, with a bit of sparkle up by the brow. :-)</li>
            <li> I love these colors and they&#x27;re very shimmery! One of the light colors is just sparkles. It wears off a little quicker than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s beautiful while it lasts!</li>
            <li> I love the color and how long it stays on, great product and I get compliments every day I wear it to work</li>
            <li> Its awesome ...stays on and goes great with my dark hair. I don&#x27;t wear alot of shadow but when i put this on it made me want to wear it everyday because EVERYONE noticed that day! and what girl doesn&#x27;t like a compliment hahaha. Seriously, it really does what it says, its great!</li>
            <li> I did not recieve the product I ordered. I was sent eyeliner instead of this eyeshadow. So beware when ordering.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and beautiful colors.. I really love this product. One of my favorite eye shadows. would totally recomend</li>
            <li> SEVERAL RETAILERS CARRIED IT BUT APPARANTLY MAYBELLINE DECIDED NOT TO PRODUCE IT ANYMORE SO I SOUGHT OUT OTHER AVENUES AND THAT WAS AMAZON</li>
            <li> I love these eyeshadows. They are beautiful and classy. You can wear the colors whatever way you would like, I personally like the lighter colors more :)</li>
            <li> Green is my favorite color, so I would be happy with this set anyway. But the way the tones work against each other is wonderful! I use a primer under this set and it really pops well.</li>
            <li> Wow, intense color! It goes on fairly easily and is really vibrant. The lightest colors have glitter or sparkles of some sort in them and they flake off all over the place. By midday, I&#x27;ve got sparkles under my eyes and on my cheeks! The darker colors smudge and tend to sit in the crease of my upper eyelid. Any reapplication needs to happen after some cleaning up.</li>
            <li> Perfect size! Small enough for a little purse/makeup bag...with the right variety of colors! I will be ordering other colors it comes in.</li>
            <li> I like the colors but they go on like dust and do not stay on, even with a fancy eye primer base.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture. Love the shiny texture, it&#x27;s bright and resistant for many many hours. Love this item.</li>
            <li> Love these colors.  Lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Color is so shiny and great...</li>
            <li> the colors are really pretty! i like what i see i just havent used it yet but im sure i will like it. cant wait to put it on</li>
            <li> I ordered 2. I recd them quickly, however, one package had one color completely broken up. Other than that, I&#x27;m glad I found the color again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work, sadly even with base this product lacks pigment. I know, typical of drugstore brands. But I was hopeful. The light grass green was very faint. The cream color is shimmery and intially layers well, but fades quickly. Sad.</li>
            <li> The colors are much brighter in person.  The dark gunmetal-looking color is actually a matte forest green, the bottom taupe-looking is a shimmery yellow, and the green and blue shimmery colors are brighter than the picture makes them look.  The top is a pretty white glitter.  I was hoping for more subtle colors, but they&#x27;re still pretty.</li>
            <li> These colors are lovely and applies smoothly without creasing throughout the day.  I would like to warn everyone that while it is definitely worth buying (the colors are unique and work well together), it is very tiny - but don&#x27;t let that deter you.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> very birght! beautiful greens to blend in together</li>
            <li> The various shades of green that come with this one product is really nice and provides lots of mix and match options. It stays on all day which is important to me. The shimmery color adds some nice pop.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with that purchase, it came on time well packing, it was a present and the most important , that other person love it, colors are just great!!!</li>
            <li> First time I bought this color, and I love it. I plan on getting more very soon. This is a great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly collecting each of these Color Explosion shadow palettes. Currently I have this one and the blue palette. Can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on the purple and pink palettes. LOVE them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the darkest color as an eye liner - I like black liner, but I do USE the eyeliner shade to darken the outer corner/crease a bit.

LOL They only see glimpses of your gorgeous shimmery lids when you blink. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors stay on most of the day, however I did notice the brightest shades fade a bit. I just stick the palette in my makeup bag and touch up the lightest shade if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the same review for the blue palette, but wanted to mention one more thing about this green one.  I have brown hair and blue eyes and was surprised that I actually like this green palette a lot more than the blue!  I like the blue too, but the greens in this palette are just gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Good color. Long lasting wear</li>

            <li> Great sparkle here, can&#x27;t be beat. Needs attention when applying because the sparkle is strong so if it sprinkles a bit on your lower lids and cheeks during application it will be visible (and quite sparkly).</li>
            <li> I  chose this rating because they are very  alluring. They blended with my eyes well. All of the shadows blended well and looked good on the eyes. I just love these shadows.</li>
