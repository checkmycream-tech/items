            <li>It makes my foundation (drugstore) look absolutely smooth and perfect.</li>
            <li>it goes on so smooth and perfect blend!!!</li>
            <li>I had heard a lot of good reviews and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Smells really good too.</li>
            <li>I still had to try it though and immediately upon using it, I loved it and haven&#x27;t stopped using it</li>
            <li>good deal.  </li>
            <li>so it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>For a week I struggled to get a good application</li>
            <li>The cleanser is also good and is convenient the way it is packaged.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of applying the concealer.      </li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>It is also convenient that it comes with the cleanser which smells good.  </li>
            <li>but it did not look good at all.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is good, too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it!Not good as cd blushes</li>
            <li>I loved the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I split the amount with my sister so it didn&#x27;t seem a lot for a good product.</li>
            <li>This blender can literally make ANYTHING look good.</li>
            <li>I loved this package, as it provides to sponges, instructions on use, and the cleanser.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is really good though.</li>
            <li>I am unsure as to whether it was, indeed, a good deal and also, whether I want to keep this item.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;D couldn&#x27;t be happier it was worth the splurge!</li>
            <li>This is also AWESOME because it came with the soap to clean them with...</li>
            <li>The cleanser is wonderful and the sponge truly comes clean.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and the cleanser works great on brushes as well.</li>
            <li>it makes you just have the most beautiful finish and boosts your confidence you never have to worry about your make up being noticeable or cakey it</li>
            <li>I use a liquid foundation and have very fair skin, so lines are a bit easy to see if I leave them on my face.</li>
            <li>The blenders are the best, but I think any mild soap would do for washing them.  </li>

            <li>Very excited!</li>
            <li>Sponge itself is amazing - my fave for even makeup application.</li>
            <li>All i can say its an amazing product.</li>
            <li>amazing for applying make up</li>
            <li>I use it with my foundation stick and it delivers amazing results.  </li>
            <li>but this is an amazing tool to have in your beauty arsenal.  </li>
            <li>is an amazing product i makes my makeup look</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to applying makeup with brushes or cheap sponges.  </li>
            <li>but it cleans the beauty blender and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This is one amazing blender sponge</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, the item is amazing.</li>
            <li>The cleaner is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>I use either Bobbi Brown or Amazing Cosmetics (both are dense creams).</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>do not even think about it, the blender is amazing</li>
            <li>The Beauty Blender is amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>They work amazingly.</li>
            <li>These sponges are amazing.</li>
            <li>the cleanser is amazing.</li>
            <li>Works really good love it👍</li>
            <li>how effectively it blended foundations, concealer and creams.</li>
            <li>It does not cake up and it blends out so nicely with this sponge.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because honestly, I have no idea how to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>This product honestly revolutionized the way I do my makeup.</li>
            <li>But it is kind of a hassle and in my opinion, overpriced.</li>
            <li>This sponge is spectacular - I am amazed by it.  </li>
            <li>Girls who still don&#x27;t own it they have to.</li>
            <li>wors great makeup goes on flawless and even will definatly buy another one in the future bought one for my mom also</li>
            <li>It really blends in the makeup perfectly!</li>
            <li>Best make up applicator, it really doesn&#x27;t compare with others in the market.</li>
            <li>but it is kind of pricey</li>
            <li>and I tried cleaning it on my own shampoo</li>
            <li>Or anyone that wants a dewy perfect foundation or powder!</li>
            <li>The sponge makes applying foundation so much nicer than a brush and practically makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>and they have held up nicely.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is really nice</li>
            <li>(and the cleanser does smell really nice )</li>
            <li>cleanser is a nice size (5 oz.)</li>
            <li>The shape of these sponges is perfect for the application of makeup, but I always tend to end up with too much makeup on when I use it.</li>
            <li>But, the cleanser is nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice scent, smells like lavender and tea tree.</li>
            <li>However, I can see the packaging being a nice storage place for everything too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if your own brush cleanser or baby shampoo would work just as well.  </li>
            <li>but it just works so nice...</li>
            <li>It is good and convenient, but not as magical as they hype seemed to be.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t tell if its entirely effective because the color is still on my sponge</li>
            <li>The absolute best way to apply product on your face!</li>
            <li>Heard all the good things about it and glad I bought the blender and cleaner pack</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this item out since I heard great things about it.</li>
            <li>i like it very much, this is a very good one that i chose .</li>
            <li>On a side note, the cleanser works great to clean brushes too.</li>
            <li>Best investment and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love that is comes with 2 beauty blenders and a soap always have loved beauty blenders and this is a very good deal and fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money and helps blend make up beautifully.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my purchase, love the scent of the soap</li>
            <li>The Blender is the best makeup sponge I have ever used (read all the reviews of the Blender if you want more details on that), and the cleanser is definitely worth the money. :)</li>
            <li>I feel like it does a great job of filling in the pores to give a more smooth finish.</li>
            <li>the beauty blender is great for applying liquid foundation you have to use it wet for best results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly impressed, I never thought I&#x27;d love a sponge so much.</li>
            <li>The makeup comes out quickly and it smells great.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully and made my concealer/foundation look very natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This has many, many uses and will help you apply make up like a pro!</li>
            <li>i love this! :)</li>
            <li>I honestly like my brushes better.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still the best method I&#x27;ve found so far, since an all creme/liquid approach leaves me looking like a geisha and</li>
            <li>I still think the products are over priced, but I will buy them again because of the way it applies my makeup--darn near flawless.</li>
            <li>I really love this one makes my makeup look really nice</li>
            <li>This is far by the best beauty sponge out there</li>
            <li>Brushes, fingers,&lt;br /&gt;sponge wedges and the Beautyblender by far is the best!</li>
            <li>I was doubting this when I bought it, but wow it works great!</li>
            <li>The cleanser is amazing and of course I love the beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>Seems the easiest and most effective way.</li>
            <li>but when I use my BeautyBlender sponge my skin looks flawless but natural.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how well it cleans without the beauty blender cleanser, but the cleanser has a nice scent and seems to get most of the makeup out of the sponge.</li>
            <li>I love this handy tool.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best foundation application method on the market.</li>
            <li>Goes on beautifully and blends very well!</li>
            <li>Honestly, by far the best investment I&#x27;ve made when comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li>The sponge is soft,  and just the perfect size so that it&#x27;s not bulky to hold.</li>
            <li>Love love love the beauty blender!</li>
            <li>Then, get it real nice and soaked and get all the soap out and all the color should come out and your sponge will look like new again!</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and pleasant.    </li>
            <li>Overall great purchase for a great price.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d feel about using BM with a damp applicator, but honestly, I think it works wayyyyyy better.</li>
            <li>It does a beautiful job covering acne scars and large pores.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend the sponges work incredibly well.</li>
            <li>the cleaner is also awesome as you can use it to clean all of your brushes not just the blender and its a large size cleaner as well.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really fast and beautiful application of foundation.</li>
            <li>Great item &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product but the sponge doesn&#x27;t have the effect on my face as it did the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>it is very perfect and make it as it new again I strongly recommended</li>
            <li>was quick!!</li>
            <li>I apply my liquid foundations exclusively with beauty blenders as the provide a nice buildable application that is easy to control and does not leave seams or brush stroke lines that many brushes do.</li>
            <li>And very easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Like many people who wanted to save money, I opted for the knock off first, none ever did as good a job as the original!!</li>
            <li>The Beauty Blender makes it really easy and nice to apply foundation, and although I prefer using make-up remover and bar soap to clean brushes, the cleanser is really nice and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the Beauty Blender, however this one broke (I didn&#x27;t think a sponge could break!)</li>
            <li>LOVE these!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>makeup blends so much better</li>
            <li>ok just read the package and follow the instructions)</li>
            <li>Love these sponges.  </li>
            <li>The flawless finish it creates is an extra bonus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just an ok product.</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Better than applying makeup with a brush or your fingertips.</li>

            <li>and I love the light smell that it has!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried too many gimmicks...</li>
            <li>Most of it will get soaked up by the Beautyblender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cannot even begin to describe how much better my makeup application is.</li>
            <li>It makes for such an even, flawless appearance.</li>

            <li>Glad I bought it</li>
            <li>I love beauty blenders and will continue to repurchase them until they&#x27;re no longer made.</li>
            <li>but I love the BB</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast shipping and great care</li>
            <li>and you get two applicators, more for the $$.</li>
            <li>Love this product helps with blending and contouring foundation</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than using a brush</li>
            <li>I was so glad.</li>
            <li>but so many people rave about it that I wanted to see what the buzz was all about..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than a brush</li>
            <li>but I found it just ok.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered.</li>
            <li>One more thing....if you use a foundation that has adjustable coverage by applying it twice in certain areas, you&#x27;ll probably find this sponge very effective in application.</li>
            <li>I first apply the foundation to my face with a large concealer brush then blend it with my damp beautyblender and it blends perfectly!</li>
            <li>Blends contour beautifully, giving a natural finish!</li>
            <li>It leaves an amazing clean finish.  </li>
            <li>I use it to clean my makeup brushes and it works effectively.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I love that it can be washed every single day, and I especially love that you can use it damp.</li>
            <li>First I used the pointy end to apply and blend the creme concealer with surprisingly good results.</li>
            <li>It makes it so beautiful and seamless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and easy!</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this deal!</li>
            <li>So easy to apply (just make sure sponge is damp), and apply in a bouncing/stippling motion.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re especially wonderful for people with dry skin because of the moisture being pressed into the skin with whichever product you choose to use on the blender.</li>
            <li>I perfect for my dry skin type.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned above, it&#x27;s done the best job at applying powder products for me by leaving a smooth and silky finish instead of a chalky looking one.  </li>
            <li>By simply bouncing the applicator on my face (stippling) the makeup is applied flawlessly without soaking into the sponge and my pores are nicely filled in.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin look naturally flawless, instead of making the foundation sit on top of it and get dry looking  -Very easy to use quickly  </li>
            <li>All time favorite love it so much!!!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice and easy to use nothing special.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten about the BB completely until I came across this awesome deal right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>one of the sponges was loose in the box but still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Used the liquid cleaner on my cosmetic brushes and they came clean!</li>
            <li>I figured out how to get the beauty blender completely clean!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all clean!</li>
            <li>Subsequently, I used Dove body wash to clean the sponge and it works wonderfully with no  staining from the makeup.  </li>
            <li>My skin just looks so much more even and flawless (even though it is certainly NOT under the makeup)!</li>
            <li>All makeup guru will agree that beauty blenders are an important item in all makeup artist or collectors. :-)</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t explain why the BeautyBlender is the best foundation applicator I have found, because it makes absolutely no sense to me.  </li>
            <li>I started using the Real Techniques sponge and loved it.</li>
            <li>When you use it right, your skin looks amazing and airbrushed -</li>
            <li>I saw all the reviews at Youtube and it is amazing, you just should be carefull with the right care of the sponge</li>
            <li>Love the Beauty blender, helps blend in makeup so much better than a brush and with this cleanser, it is super easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>I purchased an authentic Original Beauty Blender from Sephora and I was looking to replace it.</li>
            <li>The  authentic Original Beauty Blender did not have these rings.</li>
            <li>I bought my beauty blenders back in March and have really loved them!</li>
            <li>It cleans the sponge easily.</li>
            <li>The BeautyBlender is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this sponge, and this is such a great deal for two of them and the cleaner.</li>
            <li>makes my makeup application so easy.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as EASY as it&#x27;s made out to be.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use too.</li>
            <li>You can easily dab the product around creases by the nose, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SUCH a good deal to buy on Amazon and the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>This sponge is sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>if I used it for a lot that day than i have to clean it like that more than once</li>
            <li>Secondly, the cleanser is great but the packaging leaves more to be desired.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the complaints are about, the dispenser worked fine and the sponge cleaned up easily.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments and my makeup looks &amp;#34;flawless!&amp;#34; For the most part, I use them wet and the results are great.</li>
            <li>I first learned of the Beautyblender from reading Jessica Alba&#x27;s book, The Honest Life.</li>
            <li>say, one of them expanded into double its size beautifully.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best makeup sponge i have ever used, and being a pro makeup artist i have used allot!</li>
            <li>I am fine with my finger application</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s had been many, many months since I started using the first one..</li>
            <li>Although it takes a bit more time than my usual applicator, the Beautyblender leaves an incredible air brush like finish!</li>
            <li>The application is easy and the look is smooth.</li>
            <li>It is fine.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner seems fine</li>
            <li>With this wonderful little sponge, I can rest easy knowing I won&#x27;t get cake face or streak marks</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, and carry on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the container is great and offers a great way to dry the blenders.  </li>
            <li>The blender will grow in size and be a little damp, but works best this way.</li>
            <li>Ordered as a gift for my daughter and she can&#x27;t say enough great things about how smoothly and evenly it applies makeup.</li>
            <li>Creates a smooth finish and is easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE skeptic when it comes to beauty tools.  </li>
            <li>It makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s made a HUGE difference...</li>
            <li>Contour queens may enjoy using this as well to blend in</li>
            <li>I definitely think that this product is a great investment</li>
            <li>such a great deal.</li>
            <li>do as instructed and have a smooth makeup look no smudge no nothing</li>
            <li>It is great for blending concealer, and especially for blending around areas like your nose or eyes.</li>
            <li>The product is fantastic and the cleanser works like a dream.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t pass it up, such a great deal.</li>
            <li>I was told you could use sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>The sponge is easy to clean and the cleanser works on brushes too.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for liquid foundation and cream blushes.</li>
            <li>I use the sponge during my entire make up routine and it works great to blend foundation, bronzer, eyeshadows,</li>
            <li>It was smooth and all my pores were filled in with no streaks or edges.  </li>
            <li>such a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s velvety smooth</li>
            <li>was gonna order the cheap version</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s piece of mind knowing your applicator is bacterial free there</li>
            <li>its like getting the cleaner for free.  </li>
            <li>This is an all-in-one tool that is great for a air brushed finish!</li>
            <li>it allows your makeup to go on smoothly and without lines.  </li>
            <li>And the cleanser is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have used a Foundation Brush for years and thought nothing could beat the the look of my makeup, until a friend of mine came to visit that I had not seen in a couple of months and her face looked FANTASTIC--</li>
            <li>The cleaner that comes with them works amazingly and doesn&#x27;t take much at all to cleanse them.</li>
            <li>I have tried cleaning them with gentle soap, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as effective as the cleanser that comes with them.  </li>
            <li>and it went on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The sponge applicator is so easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>and it gives a smooth even appearance.  </li>
            <li>The sponges make for a smooth even application.</li>
            <li>I have been using the foundation brushes for awhile now, but it doesnt leave a smooth finish like the blender does.  </li>
            <li>It makes you makeup looking fresh for many hours.</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to use the pump on the cleanser to clean off the sponge.</li>
            <li>I found that it helps a lot to use a light powder to set it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub on smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li>I got two BB’s with the liquid cleanser for $30 which seemed like a great deal compared to what they sell for individually.</li>
            <li>The delivery was smooth and prompt.</li>
            <li>Great deal for 2 beauty blenders and the daily cleaner.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, my blender rarely sees the inside of the packaging it came in.</li>
            <li>enjoy the cleanser</li>
            <li>for the sponges, I think that they are made very well and having two comes in handy.</li>
            <li>The BeautyBlender is fantastic.</li>
            <li>And the sponges themselves are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars since I faithfully use the sponge everyday for flawless Lancome makeup application.</li>
            <li>The price is AMAZING for 2 AND cleaner..shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>I just use the stipple effect and it feels light and airy.</li>
            <li>however I found it most useful for me to buff out my concealer with.</li>
            <li>Forget using those cheap sponges.</li>
            <li>Pricy, but useful, just not as magical as I thought it would be &#x27;cause</li>
            <li>It distributes your foundation throughout your whole face in a nice even layer.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and ever wondered how a sponge could make you look flawless, it really works!&lt;br /&gt;Rating only 4 starts because the sponge cleaner smells like ginger</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try a different foundation just because i&#x27;ve watched and read so many good reviews about this product.</li>
            <li>I already owned one Beauty Blender, and I bought this combo because I loved the first Blender that much!</li>
            <li>I was already a big fan of beauty blenders before - they really do give your skin a flawless &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>Seller was authentic and shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li>Trying to wash it right after use is time-consuming and takes more effort.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it will fix that right up. :)</li>
            <li>I would think warm or hot water could certainly cause more color</li>
            <li>I would think warm or hot water could certainly cause more color loss.  </li>
            <li>THis is very worth the try</li>
            <li>When I first got them I thought they both felt very cheap and tried to google if this Amazon store sold me cheap knock-offs.</li>
            <li>I use much less of my product and the cleanser is nice as well with a pleasant herbal</li>
            <li>Every good thing I&#x27;ve ever heard about the beauty blender is completely 100% true</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t absorb all your makeup like sponges and cleanup is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>They leave a flawless finish with little effort , even when I&#x27;m in a hurry !</li>
            <li>but with this one is so fast, very easy</li>
            <li>My new best friend and now part of my daily makeup ritual.</li>
            <li>I even use the large end to apply blush, and then squeeze it to make it smaller for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product I still love using.</li>
            <li>I love love this sponge, I was very skeptical about the performance, but based on all the great reviews I decided to splurge and order it, and I am so glad I did, this not only makes my foundation look flawless</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>wrks great, makes my make up application super simple.</li>
            <li>Super easy to clean and affordable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t soak up a huge amount of foundation like cheap sponges do, and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I originally read about it in a magazine, and pre-ordered it from amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Without a face primer, make up looks great and lasts for a long time (about 4 to 5 hours for me).</li>
            <li>im so excited on using the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I was soooo excited about these, thinking they were the holy grail of makeup application.</li>
            <li>It feels cool on my skin because it is damp and this may also be the reason why it does not soak up a lot makeup as the pores in the sponge are already filled with water.  </li>
            <li>artist friend convinced me to get the original</li>
            <li>Application is flawless, blended, and even, more so than my most expensive foundation brushes or sponges.</li>
            <li>When I soaked it (as you&#x27;re supposed to do before use), it &amp;#34;swelled&amp;#34; to the size of my original well used sponge.</li>
            <li>It also feels so fresh when applying make up!</li>
            <li>But it is not as travel friendly as a makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended, well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>your fun!</li>
            <li>and I have had so many compliments on my makeup just in the first week that I have been using it.</li>
            <li>this product is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited to use it.</li>
            <li>was converted to the beautyblender a long time ago and was so happy when I found this steal.</li>
            <li>when I first got the blender I tore some holes in the top from my nails.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an original.</li>
            <li>It it original...</li>
            <li>They were totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>I had tried many other soaps before this one to clean my beauty blander but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Also it is a pain in the butt to keep all of those brushes clean.    </li>
            <li>I was sold, even used the pointy end to clean up an eye makeup oops without messing up my foundation.    </li>
            <li>Part of the reason it was so easy to clean is that the sponge absorbed almost no product, so everything was just on the surface.</li>
            <li>but I know it is clean when the water runs</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: The Beautyblender did begin to \\&quot;bleed pink\\&quot; soon after I posted my review, and does every time I clean it.  </li>
            <li>I also use it to clean my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>and I clean</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about bacteria in the sponge because you clean it with every use.</li>
            <li>I do clean it with the cleanser</li>
            <li>Had to re clean all my brushes to get that smell out.</li>
            <li>I clean my brushes every two weeks instead of waiting 2</li>
            <li>I swish them around again and just rinse them off by swishing them in the bucket with clean water once or twice</li>
            <li>It will clean your sponge..</li>
            <li>the pointed tip area of the sponge always comes clean.</li>
            <li>You can clean the sponge with something else.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think is something amazing, kinda expensive, but the cleanser is the best I ever used</li>
            <li>The foundation transfers from the BB to the pump, so you have to clean that up.</li>
            <li>and I will also use it to clean brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I clean my every day.</li>
            <li>- To be used to clean Beautyblender after every use.</li>
            <li>I had been using hand soap to clean it with.</li>
            <li>(Packaging is super important to me because I tend to repurpose it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Cleaning the blender is SUPER important.</li>
            <li>I was using soap to clean my sponges</li>
            <li>It seems to clean up easier that way.</li>
            <li>Clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t clean the makeup off the sponge.</li>
            <li>The skin ranged from mature to supple (the mother of the bride, the bride and her younger sisters) and the result for everyone was flawless airbrushed looking skin.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my brushes.</li>
            <li>love the fact that I can apply my concealer - still use a brush for that, but then use the sponge on top and what a natural blend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Somebody posted on here how to get it clean, but I will reiterate it:  </li>
            <li>You will need it to clean your sponge.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean that well</li>
            <li>It has a very light lavender fragrance and is gentle and soy-based.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on very smooth and it cleans up very well.  </li>
            <li>It is designed right, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is also fantastic, it cleans the sponge and its great on all my other brushes.</li>
            <li>I love how the BeautyBlender has the large end</li>
            <li>My routine before was I would put either a moisturizer or a primer, sometimes on special occasions</li>
            <li>I wanted to know what the hype was, and let me say that the hype is RIGHT!</li>
            <li>It makes the bristles clean, soft and smell nice.</li>
            <li>Make up sponges are available for fraction of the cost in the pharmacy, and I&#x27;m not saying they would do as good of a job, but for someone on tight budget that could be a much better option.  </li>
            <li>Not quite sure how long the sponge will remain effective  </li>
            <li>and I wash it after every use overall pretty happy with this product it</li>
            <li>After a couple of months of using it, I found that it absorbs so much of my foundation, hence not giving me full coverage, and I would have to use more foundation.</li>
            <li>Thought the deal was great but expected it to be the full size Beauty Blenders, not the minis.</li>
            <li>they are the authentic, real beautyblenders and they are</li>
            <li>but I also have better coverage since the sponge doesn&#x27;t absorb much product.</li>
            <li>It will get your beautyblender super clean AND it will prolong the life of your beautyblender..</li>
            <li>Save your money or buy the real thing from Sephora or a well known store because this is not the authentic product...</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and a must-have whether you are a make-up newbie or guru! :)</li>
            <li>I love the Beautyblender, it really blends the make up very well, leaves your face so smooth!</li>
            <li>brushes that need a good deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon:)</li>
            <li>The cleanser is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the sponges, not so much on the liquid.</li>
            <li>I get a much more airbrushed look without wasting too much product.</li>
            <li>just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey but for 2 and the cleaner such a good buy</li>
            <li>However, I love the smell of the cleanser so much that I keep buying it.</li>
            <li>After googling DIY cleanser (because this stuff ain&#x27;t cheap) I decided the Beauty Blender Cleanser was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to worry if I have a full coverage because the blender does the work for you.</li>
            <li>So, basically I paid double the price for one good piece.</li>
            <li>It makes coverage better and doesn&#x27;t use as much as I do when using a brush.</li>
            <li>And I like full coverage</li>
            <li>Love the beauty blender it really works.</li>
            <li>But I love the Beauty Blender so much I have not even opened the others.</li>
            <li>If it seems too good to be true its because it is... BIG DISSAPOINTMENT</li>
            <li>I am super fair skinned and Its a constant battle of finding the proper shade and application technique in order to make my face look good, not cakey.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and product was exactly how it was described!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to dab for larger areas (you don&#x27;t want to drag your skin anyways) and the smaller pointy tip is great for under eye concealer and for even smudging eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use this with my foundation, concealer, cream blush, even my Bare Minerals powder, and it really blended everything nicely.</li>
            <li>The cleaner is great too, i also clean my brushes with it, takes lipstick and other oily products off like a dream!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve even quickly gone through a quarter of that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t take much at all to get the BeautyBlender clean again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m super paranoid that it will mold.</li>
            <li>So I looked on Amazon for cheaper prices and I got lucky and found this package deal.</li>
            <li>Super , I used when I put on my foundation</li>
            <li>I finally found a great color from Haba USA, but the foundation is a very runny liquid.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to clean with the cleanser, but dont use too much.</li>
            <li>Blends make up really well and easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t has this issue if I use mild hand soap or Clinique \\&quot;Take the Day Off\\&quot; Makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make sure I place my next order 2-3 wks after ordering a sponge to make sure I have a replacement.</li>
            <li>Ordering the double blender kit with the cleanser was such a great deal!</li>
            <li>and I hope to resolve this issue quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick tip:</li>
            <li>Luckily I happened to watch a beauty blogger on youtube</li>
            <li>I highly recommend :-)</li>
            <li>The price point is a little intimidating, but after having used it for a few months, I believe the excellent quality makes it a good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the BeautyBlender.. do not waste your money on &#x27;dupes&#x27; - none truly compare to the original..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normally a lot more for two sponges at Sephora and it doesn&#x27;t include the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo and though it smells better than the beauty blender cleanser, I now feel as though my blender and the brushes are thoroughly washed and cleaned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s best to clean when it&#x27;s dry and start by massaging in the cleanser or the dry BB before adding water and massaging to clean.</li>
            <li>LOVE my new BB &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Even though they seemed like they would only be good to use with liquid foundation, I decided to try using them with the mineral foundation first just for the heck of it.</li>
            <li>I have good (but dry) skin, but I like how I can get things even with this</li>
            <li>I have fair, dry, and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Ok first of all I&#x27;m very picky</li>
            <li>I enjoy cleaning them its pretty fun.</li>
            <li>It did about as good a job as those single use sponges you can get at any drugstore.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the beauty blender cleanser in the solid form is better!</li>
            <li>Already using the blender, I needed a new one and the price was great for a double set plus the cleaner.</li>
            <li>They apply makeup just as good as the cheap, old style wedge puffs you find at your local drug store for just couple bucks for a full bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cleanser is amazing too, it really does clean the beautyblenders better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>However, it does clean really well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, this is a great little tool to have.</li>
            <li>This is a great little kit to get you started with the Beautyblender sponges.  </li>
            <li>but you will see that if you let it go too long without a nice clean the effectiveness will go with it.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;dud&amp;#34; is more difficult to clean and doesn&#x27;t feel as great as the true beauty blender.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say that it would make a huge difference than using something gentle like baby wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important to note to be considerably gentle.</li>
            <li>It made the foundation that I washed out look a bit bright pink.</li>
            <li>The cleaner is amazing for not only the beauty blender itself but even my brushes!!!</li>
            <li>The foundation does not go on smoothly as the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Also, both sponges have these rings around it as though a machine just freshly shaved them.</li>
            <li>The cleanser also so useful.</li>
            <li>Then, under warm water, just splash a tiny bit of water on it, and work it in.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>So worth it..</li>
            <li>or so keeps it fresh</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>so I use thick full coverage makeup- Mac studio fix - and it went on beautifully.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is not an economical way to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for ways to improve the application of my liquid foundation, so far my fingers have been my favorite form of application.</li>
            <li>my foundation looks way more natural</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the wash, it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup from the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny I paid..</li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite way to apply liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>Then I use the Beautyblender to actually blend things out nicely.  </li>
            <li>I found that it does give more natural coverage than using brushes.</li>
            <li>But I love this product so far.</li>
            <li>but, it has been so worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many sponges to blend my foundation ( I switch between a liquid and a mineral powder) so that it looks natural.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s worth it, though, in my opinion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also tried my own facial cleanser</li>
            <li>Using the blender, my skin looks dewy and fresh and I don&#x27;t need powder.  </li>
            <li>But I think I got one with the old flip top packaging instead of the pump</li>
            <li>and they seemed to have absorbed a lot of the foundation, but not with the beauty blender.  </li>
            <li>My entire face looked flawless and there wasn&#x27;t any lines or inconsistencies, everything just sort of spreads out evenly.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>Worth the price??</li>
            <li>so it is worth it.</li>
            <li>So I let it sit for about 8 hours while I was at work, came home and started to rinse it and GENTLY massage the soap out and the whole thing started to fall apart!!!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this is hands down the best product to apply foundation, cream blush, concealer, and pretty much any other formula.</li>
            <li>It just takes a second to clean and well worth the extra step for great looking make up.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to clean and I like the cleanser, but I must admit that I use it with my Cetaphil daily cleanser to clean my sponges.</li>
            <li>$30 (or more) is a big investment for a set of makeup sponges, but the results are truly worth it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean (way easier than washing my foundation brush and waiting for it to dry).</li>
            <li>It shipped quick and was the real deal!</li>
            <li>I was SO reluctant to buy the cleanser because I was certain I could get it clean without it...</li>
            <li>Only downside is that it stains, so make sure you clean it often.</li>
            <li>Another reason to make sure to clean your blender regularly!  </li>
            <li>I do clean the bigger brushes in the palm of my hands before rinsing since they are more dense</li>
            <li>The only think i dont love is having to rub the sponge to clean.</li>
            <li>I bought the beautyblender due to all the good reviews on youtube.  </li>
            <li>I bought the original Beauty Blenders cheaper than here at Camera Ready Cosmetics website</li>
            <li>exactly as described and i am overall very satisfied with my purchase, thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this and highly recommend it for anyone who wants an airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>So I can literally wash it right before I use</li>
            <li>right? ..</li>
            <li>never quite looked right&#x27;</li>
            <li>They came right on time</li>
            <li>and then I apply the cleanser to my beauty blender with a tad bit of water and it takes the product right off.</li>
            <li>right so it spilled.</li>
            <li>I suppose any gentle body wash or makeup remover will clean it as well  </li>
            <li>Chantecaille&#x27;s cream-style Future Skin was excellent in texture but too dark for me, for example.    </li>
            <li>Overall, hands down, one of my best beauty purchases EVER!    </li>
            <li>This little sponge is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I find I get the best results when I clean the beautyblender after each use and let it completely air dry before the next use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product makes applying makeup so easy, and so natural appearing!  </li>
            <li>My makeup goes on perfectly every time, and I think it actually takes me LESS time using this BeautyBlender than it took me when I was using my fingers to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>wet or dry works wonderful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this just for a few days, and its amazing!</li>
            <li>so that was kind of strange</li>
            <li>As long as your cleanser isn&#x27;t cream based, I would think you could use a dab of your own cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of a Beautyblender, it&#x27;s really great for getting the right coverage with oily foundations, especially drugstore foundations.</li>
            <li>Since I own these cute sponges, I hardly reach for my foundation brushes.</li>
            <li>I still apply my pressed powder with the regular puff it comes with, because I need a fair amount of powder on top due to my oily skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, gives an airbrush look, easy to use, easy to clean, and the cleaner can be used for regular brushes as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried the blenders twice so far, and both times I&#x27;ve loved the results.</li>
            <li>if you like it and you have a good idea when u typically need to replace you can sign up to have it shipped to you as a subscription for even cheaper.</li>
            <li>This sponge is a wonder tool, no lines, supper soft, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>sure to wait until the sponge is dry to clean it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I was able to save a few bucks in this wasteful purchase.</li>
            <li>It really does leave my make-up looking more natural and radiant.  </li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t get a good lather and had used half the bottle.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Product was tossed around a bit</li>
            <li>But back to this review; I was surprised that the cleanser was a good size bottle</li>
            <li>I used mine dry, for a more full coverage, and use the tapered side to blend out concealer.</li>
            <li>but there is only a very, very light scent</li>
            <li>I put the cleanser on the BB and very gently massaged it and worked the soap in</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used very much at all</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s easy to create a transition between the makeup on my face and my neck, without applying makeup all the way down my neck.</li>
            <li>Normally the way we would clean our make up brushes is to swirl them into the palm of our hand with soap and water,</li>
            <li>I used to clean them again with hand soap after soaking just to make sure it was really clean, but after finding that no makeup residue was showing up anymore after a few brushes, I just rinsed them off.  </li>
            <li>I like the cleanser very much also although I&#x27;m sure I could get the same results from using an antibacterial hand soap to cleanse the sponge.</li>
            <li>and but the sponges always come clean and look new again...</li>
            <li>Also, for the first year I started using the beautyblender - I refused to buy the BeautyBlender cleanser..</li>
            <li>I hesitated for months before buying this item because I thought how could a sponge be worth that much $???</li>
            <li>It definitely takes more time compared to cleaning brushes.</li>
            <li>first so I could include it.</li>
            <li>Of course I only tried it with powder, it may soak up more liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>those interested in the blue sponge that can be found at Target, be aware that the foam material used to make it is more dense and it does not \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; on your face quite as well.</li>
            <li>For those interested in the blue sponge that can be found at Target, be aware that the foam material used to make it is more dense and it does not \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; on your face quite as well.</li>
            <li>Before I used mine the first time, I washed my sponge with the included Blender Cleaner under hot water, and it didn&#x27;t run at all.</li>
            <li>and I know exactly how they are.</li>
            <li>I first read about it on a make-up website I use and had been contemplating buying one for some time.</li>
            <li>It makes your makeup go on so smoothly and naturally.</li>
            <li>It does offer a more sheer coverage as opposed to a dense brush.</li>
            <li>so pretty</li>
            <li>but I guess nothing can,,,,,,,, Im still on my first sponge</li>
            <li>An absolute must for anyone who uses liquid foundation!</li>
            <li>First off, you don&#x27;t end up with powder all over your clothes, the bathroom floor, etc...</li>
            <li>It all ends up on your face, which I&#x27;m sure is saving me on powder and subsequently $$.&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li>but if you aren&#x27;t willing to experiment or learn then it might not be for you.</li>
            <li>First off this is a great price for what you get, much cheaper than Sephora where I usually purchase my beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>I really really like these!</li>
            <li>it goes on so smooth and looks natural.</li>
            <li>The beauty blender sponge is life changing for anyone who wants to contour and highlightlike a pro!</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and may never go back to using a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>The first one I&#x27;ve used up to 6 months</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing the cleaner</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these beauty blenders, I kept one for personal use and use the for clients.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I finally got my hands on these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most definitely never buy them again and post a video on my YouTube recommending them not.</li>
            <li>I bought two together still using on the first one</li>
            <li>really well!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more for my clients.</li>
            <li>so I am sure this will last me through the life of the sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it did the same job, maybe even better.</li>
            <li>I tried MANY cleansers, face washes, soaps, etc., and the only thing that worked was dish soap (saw this on another Amazon review)...</li>
            <li>Have tried this product many times before and actually bought this kit as a Christmas gift!  </li>
            <li>I dampen the sponge first and then use it to apply foundation.</li>
            <li>It started tearing apart while washing it for the first time.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that I couldn&#x27;t get the cleansing solution to come out of the bottle at all and had to screw off the top to use it.  </li>
            <li>However, since I still had the second one I thought I would give it one more chance.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to all the girls :))</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried the Blender sponge and feel like throwing away my make-up brushes.</li>
            <li>These are not fake</li>
            <li>they are the real deal!</li>
            <li>Well, the blender balls seemed ok from the outside</li>
            <li>When I saw these, with their nice egg shape and hot pink color, I thought I&#x27;d give them a shot, and they are wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I  have so many different type of foundation brushes but</li>
            <li>but other then that i love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought from sephora before and they are the exact same ones at a better price.</li>
            <li>I REAL beautyblender will not be like this!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This one is longer, does not become as fluffy, and therefore it doesn&#x27;t work as good...</li>
            <li>cleanser is amazing, and gets the foundation right out, so the sponge stays a nice bright pink and never feels dirty.</li>
            <li>It does a fine job of cleansing the blender of all makeup and oil residue so that it&#x27;s fresh for next time.</li>
            <li>I was super hesitant to spend this amount of money on a sponge, but I needed new brushes anyway and after watching youtube reviews, I decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s used wet and easy to clean after each client with access to water terminal of some sort.</li>
            <li>I switched back to my stippling brush which honestly, did a better job and used less foundation.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant to spend this kind of money for the Beauty Blender because there are so many similar products that cost waaay less.</li>
            <li>and when o used it, it used more product then my brush or hand and really had to same look afterwards.</li>
            <li>It makes my foundation more natural and soft.</li>
            <li>my blenders also last me a good 6 months with proper care.</li>
            <li>the soap pump is probably only good enough for 1 of the eggs</li>
            <li>So where a blender application was taking 2-3 full pumps of Missha BB Cream, finger application was taking under 1 full pump and getting the same level of coverage.</li>
            <li>Price is kinda high, but definately worth it.  </li>
            <li>, however you want to make sure that you don&#x27;t use too much and dry out your Beautyblender, so think of it more as spot cleaning than trying to soak the entire thing in soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping is much appreciated!  </li>
            <li>water-based foundation, which matches my skin perfectly and goes on extremely light (it also smells faintly of rosewater, making it extra</li>
            <li>It never leaves any lines or streaks, to clean wait for it to be completely dry then clean with the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was a little leery at first spending so much on a &#x27;sponge&#x27; but this is so SO much better than a sponge!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it was that easy, so I went to check it out in a variety of different lighting, convinced that there must be some streak or blob somewhere</li>
            <li>I set it on top of my muji makeup drawers and just pop it in there to dry after I use/wash it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the blender wet first, then squeeze it out, before applying foundation.  </li>
            <li>I was using the pedestal that comes with it to dry the blender on top of as a way to push out the cleanser</li>
            <li>I find it works better when the beauty blender is completely dry</li>
            <li>The knock offs don&#x27;t last nearly as long and don&#x27;t do as good a job.</li>
            <li>, it was a good buy considered the price of how much they usually are .</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t beat this price when a single beautyblender sells for $20 at sephora :)</li>
            <li>My large pores and acne are concealed after applying any liquid foundation with the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>but I also makes it last longer, the cleaner doesn&#x27;t clean as well as I expected but in overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>To use the dispenser you&#x27;re supposed to push the blender onto the top, but the liquid doesn&#x27;t really get absorbed and ends up squirting down the side of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The  Beauty Blender really blends out your foundation quick and seamlessly.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best beauty tool that I have purchased in the last ten years.</li>
            <li>in all I see this as a great product for those who are professionals or everyday people who enjoy a light natural coverage with very little effort.</li>
            <li>In a well ventilated place, it&#x27;s all right, but it&#x27;s good to keep in mind that you don&#x27;t want it to stay wet too long, or it will mildew.</li>
            <li>I used it and it was fine no big deal.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m usually don&#x27;t wear make up... but the first time i used this...i&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li>I love using these on my dry skin!</li>
            <li>This actually cleans my brushes and the blender so quickly and thoroughly!</li>
            <li>This little make up sponge is amazing.</li>
            <li>Have been loving the beautyblender, it does seem to add a little bit of time to my makeup schedule</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s true that it won&#x27;t suck up all your foundation-when I clean it minimal amounts of product are washed away.  </li>
            <li>But after wetting one and using it for the first time, WOW!!</li>
            <li>It takes out all the makeup and turns the sponge back to its bright pink color.</li>
            <li>While I was apprehensive about spending so much on sponges, I really don&#x27;t like liquid foundation much.  </li>
            <li>You need to get the real ones.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was ready to post this review then and there, but decided to try out the cleanser</li>
            <li>really like the cleanser that comes with the BeautyBlender too.</li>
            <li>That said, I really like this sponge.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>-Very</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need that much foundation  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like that.</li>
            <li>My friend was using her REAL beauty blender from sephora on me...</li>
            <li>the real one does.</li>
            <li>Yes, these are the real deal.</li>
            <li>P.S. Shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>, i really recommend this to anyone with a budget.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast and I&#x27;m amazed how well the product works</li>
            <li>Soo much hype over these beauty blenders</li>
            <li>I refused to buy it and only bought the look-a-like cheap kinds.</li>
            <li>About the beauty blender itself, I do not need it as much anymore.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t hold a candle to the real deal.</li>
            <li>it really helps blend and even all of my makeup.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind so much when it&#x27;s time to throw it away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to get the coverage</li>
            <li>and it is very helpful</li>
            <li>I wont say much because this product speaks for itself.</li>
            <li>So this sponge didn&#x27;t really make a difference.     </li>
            <li>To me that&#x27;s just too much work.</li>
            <li>Because the foam is so dense, it doesn&#x27;t soak up tons of foundation like some sponges do, and it applies it very evenly.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need a cleanser- 2 dollar baby shampoo works just as well.</li>
            <li>I like the sponges, they do work really well in foundation application.</li>
            <li>But I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the cheaper imitations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d absolutely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li>I really like the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>The hype is for real.</li>
            <li>I really don;t like it.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to test it out so lets save me some gas</li>
            <li>And it came fast.</li>
            <li>product was real and as described.</li>
            <li>So this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product !</li>
            <li>I think one is the real thing</li>
            <li>They soak up way too much product.</li>
            <li>sponge really blew me away.  </li>
            <li>It really cleaned up all the \\&quot;life\\&quot; problems on my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is alot of cleanser, it doesnt take too much</li>
            <li>Works better when the sponge is wet.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried the Beautyblender and are thinking about it, I highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li>It wears out really fast (2 wks</li>
            <li>Very versatile applicator.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleanser dispenser isn&#x27;t very functional.</li>
            <li>I really do like the cleanser.</li>
            <li>It really cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li>not with this beauty blender it makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li>Very flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have seen lots of reviews that say &amp;#34;used so much product&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see why this item costs so much.</li>
            <li>and it didn’t seem to make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it too often because I don&#x27;t hav a lot of time to get ready in the morning..</li>
            <li>The cleanser works really well for the beauty blenders as well as my brushes.  </li>
            <li>With this cleanser, it is so gentle and cleans the sponge easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I hadn&#x27;t caved and bought the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really ify about buying this out of fear</li>
            <li>For years I have heard the raves on youtube about the beauty blender, and I wasn&#x27;t ready to put out the money for one.</li>
            <li>The sponge really does blend my make up really well.</li>
            <li>Makes putting foundation on so much easier.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>These are real the real beautyblenders.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>as much</li>
            <li>you get the Beauty Blender, then you really have to get the blendercleanser.  </li>
            <li>The application and wash was so much easier than a brush too.</li>
            <li>These have made my foundation routine so much easier.</li>
            <li>I was wasting so much makeup every day.  </li>
            <li>have only washed one of the blenders once thus far, so I am not yet sure how they hold up over time.</li>
            <li>Seems that most stores are selling this product at or near the same price.</li>
            <li>I will not repurchase, kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I hate the feel of makeup, so the beauty blender is perfect for light and even applications.</li>
            <li>this is far superior to any round makeup sponge you can buy at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>This provides a nice finish to my liquid foundation, but not a huge difference from just using my fingers.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t clean them every single day, I&#x27;m sure to be left with blemishes.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and soft to the touch, and does not give me that cringe-y feeling I normally get when touching typical foam.</li>
            <li>and when you finally try, you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s very worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Everyone and I mean everyone had nothing but good things to say about the Beautyblender</li>
            <li>The one that I feel to be &amp;#34;the real beauty blender&amp;#34; feels better and cleans easier than the other.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was trying to clean out the very tip.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, fantastic sponge!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it came to my door that I ripped open the box, tossed my RT sponge, and took off the makeup I was wearing</li>
            <li>Also once I dampened the sponge it felt different, and a lot tougher than my original beauty blunders.</li>
            <li>Not everything you buy on the internet is authentic and I&#x27;m upset because that was $25 spent!</li>
            <li>But other than that, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Work better than any other sponge I have tried.</li>
            <li>These are not the original beauty blenders, they are a slightly different shape and texture.</li>
            <li>It makes applying foundation a breeze, better than any other way I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Take one with you and keep the other safe at home.&lt;br /&gt;Washable, re-useable, recyclable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually saving money because the Beautyblender applies the make up evenly and it&#x27;s unique shape gets into the curves and contours of my face.</li>
            <li>Soap is great just a little drop goes a long way for cleaning product.</li>
            <li>I have read MANY reviews of this happening with ColorStay with other people as well,</li>
            <li>They were also smaller than the original.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean well well when the make up is still wet on the sponge right after you use it, so</li>
            <li>Recommended to clean with massaging only fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>comments go mainly to the cleanser, which works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever cleaned my makeup brushes with whatever shampoo and soap I had laying around, even the tried and true baby shampoo, but this cleanser has changed my world and has made life so much easier..</li>
            <li>and they never left totally clean though</li>
            <li>Clean enough though.</li>
            <li>I like to wet the sponge first to get a light amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>One \\&quot;swoosh\\&quot; of the sponge in the basin, per the instructions, is never enough to clean the sponge.</li>
            <li>If I had to say one negative thing it would be that I use more foundation now, but that&#x27;s true of any sponge.</li>
            <li>I recommend it, even if it is just to clean your current brushes.</li>
            <li>I had tried a similar sponge in design without knowing how to use it appropriately or clean it.</li>
            <li>I think you end up using a little bit more with beauty blenders than brushes, but I think it is easier to get a more natural sheer look with these beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>Then I would take my foundation brush and smear foundation all over my face, blend a little with a knock off blender or a kabuki brush, then I would put a super light concealer under my eyes and contour the rest of my face then blend again either with a kabuki brush or the knock off brushes.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re totally worth the money, and the little plastic container they come in makes it easy to pack for travel as well.</li>
            <li>And it blows me away that a sponge needs a special cleaner, albeit it can also wash your brushes, but it literally smells like the same brush cleaner CVS brand $5.</li>
            <li>So I only used my on special occasion .</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant to buy this since it is a bit pricey, but it is definitely leaps and bounds better than the regular make up sponges.</li>
            <li>This is my first review, but I was so pleasantly surprised by how well this product works that I had to leave some feedback.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are very, very expensive but this sponge did allow me to accomplish the best application of foundation ever.</li>
            <li>I just add a couple squirts of the cleanser into a small bucket of warm water, swish all the brushes around and leave them in there to soak for 30-45 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this with MAC full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall great foundation/concealer/blender tool, as long as not on a very tight budget.</li>
            <li>this little pink tear drop of joy has changed my makeup routine.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li>They really get cleaned in less washes than normally, and they are truly clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I clean mine after every use and use the cleaner very sparingly, it goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I feel like I get more coverage with less product.</li>
            <li>I find I use less product and get a better finish.</li>
            <li>if purchasing from amazon, as it&#x27;s a better value, and you&#x27;ll have an extra one for travel, or to alternate between the sponges if you don&#x27;t feel like cleaning them all the time!</li>
            <li>Classic sponge.</li>
            <li>When I use my fingers, my foundation ends up looking caked on, my skin feels greasy, and I look about 10 years older.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product its something i can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and \\&quot;bouncy\\&quot; and I think it applies my liquid foundation very well.</li>
            <li>I wash mine before every single use-which is really important because it does soak up foundation and will lock it in, causing stains and bacteria.</li>
            <li>I think it is high.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of high end brushes</li>
            <li>I value Amazon&#x27;s reviews highly and also sent this as a gift to my aunt and mother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of high quality foundation brushes (spending a LOT of money) - and they are ALL inferior compared to this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product is highly over rated</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>id highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>from the high end make sponges to the target ones to the dollar store ones...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended.</li>
            <li>They are amazing for not only blending, but also contouring due to the pointy and blunt sides.</li>
            <li>There is a reason why magazines, makeup artists, YouTube beauty gurus and regular folks are raving about the beauty blender...because it actually delivers what it promises...beautifully blended foundation that is actually easy to do and rather a fast task to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to let the blender air dry completely (the package has a clear plastic stand to use), or else the blender can and will grow mold (friend&#x27;s experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was super skeptical about all the rave reviews our there about this product, but I am happy to say that this item actually lives up to the hype!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more involved</li>
            <li>I also like the packaging since there is a sperator in the container that allows me to keep the un-used sponge on the bottom and the one I am using on the top, it also has a little lid for the container.  </li>
            <li>The more I&#x27;ve used it little pieces of the sponge break off.</li>
            <li>However, I waited on writing this review because I wanted to have a little more \\&quot;blending time\\&quot; under my belt.</li>
            <li>Remember to spray the little sponge with a bit of water or makeup staying product and you&#x27;ll get even better results.</li>
            <li>I had only previously used either my fingers (pretty uneven application, and it would kind of sit on top of my face and look pretty gross), or a foundation brush (even application, but you had to use a lot</li>
            <li>These little sponges wear so well, give you a flawless and airbrushed finish for your makeup, and ultimately cause you to use less product as well!</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much (but something to consider if you have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, blends makeup very evenly &amp; leaves an airbrush finish.</li>
            <li>Just what a young woman wants fior beauty.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on very evenly and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I spent years as a makeup artist working at Sephora, and I was given free products all the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the beauty blender for a couple months, and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t clean it until it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if it is really worth the $$$ you can find similar sponges that work just as well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over a few days of experimenting I found that swiping it on produces a more even result than blotting it on.  </li>
            <li>and that takes suuuuper long especially if you have a handful of brushes, and sometimes we might have to dip them in soap twice or more.</li>
            <li>It is worth it and is actually cheaper.</li>
            <li>Just buy it, its worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Some items are worth paying extra!</li>
            <li>good stuff, just the box is poor packaged, and the liquid leak all over the box when I got it.</li>
            <li>Put the blendercleanser on a dry sponge (I clean it right before I need to use it again the next morning) and massage the cleanser in.  </li>
            <li>Love this blender cuts my make up time in half!</li>
            <li>Takes me less time to put on my foundation and looks more natural.</li>
            <li>Yes it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but you have to take more time with it, dampening it before use, applying makeup, then cleansing it and putting it to dry for the next use.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS BEAUTY BLENDER especially when I have dry skin bc</li>
            <li>The double pack and cleanser was priced just right.  </li>
            <li>If you have acne, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money, no matter how hard I try to get a good full coverage using the beauty blender, it just doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I did not realize  they were giving such a large bottle of the cleanser (5 fl oz).</li>
            <li>First reason is the obvious high cost of the blenders.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>so before i get anything new</li>
            <li>I asked if she had new makeup, what she was doing</li>
            <li>I use these sponges every day--they really do live up to the hype and price.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m always on the look out for new ways to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>I always thought it was a foundation problem and kept trying new ones, with no luck.</li>
            <li>and my cleanser looked BRAND NEW.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without a BB</li>
            <li>They asked me if I was using a new foundation, or a new face wash.</li>
            <li>I told them about the beauty blender and that that was the new product I was using.</li>
            <li>will say that this buy makes more sense for makeup geeks that have a daily contour and cat eye routine rather than those that are less intense about their beauty routine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely wet the sponge before using and clean after every use.</li>
            <li>It is harder to clean it when the sponge is wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makeup and pink dye will coat your sink when you clean the sponges.</li>
            <li>My blender still got stained and the pink fades though it is clean.</li>
            <li>I had to do multiple rounds of soaping and lathering before I could get the sponge to a point where I&#x27;d be comfortable using it again the next day...</li>
            <li>I do not see much of a difference between this and Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge (it&#x27;s only $6!!!)</li>
            <li>You use minimal amount of makeup and you are able to spread it evently across your entire face.</li>
            <li>I love these lil too big pink spongies.</li>
            <li>It makes my makeup application process so much faster, the large end of the sponge lets me quickly blend my whole face and the smaller pointy end is helpful for using around my nose and for covering up my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this little sponge!  </li>
            <li>Not sure that these do any better than any other smooth, make-up sponge.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much (about the size of a dime, which is what is dispensed if you use the bottle as directed) if you are cleaning your sponge on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>It makes my makeup look very natural-</li>
            <li>It is a very soft foam</li>
            <li>Very, very natural finish.</li>
            <li>I find that after using the beauty blender for my foundation and concealer, I look very natural, almost as though I didn&#x27;t even put any makeup on.</li>
            <li>love the sponges love the cleaner, hate the price, really makes your makeup look pretty though.</li>
            <li>I was a little iffy about spending this much on a makeup sponge, but it was definitely worth the splurge!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I usually order from Sephora, but this was a better deal.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>When I initially washed it the first time, some color rinsed out, however, that didn&#x27;t affect its job nor did the color fade, so I wasn&#x27;t bothered with that.</li>
            <li>But I compared this to the beauty blender I bought from Sephora and they are the exact same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The way I prefer using these is to first apply foundation all around my face with regular foundation brush without bothering to blend it out.</li>
            <li>and it looks natural!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The one from Sephora seems to be the exact same as the one I bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So minus those two issues i mentioned (which are kind of big especially for the price i paid</li>
            <li>remember during the first week doing double takes when I saw myself in a mirror.</li>
            <li>The stains from my brushes that I thought were permanent from foundations, lip colors, eye creams or concealers have all been completely washed away!</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in trying beauty blenders or who just want to stock up.</li>
            <li>The blender was easy to use and definitely should be used in it&#x27;s \\&quot;wet\\&quot; application form vs. dry.</li>
            <li>I use the cleaning wash to clean ALL my brushes and love the faint lavender smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the BB thins out product to look a step down from what it should (med cov items look like light cov and so forth).</li>
            <li>also use this cleanser to clean all of my other makeup</li>
            <li>I tried cleaning the Beautyblender with other cheaper products and it just didn&#x27;t &#x27;come clean&#x27; as well as when I used the cleanser.</li>
            <li>But it does it&#x27;s job extremely well, and I also use it to clean my brushes.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dye coming out of the sponge, though the cleaner doesn&#x27;t 100% get the sponge clean.</li>
            <li>What I thought was clean was not really quite so!</li>
            <li>Although generally I wouldn&#x27;t buy cleanser this expensive, I am happy that I have it.</li>
            <li>It gives me a smooth and airbrush finish in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I think I will refill the empty container with a mild liquid soap.</li>
            <li>I had not washed my Blender in a few days, and I used the cleanser for the first time today... and with 3-4 pumps of the cleanser, plus a little warm water-</li>
            <li>The cleanser has a nice mild lavender scent which I was afraid would be too strong, but it&#x27;s pretty subtle.</li>
            <li>The makeup looked so much more professional compared to the quality of my previous applications using a regular sponge, brush or my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Clean after EACH use and allow to air dry or your sponge will become moldy and cause breakouts!  </li>
            <li>I just recently purchased the pure sponge as well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever have a problem getting my powder on smoothly anyway; it&#x27;s always been the foundation that has given me a little bit of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They last a while as long as you take care and clean it after every use.</li>
            <li>and I agree that it is best to do very thin layers and let it dry and then add another layer, if necessary.</li>
            <li>I mean vivid bright pink water shouldn&#x27;t be coming out as I rinse it, unless that&#x27;s the color makeup I applied.    </li>
            <li>I mean, yeah, it&#x27;s a cool sponge but not that much better than other copies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen tutorials apply directly to the BB and in all my experiments the BB eats up some of the product.</li>
            <li>the all mineral \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; action tends to buff away any concealing effect and defeat the purpose.</li>
            <li>It seems designed to keep the product on the outside, so you don&#x27;t lose as much foundation (and $$$) by having it sucked into a sponge.     </li>
            <li>It can give anyone professional-looking results, even if you&#x27;re like me and are far from being considered a makeup artist.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft and squishy and I can&#x27;t wait to use them 😊</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all ready for the next use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely different size, texture and results to the real thing.</li>
            <li>Gives a natural look</li>
            <li>so I did so far</li>
            <li>The sponge is soft and the cleaner works well.</li>
            <li>so professional makeup artists give his a 10 star rate.</li>
            <li>I tried to buy a generic sponge and its NOTHING compared to the real product.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser gets all the makeup out completely every time.</li>
            <li>As long as Beautyblender&#x27;s in business, I&#x27;ll be supporting them.</li>
            <li>but my friend&lt;br /&gt;says it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the makeup from the Beautyblender.</li>
            <li>but I really dislike the price of these sponges I did see a generic brand in the store for about $2</li>
            <li>My makeup routine has been COMPLETELY transformed by this tool.</li>
            <li>I already owned a beauty blender in which it was getting old and need cleaned</li>
            <li>So far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it might be great for liquid foundation application the blender is just the wrong tool for BB Creams; and BB Creams are turning out to be far better than foundation, making the blender an unnecessary tool.</li>
            <li>Makes application seamless .</li>
            <li>As much as it&#x27;s raved about, for what this costs I&#x27;d rather just use knockoffs or basic sponges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these before, but I purchased them from a big brand beauty store and paid almost twice as much to get each product separately.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Off brands are not as soft.</li>
            <li>Wish I had not wasted time/ money on dupes....</li>
            <li>I use the tiny end to apply my spot concealer, and the rounded end to apply a finishing powder (which also blends it much nicer than my kabuki brush</li>
            <li>After hearing so much about them, I finally gave in a decided to see if Beauty Blenders are all they’re cracked up to be.</li>
            <li>how much foundation you&#x27;ll actually need which shouldn&#x27;t be a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that cleaning the sponge daily really helps extend it&#x27;s life, so finding a deal with two blenders, plus a generous bottle of the cleaner was a win-win.  </li>
            <li>I have bought several before from sephora, but Amazon shipped so much faster.</li>
            <li>same of pic..just the taxes was so much</li>
            <li>I find that the beautyblender really speeds up the process of putting on foundation if you only use one layer.</li>
            <li>Makes the second layer really cakey.</li>
            <li>and I agree the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; way is far better.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Why, because this sponge does not waste any makeup.</li>
            <li>When it is my current BBs time to go, I will probably only re-buy if on sale, since I’d rather not drop a ton of money on a sponge that might fall apart right away.</li>
            <li>The kit is extremely convenient and I recommend it highly for those purchasing this tool for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shape of it is also great, it allows you to use various angles to target large, small or hard to get to areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hands down favorite use for this is to apply loose powder</li>
            <li>I am not sure if one of these is supposed to be travel sized, and one full size, but they appear to be the same exact size.</li>
            <li>Beautyblender is a great tool, the cleanser gets dirty really easily and sometimes hard to pump.</li>
            <li>The cleanser sits opposite of my hand soap in my bathroom and the blender is typically always on top of the pedestal inside of the cleanser drying from when I cleaned it last.</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering them, i lost my first ine, also i havent used the cleaner before but decided to order it because my last one i didnt like how it felt after cleaning it with soap...i will update</li>
            <li>My only problem is that one of them ripped a tiny bit in the first week I bought it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, last a very long time</li>
            <li>I noticed that a few people complained about the pink dye washing off onto their skin, but I am very fair complected and this never happened to me.</li>
            <li>In addition, they consistently discharge pink ink every time you wet them, no matter how many times you wash they still discharge pink dye, which is totally gross.</li>
            <li>I read on another review that sometimes it is easier to clean the Blender if you let it dry after you apply makeup, and wash it later in the day/the next morning.</li>
            <li>and I think I prefer to wet the sponge first, but either way works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like getting them wet first because the foundation goes on a lot smoother.</li>
            <li>By getting it wet first the makeup does not soak into the sponge.</li>
            <li>These sponges make it very easy to get even coverage using a minimal amount of product in a fraction of the time it took me to apply foundation in the past.</li>
            <li>This beauty sponge is much more durable than any other that I had previously used.  </li>
            <li>After about 1-2 more weeks of use they both split in same place where hard spot formed.</li>
            <li>Say goodby to those ugly, dark under-eye circles because with the Beauty Blender &amp; your favorite concealer, you won&#x27;t see them any more!</li>
            <li>so I switched back to Sue Devitt and now it&#x27;s like brand new after every wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought the dispenser would be easy to use but it is awkward to get the amount out that you want, and the dispenser gets makeup all over it from whatever sponge you are trying to clean.</li>
            <li>i dint see much benefit from it dry.</li>
            <li>I use one wet for overall coverage, and then use the dry one to dab a bit extra under my eyes or anywhere else that needs a bit more attention.</li>
            <li>It is worth it alone in how much less foundation</li>
            <li>it make my foundation look soo professional and natural on face like the celebrities on red carpet</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s super easy to get into small corners around your nose/eyes with the small end.</li>
            <li>and I love the soft, lavender scent it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>no other sponges compare.</li>
            <li>The Beauty Blender is like no other make-up sponge you will ever use.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no other product in my routine to use the blender on</li>
            <li>and yes I&#x27;ve tried dupes but there is no other sponge out there like this one.</li>
            <li>BUT this sponge is like no other.  </li>
            <li>I wash it right before my next use since its used wet anyway.</li>
            <li>The sponge&#x27;s shape is easy to use: you can cover large areas fast + get into small delicate areas, like under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer mineral makeup to liquid, and the only way I&#x27;ve found to get adequate coverage is to start with a thick creme concealer (like dermablend) on the blemishes, then go over my whole face with a mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>Quality is as expected, very high.</li>
            <li>While a little expensive, the Beautyblender offers great coverage for makeup.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes but low expectations, as they seemed pretty gimmicky.</li>
            <li>I mean, you&#x27;re getting along just fine with your brushes and fingers,</li>
            <li>Idk how they do it, but the sponge isnt a regular sponge, It feels and works professionally.</li>
            <li>As suggested, I wet the Beautyblender, squeeze out the excess water in my hands then gently in a towel.</li>
            <li>I ended up washing the blender 3 times, then used my regular brush cleanser to get everything completely off.</li>
            <li>As long as you take a brief moment to learn the proper technique for using the sponge, it&#x27;s pretty fool-proof.</li>
            <li>But so far it has been doing the same thing for me.</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t shown any sign up wear or tear, and they&#x27;ve barely faded.</li>
            <li>Give me such a natural look.</li>
            <li>A must have in your personal and professional make up kit.</li>
            <li>I used to use either a brush or one of those old school white sponges, but I will always go to my beauty blender from here on out.</li>
            <li>I have been using Revlon ColorStay Foundation which completely and totally stains BB</li>
            <li>After you have applied your makeup and are set and ready to go wet the sponge again and rinse it then go over your face again</li>
            <li>They did arrive on time but the liquid was not closed</li>
            <li>and I just recently has to repurchase because it was getting old and tattered up.</li>
            <li>Definitely a must have in any makeup kit, professional or not.</li>
            <li>The blender did bleed some pink colour during the first several washings, but It never bled on my face during</li>
            <li>First of all the 2 sponges were different shades of pink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I agree with all the hype about this, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I have not had the problem that some other customers have had with the pink dye &#x27;running&#x27; when I wash it, and the cleanser seemed to clean the sponge well.</li>
            <li>I get even coverage and no little hairs from my brushes now that I use the blender only.</li>
            <li>So if you decide to use these, expect the small bottles of foundation to last less amount of time than normally, and hence more burden on your pockets.&lt;br</li>
            <li>kit comes in a small, clear, rectangle box with the beauty blender packaging in the circle container as shown and the cleanser right along side of it.</li>
            <li>Just let it dry and wash it before bed, and it will be ready for use the next day.</li>
            <li>I paid $19.99 for my first Blender alone, and for $30 some odd bucks, I got 2 Blenders and the cleaner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You do need the cleanser to clean, if not the sponge gets hard</li>
            <li>I get really oily that it was very minimal to when I use to apply with a brush.</li>
            <li>- at least it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the brown color, but I am assuming it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>one blender seems different than the other but both work the exact same so no complaints!</li>
            <li>I was a little weary at first</li>
            <li>It smells a little funny</li>
            <li>Using the sponges makes make-up go on so smoothly, and you use so little of the product compared to other modes.</li>
            <li>bought the single at first and then the double so I can have one dry, one damp and for powder.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d been eying it for months, but not sure it was worth the price.)    </li>
            <li>When I first tried them out, I was infatuated.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t give up if the first few time you use it you find the finish is not what you want.</li>
            <li>I was being very gentle and don’t have very long or sharp nails that it could get caught on or anything.</li>
            <li>so i have to use a little more foundation then usual.</li>
            <li>My fav is MAC full coverage cream foundation, I use LESS with a wet beauty blender than a brush or regular sponge.</li>
            <li>Makes blending a breeze, no more noticeable line around my face if my shade isn&#x27;t exactly right.</li>
            <li>Let it dry completely before u wash it &amp; it will not stain.</li>
            <li>You get a pretty generous sized bottle, the only downside being the dispensing tip, as it tends to waste a bit of product</li>
            <li>It did take a few tries before I figured out exactly how wet the sponge should be and how much makeup was needed.</li>
            <li>It is just a little difficult to clean it, but the blendercleanser does a better job than the other regular cleansers I used to use before purchasing this combo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been absolutely amazed at the results I&#x27;ve gotten from this little sponge.</li>
            <li>I have been absolutely amazed at the results I&#x27;ve gotten from this little sponge.</li>
            <li>The price may be a little steep, but it&#x27;s a very well-made product that won&#x27;t just fall apart.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, this was recommended in a beauty book I read and after reading all the reviews I hesitantly bought this, (the price just seems steep for a little sponge (or two) , but.....</li>
            <li>Fast shipping but a little pricey for this thing</li>
            <li>I kept thinking that surely this little pink sponge couldn&#x27;t be THAT great, and I thought the price seemed a little crazy for just a simple little sponge and some cleanser.</li>
            <li>I probably used half as much product as usual, and there wasn&#x27;t a huge powdery mess on the table.</li>

            <li> The cleaner is easy to use and smells great.</li>
            <li> The beauty blender soap is great, it doesnt leave or have a strong scent and cleans my beauty blenders without leaving any residue of foundation.</li>
            <li> Very excited!</li>
            <li> Sponge itself is amazing - my fave for even makeup application.</li>
            <li> All i can say its an amazing product.</li>
            <li> amazing for applying make up</li>
            <li> I use it with my foundation stick and it delivers amazing results.  </li>
            <li> but this is an amazing tool to have in your beauty arsenal.  </li>
            <li> is an amazing product i makes my makeup look</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to applying makeup with brushes or cheap sponges.  </li>
            <li> but it cleans the beauty blender and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is one amazing blender sponge</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, the item is amazing.</li>
            <li> The cleaner is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> I use either Bobbi Brown or Amazing Cosmetics (both are dense creams).</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> do not even think about it, the blender is amazing</li>
            <li> The Beauty Blender is amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> They work amazingly.</li>
            <li> These sponges are amazing.</li>
            <li> the cleanser is amazing.</li>
            <li> Works really good love it👍</li>
            <li> how effectively it blended foundations, concealer and creams.</li>
            <li> It does not cake up and it blends out so nicely with this sponge.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because honestly, I have no idea how to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> This product honestly revolutionized the way I do my makeup.</li>
            <li> But it is kind of a hassle and in my opinion, overpriced.</li>
            <li> This sponge is spectacular - I am amazed by it.  </li>
            <li> Girls who still don&#x27;t own it they have to.</li>
            <li> wors great makeup goes on flawless and even will definatly buy another one in the future bought one for my mom also</li>
            <li> It really blends in the makeup perfectly!</li>
            <li> Best make up applicator, it really doesn&#x27;t compare with others in the market.</li>
            <li> but it is kind of pricey</li>
            <li> and I tried cleaning it on my own shampoo</li>
            <li> Or anyone that wants a dewy perfect foundation or powder!</li>
            <li> The sponge makes applying foundation so much nicer than a brush and practically makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> and they have held up nicely.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is really nice</li>
            <li> (and the cleanser does smell really nice )</li>
            <li> cleanser is a nice size (5 oz.)</li>
            <li> The shape of these sponges is perfect for the application of makeup, but I always tend to end up with too much makeup on when I use it.</li>
            <li> But, the cleanser is nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice scent, smells like lavender and tea tree.</li>
            <li> However, I can see the packaging being a nice storage place for everything too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if your own brush cleanser or baby shampoo would work just as well.  </li>
            <li> but it just works so nice...</li>
            <li> It is good and convenient, but not as magical as they hype seemed to be.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t tell if its entirely effective because the color is still on my sponge</li>
            <li> The absolute best way to apply product on your face!</li>
            <li> Heard all the good things about it and glad I bought the blender and cleaner pack</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this item out since I heard great things about it.</li>
            <li> i like it very much, this is a very good one that i chose .</li>
            <li> On a side note, the cleanser works great to clean brushes too.</li>
            <li> Best investment and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love that is comes with 2 beauty blenders and a soap always have loved beauty blenders and this is a very good deal and fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money and helps blend make up beautifully.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase, love the scent of the soap</li>
            <li> The Blender is the best makeup sponge I have ever used (read all the reviews of the Blender if you want more details on that), and the cleanser is definitely worth the money. :)</li>
            <li> I feel like it does a great job of filling in the pores to give a more smooth finish.</li>
            <li> the beauty blender is great for applying liquid foundation you have to use it wet for best results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly impressed, I never thought I&#x27;d love a sponge so much.</li>
            <li> The makeup comes out quickly and it smells great.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully and made my concealer/foundation look very natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This has many, many uses and will help you apply make up like a pro!</li>
            <li> i love this! :)</li>
            <li> I honestly like my brushes better.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still the best method I&#x27;ve found so far, since an all creme/liquid approach leaves me looking like a geisha and</li>
            <li> I still think the products are over priced, but I will buy them again because of the way it applies my makeup--darn near flawless.</li>
            <li> I really love this one makes my makeup look really nice</li>
            <li> This is far by the best beauty sponge out there</li>
            <li> Brushes, fingers,&lt;br /&gt;sponge wedges and the Beautyblender by far is the best!</li>
            <li> I was doubting this when I bought it, but wow it works great!</li>
            <li> The cleanser is amazing and of course I love the beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> Seems the easiest and most effective way.</li>
            <li> but when I use my BeautyBlender sponge my skin looks flawless but natural.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how well it cleans without the beauty blender cleanser, but the cleanser has a nice scent and seems to get most of the makeup out of the sponge.</li>
            <li> I love this handy tool.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best foundation application method on the market.</li>
            <li> Goes on beautifully and blends very well!</li>
            <li> Honestly, by far the best investment I&#x27;ve made when comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> The sponge is soft,  and just the perfect size so that it&#x27;s not bulky to hold.</li>
            <li> Love love love the beauty blender!</li>
            <li> Then, get it real nice and soaked and get all the soap out and all the color should come out and your sponge will look like new again!</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and pleasant.    </li>
            <li> Overall great purchase for a great price.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d feel about using BM with a damp applicator, but honestly, I think it works wayyyyyy better.</li>
            <li> It does a beautiful job covering acne scars and large pores.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend the sponges work incredibly well.</li>
            <li> the cleaner is also awesome as you can use it to clean all of your brushes not just the blender and its a large size cleaner as well.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really fast and beautiful application of foundation.</li>
            <li> Great item &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but the sponge doesn&#x27;t have the effect on my face as it did the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> it is very perfect and make it as it new again I strongly recommended</li>
            <li> was quick!!</li>
            <li> I apply my liquid foundations exclusively with beauty blenders as the provide a nice buildable application that is easy to control and does not leave seams or brush stroke lines that many brushes do.</li>
            <li> And very easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Like many people who wanted to save money, I opted for the knock off first, none ever did as good a job as the original!!</li>
            <li> The Beauty Blender makes it really easy and nice to apply foundation, and although I prefer using make-up remover and bar soap to clean brushes, the cleanser is really nice and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Beauty Blender, however this one broke (I didn&#x27;t think a sponge could break!)</li>
            <li> LOVE these!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> makeup blends so much better</li>

            <li> The flawless finish it creates is an extra bonus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an ok product.</li>
            <li> foundation goes on smooth and looks really natural, pointed end is great for under the eyes and around the nose!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the sponge for you if you feel that your make-up goes on that much better using one.  </li>
            <li> After having perfect skin for years, my face suddenly went berserk on me in my mid-twenties and nothing I&#x27;ve tried has stopped the breakouts or scarring.</li>
            <li> They are authentic and boy I was messing alot before I decided to buy them.</li>
            <li> They are magic blender .</li>
            <li> Love it , which I knew about this product sooner</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple minutes to have a flawless, airbrushed-looking foundation finish.</li>
            <li> I think on a cost-per-use basis, it&#x27;s actually an excellent deal and this product is definitely NOT a gimmick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even intend on trying one of those at all, because I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my BeautyBlender in every aspect.aning my BeautyBlender</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s shape, albeit simple, is wonderfully designed.</li>

            <li> and I love the light smell that it has!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried too many gimmicks...</li>
            <li> Most of it will get soaked up by the Beautyblender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> That saddened me, since I have mostly always used my fingertips for applying concealer.</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> SOAKS UP YOUR MAKEUP MORE THAN IT IS PUTTING ON YOUR FACE</li>

            <li> I just thought if I was going for it, I would go all out - and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> OMG I just love this product, it is so beyond to just a sponge..</li>
            <li> When I use this beauty blender it gives me much better coverage</li>
            <li> I love this sponge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this make up sponge.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t authentic.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> for the soap/shampoo, my favorite part about it is using it on my make up brushes.</li>
            <li> and i love the sponge.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I know most use it for foundation</li>

            <li> Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Im extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> It doesnt cake up makes u look fab :)</li>
            <li> I love the blender for applying my foundation.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought it</li>
            <li> I love beauty blenders and will continue to repurchase them until they&#x27;re no longer made.</li>
            <li> but I love the BB</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipping and great care</li>
            <li> and you get two applicators, more for the $$.</li>
            <li> Love this product helps with blending and contouring foundation</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than using a brush</li>
            <li> I was so glad.</li>
            <li> but so many people rave about it that I wanted to see what the buzz was all about..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than a brush</li>
            <li> but I found it just ok.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered.</li>
            <li> One more thing....if you use a foundation that has adjustable coverage by applying it twice in certain areas, you&#x27;ll probably find this sponge very effective in application.</li>
            <li> I first apply the foundation to my face with a large concealer brush then blend it with my damp beautyblender and it blends perfectly!</li>
            <li> Blends contour beautifully, giving a natural finish!</li>
            <li> It leaves an amazing clean finish.  </li>
            <li> I use it to clean my makeup brushes and it works effectively.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I love that it can be washed every single day, and I especially love that you can use it damp.</li>
            <li> First I used the pointy end to apply and blend the creme concealer with surprisingly good results.</li>
            <li> It makes it so beautiful and seamless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and easy!</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this deal!</li>
            <li> So easy to apply (just make sure sponge is damp), and apply in a bouncing/stippling motion.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re especially wonderful for people with dry skin because of the moisture being pressed into the skin with whichever product you choose to use on the blender.</li>
            <li> I perfect for my dry skin type.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned above, it&#x27;s done the best job at applying powder products for me by leaving a smooth and silky finish instead of a chalky looking one.  </li>
            <li> By simply bouncing the applicator on my face (stippling) the makeup is applied flawlessly without soaking into the sponge and my pores are nicely filled in.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin look naturally flawless, instead of making the foundation sit on top of it and get dry looking  -Very easy to use quickly  </li>
            <li> All time favorite love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nice and easy to use nothing special.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten about the BB completely until I came across this awesome deal right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> one of the sponges was loose in the box but still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Used the liquid cleaner on my cosmetic brushes and they came clean!</li>
            <li> I figured out how to get the beauty blender completely clean!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all clean!</li>
            <li> Subsequently, I used Dove body wash to clean the sponge and it works wonderfully with no  staining from the makeup.  </li>
            <li> My skin just looks so much more even and flawless (even though it is certainly NOT under the makeup)!</li>
            <li> All makeup guru will agree that beauty blenders are an important item in all makeup artist or collectors. :-)</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t explain why the BeautyBlender is the best foundation applicator I have found, because it makes absolutely no sense to me.  </li>
            <li> I started using the Real Techniques sponge and loved it.</li>
            <li> When you use it right, your skin looks amazing and airbrushed -</li>
            <li> I saw all the reviews at Youtube and it is amazing, you just should be carefull with the right care of the sponge</li>
            <li> Love the Beauty blender, helps blend in makeup so much better than a brush and with this cleanser, it is super easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> I purchased an authentic Original Beauty Blender from Sephora and I was looking to replace it.</li>
            <li> The  authentic Original Beauty Blender did not have these rings.</li>
            <li> I bought my beauty blenders back in March and have really loved them!</li>
            <li> It cleans the sponge easily.</li>
            <li> The BeautyBlender is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge, and this is such a great deal for two of them and the cleaner.</li>
            <li> makes my makeup application so easy.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as EASY as it&#x27;s made out to be.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use too.</li>
            <li> You can easily dab the product around creases by the nose, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SUCH a good deal to buy on Amazon and the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> This sponge is sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> if I used it for a lot that day than i have to clean it like that more than once</li>
            <li> Secondly, the cleanser is great but the packaging leaves more to be desired.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the complaints are about, the dispenser worked fine and the sponge cleaned up easily.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments and my makeup looks &amp;#34;flawless!&amp;#34; For the most part, I use them wet and the results are great.</li>
            <li> I first learned of the Beautyblender from reading Jessica Alba&#x27;s book, The Honest Life.</li>
            <li> say, one of them expanded into double its size beautifully.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best makeup sponge i have ever used, and being a pro makeup artist i have used allot!</li>
            <li> I am fine with my finger application</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s had been many, many months since I started using the first one..</li>
            <li> Although it takes a bit more time than my usual applicator, the Beautyblender leaves an incredible air brush like finish!</li>
            <li> The application is easy and the look is smooth.</li>
            <li> It is fine.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner seems fine</li>
            <li> With this wonderful little sponge, I can rest easy knowing I won&#x27;t get cake face or streak marks</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, and carry on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the container is great and offers a great way to dry the blenders.  </li>
            <li> The blender will grow in size and be a little damp, but works best this way.</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift for my daughter and she can&#x27;t say enough great things about how smoothly and evenly it applies makeup.</li>
            <li> Creates a smooth finish and is easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE skeptic when it comes to beauty tools.  </li>
            <li> It makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s made a HUGE difference...</li>
            <li> Contour queens may enjoy using this as well to blend in</li>
            <li> I definitely think that this product is a great investment</li>
            <li> such a great deal.</li>
            <li> do as instructed and have a smooth makeup look no smudge no nothing</li>
            <li> It is great for blending concealer, and especially for blending around areas like your nose or eyes.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic and the cleanser works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t pass it up, such a great deal.</li>
            <li> I was told you could use sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li> The sponge is easy to clean and the cleanser works on brushes too.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for liquid foundation and cream blushes.</li>
            <li> I use the sponge during my entire make up routine and it works great to blend foundation, bronzer, eyeshadows,</li>
            <li> It was smooth and all my pores were filled in with no streaks or edges.  </li>
            <li> such a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s velvety smooth</li>
            <li> was gonna order the cheap version</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s piece of mind knowing your applicator is bacterial free there</li>
            <li> its like getting the cleaner for free.  </li>
            <li> This is an all-in-one tool that is great for a air brushed finish!</li>
            <li> it allows your makeup to go on smoothly and without lines.  </li>
            <li> And the cleanser is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have used a Foundation Brush for years and thought nothing could beat the the look of my makeup, until a friend of mine came to visit that I had not seen in a couple of months and her face looked FANTASTIC--</li>
            <li> The cleaner that comes with them works amazingly and doesn&#x27;t take much at all to cleanse them.</li>
            <li> I have tried cleaning them with gentle soap, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as effective as the cleanser that comes with them.  </li>
            <li> and it went on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The sponge applicator is so easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> and it gives a smooth even appearance.  </li>
            <li> The sponges make for a smooth even application.</li>
            <li> I have been using the foundation brushes for awhile now, but it doesnt leave a smooth finish like the blender does.  </li>
            <li> It makes you makeup looking fresh for many hours.</li>
            <li> It is extremely easy to use the pump on the cleanser to clean off the sponge.</li>
            <li> I found that it helps a lot to use a light powder to set it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub on smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> I got two BB’s with the liquid cleanser for $30 which seemed like a great deal compared to what they sell for individually.</li>
            <li> The delivery was smooth and prompt.</li>
            <li> Great deal for 2 beauty blenders and the daily cleaner.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, my blender rarely sees the inside of the packaging it came in.</li>
            <li> enjoy the cleanser</li>
            <li> for the sponges, I think that they are made very well and having two comes in handy.</li>
            <li> The BeautyBlender is fantastic.</li>
            <li> And the sponges themselves are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars since I faithfully use the sponge everyday for flawless Lancome makeup application.</li>
            <li> The price is AMAZING for 2 AND cleaner..shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I just use the stipple effect and it feels light and airy.</li>
            <li> however I found it most useful for me to buff out my concealer with.</li>
            <li> Forget using those cheap sponges.</li>
            <li> Pricy, but useful, just not as magical as I thought it would be &#x27;cause</li>
            <li> It distributes your foundation throughout your whole face in a nice even layer.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and ever wondered how a sponge could make you look flawless, it really works!&lt;br /&gt;Rating only 4 starts because the sponge cleaner smells like ginger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a different foundation just because i&#x27;ve watched and read so many good reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> I already owned one Beauty Blender, and I bought this combo because I loved the first Blender that much!</li>
            <li> I was already a big fan of beauty blenders before - they really do give your skin a flawless &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li> Seller was authentic and shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li> Trying to wash it right after use is time-consuming and takes more effort.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it will fix that right up. :)</li>
            <li> I would think warm or hot water could certainly cause more color</li>
            <li> I would think warm or hot water could certainly cause more color loss.  </li>
            <li> THis is very worth the try</li>
            <li> When I first got them I thought they both felt very cheap and tried to google if this Amazon store sold me cheap knock-offs.</li>
            <li> I use much less of my product and the cleanser is nice as well with a pleasant herbal</li>
            <li> Every good thing I&#x27;ve ever heard about the beauty blender is completely 100% true</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t absorb all your makeup like sponges and cleanup is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> They leave a flawless finish with little effort , even when I&#x27;m in a hurry !</li>
            <li> but with this one is so fast, very easy</li>
            <li> My new best friend and now part of my daily makeup ritual.</li>
            <li> I even use the large end to apply blush, and then squeeze it to make it smaller for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product I still love using.</li>
            <li> I love love this sponge, I was very skeptical about the performance, but based on all the great reviews I decided to splurge and order it, and I am so glad I did, this not only makes my foundation look flawless</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> wrks great, makes my make up application super simple.</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean and affordable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soak up a huge amount of foundation like cheap sponges do, and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I originally read about it in a magazine, and pre-ordered it from amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Without a face primer, make up looks great and lasts for a long time (about 4 to 5 hours for me).</li>
            <li> im so excited on using the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I was soooo excited about these, thinking they were the holy grail of makeup application.</li>
            <li> It feels cool on my skin because it is damp and this may also be the reason why it does not soak up a lot makeup as the pores in the sponge are already filled with water.  </li>
            <li> artist friend convinced me to get the original</li>
            <li> Application is flawless, blended, and even, more so than my most expensive foundation brushes or sponges.</li>
            <li> When I soaked it (as you&#x27;re supposed to do before use), it &amp;#34;swelled&amp;#34; to the size of my original well used sponge.</li>
            <li> It also feels so fresh when applying make up!</li>
            <li> But it is not as travel friendly as a makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> your fun!</li>
            <li> and I have had so many compliments on my makeup just in the first week that I have been using it.</li>
            <li> this product is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited to use it.</li>
            <li> was converted to the beautyblender a long time ago and was so happy when I found this steal.</li>
            <li> when I first got the blender I tore some holes in the top from my nails.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s an original.</li>
            <li> It it original...</li>
            <li> They were totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> I had tried many other soaps before this one to clean my beauty blander but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Also it is a pain in the butt to keep all of those brushes clean.    </li>
            <li> I was sold, even used the pointy end to clean up an eye makeup oops without messing up my foundation.    </li>
            <li> Part of the reason it was so easy to clean is that the sponge absorbed almost no product, so everything was just on the surface.</li>
            <li> but I know it is clean when the water runs</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: The Beautyblender did begin to \\&quot;bleed pink\\&quot; soon after I posted my review, and does every time I clean it.  </li>
            <li> I also use it to clean my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> and I clean</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about bacteria in the sponge because you clean it with every use.</li>
            <li> I do clean it with the cleanser</li>
            <li> Had to re clean all my brushes to get that smell out.</li>
            <li> I clean my brushes every two weeks instead of waiting 2</li>
            <li> I swish them around again and just rinse them off by swishing them in the bucket with clean water once or twice</li>
            <li> It will clean your sponge..</li>
            <li> the pointed tip area of the sponge always comes clean.</li>
            <li> You can clean the sponge with something else.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think is something amazing, kinda expensive, but the cleanser is the best I ever used</li>
            <li> The foundation transfers from the BB to the pump, so you have to clean that up.</li>
            <li> and I will also use it to clean brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I clean my every day.</li>
            <li> - To be used to clean Beautyblender after every use.</li>
            <li> I had been using hand soap to clean it with.</li>
            <li> (Packaging is super important to me because I tend to repurpose it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Cleaning the blender is SUPER important.</li>
            <li> I was using soap to clean my sponges</li>
            <li> It seems to clean up easier that way.</li>
            <li> Clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t clean the makeup off the sponge.</li>
            <li> The skin ranged from mature to supple (the mother of the bride, the bride and her younger sisters) and the result for everyone was flawless airbrushed looking skin.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my brushes.</li>
            <li> love the fact that I can apply my concealer - still use a brush for that, but then use the sponge on top and what a natural blend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Somebody posted on here how to get it clean, but I will reiterate it:  </li>
            <li> You will need it to clean your sponge.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean that well</li>
            <li> It has a very light lavender fragrance and is gentle and soy-based.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on very smooth and it cleans up very well.  </li>
            <li> It is designed right, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is also fantastic, it cleans the sponge and its great on all my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I love how the BeautyBlender has the large end</li>
            <li> My routine before was I would put either a moisturizer or a primer, sometimes on special occasions</li>
            <li> I wanted to know what the hype was, and let me say that the hype is RIGHT!</li>
            <li> It makes the bristles clean, soft and smell nice.</li>
            <li> Make up sponges are available for fraction of the cost in the pharmacy, and I&#x27;m not saying they would do as good of a job, but for someone on tight budget that could be a much better option.  </li>
            <li> Not quite sure how long the sponge will remain effective  </li>
            <li> and I wash it after every use overall pretty happy with this product it</li>
            <li> After a couple of months of using it, I found that it absorbs so much of my foundation, hence not giving me full coverage, and I would have to use more foundation.</li>
            <li> Thought the deal was great but expected it to be the full size Beauty Blenders, not the minis.</li>
            <li> they are the authentic, real beautyblenders and they are</li>
            <li> but I also have better coverage since the sponge doesn&#x27;t absorb much product.</li>
            <li> It will get your beautyblender super clean AND it will prolong the life of your beautyblender..</li>
            <li> Save your money or buy the real thing from Sephora or a well known store because this is not the authentic product...</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and a must-have whether you are a make-up newbie or guru! :)</li>
            <li> I love the Beautyblender, it really blends the make up very well, leaves your face so smooth!</li>
            <li> brushes that need a good deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon:)</li>
            <li> The cleanser is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the sponges, not so much on the liquid.</li>
            <li> I get a much more airbrushed look without wasting too much product.</li>
            <li> just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey but for 2 and the cleaner such a good buy</li>
            <li> However, I love the smell of the cleanser so much that I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> After googling DIY cleanser (because this stuff ain&#x27;t cheap) I decided the Beauty Blender Cleanser was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry if I have a full coverage because the blender does the work for you.</li>
            <li> So, basically I paid double the price for one good piece.</li>
            <li> It makes coverage better and doesn&#x27;t use as much as I do when using a brush.</li>
            <li> And I like full coverage</li>
            <li> Love the beauty blender it really works.</li>
            <li> But I love the Beauty Blender so much I have not even opened the others.</li>
            <li> If it seems too good to be true its because it is... BIG DISSAPOINTMENT</li>
            <li> I am super fair skinned and Its a constant battle of finding the proper shade and application technique in order to make my face look good, not cakey.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product was exactly how it was described!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to dab for larger areas (you don&#x27;t want to drag your skin anyways) and the smaller pointy tip is great for under eye concealer and for even smudging eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use this with my foundation, concealer, cream blush, even my Bare Minerals powder, and it really blended everything nicely.</li>
            <li> The cleaner is great too, i also clean my brushes with it, takes lipstick and other oily products off like a dream!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve even quickly gone through a quarter of that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t take much at all to get the BeautyBlender clean again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m super paranoid that it will mold.</li>
            <li> So I looked on Amazon for cheaper prices and I got lucky and found this package deal.</li>
            <li> Super , I used when I put on my foundation</li>
            <li> I finally found a great color from Haba USA, but the foundation is a very runny liquid.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to clean with the cleanser, but dont use too much.</li>
            <li> Blends make up really well and easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t has this issue if I use mild hand soap or Clinique \\&quot;Take the Day Off\\&quot; Makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make sure I place my next order 2-3 wks after ordering a sponge to make sure I have a replacement.</li>
            <li> Ordering the double blender kit with the cleanser was such a great deal!</li>
            <li> and I hope to resolve this issue quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick tip:</li>
            <li> Luckily I happened to watch a beauty blogger on youtube</li>
            <li> I highly recommend :-)</li>
            <li> The price point is a little intimidating, but after having used it for a few months, I believe the excellent quality makes it a good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the BeautyBlender.. do not waste your money on &#x27;dupes&#x27; - none truly compare to the original..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normally a lot more for two sponges at Sephora and it doesn&#x27;t include the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo and though it smells better than the beauty blender cleanser, I now feel as though my blender and the brushes are thoroughly washed and cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s best to clean when it&#x27;s dry and start by massaging in the cleanser or the dry BB before adding water and massaging to clean.</li>
            <li> LOVE my new BB &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Even though they seemed like they would only be good to use with liquid foundation, I decided to try using them with the mineral foundation first just for the heck of it.</li>
            <li> I have good (but dry) skin, but I like how I can get things even with this</li>
            <li> I have fair, dry, and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all I&#x27;m very picky</li>
            <li> I enjoy cleaning them its pretty fun.</li>
            <li> It did about as good a job as those single use sponges you can get at any drugstore.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the beauty blender cleanser in the solid form is better!</li>
            <li> Already using the blender, I needed a new one and the price was great for a double set plus the cleaner.</li>
            <li> They apply makeup just as good as the cheap, old style wedge puffs you find at your local drug store for just couple bucks for a full bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cleanser is amazing too, it really does clean the beautyblenders better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> However, it does clean really well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, this is a great little tool to have.</li>
            <li> This is a great little kit to get you started with the Beautyblender sponges.  </li>
            <li> but you will see that if you let it go too long without a nice clean the effectiveness will go with it.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;dud&amp;#34; is more difficult to clean and doesn&#x27;t feel as great as the true beauty blender.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say that it would make a huge difference than using something gentle like baby wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also important to note to be considerably gentle.</li>
            <li> It made the foundation that I washed out look a bit bright pink.</li>
            <li> The cleaner is amazing for not only the beauty blender itself but even my brushes!!!</li>
            <li> The foundation does not go on smoothly as the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Also, both sponges have these rings around it as though a machine just freshly shaved them.</li>
            <li> The cleanser also so useful.</li>
            <li> Then, under warm water, just splash a tiny bit of water on it, and work it in.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> So worth it..</li>
            <li> or so keeps it fresh</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> so I use thick full coverage makeup- Mac studio fix - and it went on beautifully.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is not an economical way to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for ways to improve the application of my liquid foundation, so far my fingers have been my favorite form of application.</li>
            <li> my foundation looks way more natural</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the wash, it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup from the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny I paid..</li>
            <li> Totally worth</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite way to apply liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Then I use the Beautyblender to actually blend things out nicely.  </li>
            <li> I found that it does give more natural coverage than using brushes.</li>
            <li> But I love this product so far.</li>
            <li> but, it has been so worth it.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many sponges to blend my foundation ( I switch between a liquid and a mineral powder) so that it looks natural.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s worth it, though, in my opinion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also tried my own facial cleanser</li>
            <li> Using the blender, my skin looks dewy and fresh and I don&#x27;t need powder.  </li>
            <li> But I think I got one with the old flip top packaging instead of the pump</li>
            <li> and they seemed to have absorbed a lot of the foundation, but not with the beauty blender.  </li>
            <li> My entire face looked flawless and there wasn&#x27;t any lines or inconsistencies, everything just sort of spreads out evenly.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth it</li>
            <li> Worth the price??</li>
            <li> so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> So I let it sit for about 8 hours while I was at work, came home and started to rinse it and GENTLY massage the soap out and the whole thing started to fall apart!!!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this is hands down the best product to apply foundation, cream blush, concealer, and pretty much any other formula.</li>
            <li> It just takes a second to clean and well worth the extra step for great looking make up.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to clean and I like the cleanser, but I must admit that I use it with my Cetaphil daily cleanser to clean my sponges.</li>
            <li> $30 (or more) is a big investment for a set of makeup sponges, but the results are truly worth it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean (way easier than washing my foundation brush and waiting for it to dry).</li>
            <li> It shipped quick and was the real deal!</li>
            <li> I was SO reluctant to buy the cleanser because I was certain I could get it clean without it...</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it stains, so make sure you clean it often.</li>
            <li> Another reason to make sure to clean your blender regularly!  </li>
            <li> I do clean the bigger brushes in the palm of my hands before rinsing since they are more dense</li>
            <li> The only think i dont love is having to rub the sponge to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought the beautyblender due to all the good reviews on youtube.  </li>
            <li> I bought the original Beauty Blenders cheaper than here at Camera Ready Cosmetics website</li>
            <li> exactly as described and i am overall very satisfied with my purchase, thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this and highly recommend it for anyone who wants an airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> So I can literally wash it right before I use</li>
            <li> right? ..</li>
            <li> never quite looked right&#x27;</li>
            <li> They came right on time</li>
            <li> and then I apply the cleanser to my beauty blender with a tad bit of water and it takes the product right off.</li>
            <li> right so it spilled.</li>
            <li> I suppose any gentle body wash or makeup remover will clean it as well  </li>
            <li> Chantecaille&#x27;s cream-style Future Skin was excellent in texture but too dark for me, for example.    </li>
            <li> Overall, hands down, one of my best beauty purchases EVER!    </li>
            <li> This little sponge is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I find I get the best results when I clean the beautyblender after each use and let it completely air dry before the next use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product makes applying makeup so easy, and so natural appearing!  </li>
            <li> My makeup goes on perfectly every time, and I think it actually takes me LESS time using this BeautyBlender than it took me when I was using my fingers to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> wet or dry works wonderful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this just for a few days, and its amazing!</li>
            <li> so that was kind of strange</li>
            <li> As long as your cleanser isn&#x27;t cream based, I would think you could use a dab of your own cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of a Beautyblender, it&#x27;s really great for getting the right coverage with oily foundations, especially drugstore foundations.</li>
            <li> Since I own these cute sponges, I hardly reach for my foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> I still apply my pressed powder with the regular puff it comes with, because I need a fair amount of powder on top due to my oily skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft, gives an airbrush look, easy to use, easy to clean, and the cleaner can be used for regular brushes as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried the blenders twice so far, and both times I&#x27;ve loved the results.</li>
            <li> if you like it and you have a good idea when u typically need to replace you can sign up to have it shipped to you as a subscription for even cheaper.</li>
            <li> This sponge is a wonder tool, no lines, supper soft, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> sure to wait until the sponge is dry to clean it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I was able to save a few bucks in this wasteful purchase.</li>
            <li> It really does leave my make-up looking more natural and radiant.  </li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t get a good lather and had used half the bottle.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Product was tossed around a bit</li>
            <li> But back to this review; I was surprised that the cleanser was a good size bottle</li>
            <li> I used mine dry, for a more full coverage, and use the tapered side to blend out concealer.</li>
            <li> but there is only a very, very light scent</li>
            <li> I put the cleanser on the BB and very gently massaged it and worked the soap in</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used very much at all</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s easy to create a transition between the makeup on my face and my neck, without applying makeup all the way down my neck.</li>
            <li> Normally the way we would clean our make up brushes is to swirl them into the palm of our hand with soap and water,</li>
            <li> I used to clean them again with hand soap after soaking just to make sure it was really clean, but after finding that no makeup residue was showing up anymore after a few brushes, I just rinsed them off.  </li>
            <li> I like the cleanser very much also although I&#x27;m sure I could get the same results from using an antibacterial hand soap to cleanse the sponge.</li>
            <li> and but the sponges always come clean and look new again...</li>
            <li> Also, for the first year I started using the beautyblender - I refused to buy the BeautyBlender cleanser..</li>
            <li> I hesitated for months before buying this item because I thought how could a sponge be worth that much $???</li>
            <li> It definitely takes more time compared to cleaning brushes.</li>
            <li> first so I could include it.</li>
            <li> Of course I only tried it with powder, it may soak up more liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> those interested in the blue sponge that can be found at Target, be aware that the foam material used to make it is more dense and it does not \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; on your face quite as well.</li>
            <li> For those interested in the blue sponge that can be found at Target, be aware that the foam material used to make it is more dense and it does not \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; on your face quite as well.</li>
            <li> Before I used mine the first time, I washed my sponge with the included Blender Cleaner under hot water, and it didn&#x27;t run at all.</li>
            <li> and I know exactly how they are.</li>
            <li> I first read about it on a make-up website I use and had been contemplating buying one for some time.</li>
            <li> It makes your makeup go on so smoothly and naturally.</li>
            <li> It does offer a more sheer coverage as opposed to a dense brush.</li>
            <li> so pretty</li>
            <li> but I guess nothing can,,,,,,,, Im still on my first sponge</li>
            <li> An absolute must for anyone who uses liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> First off, you don&#x27;t end up with powder all over your clothes, the bathroom floor, etc...</li>
            <li> It all ends up on your face, which I&#x27;m sure is saving me on powder and subsequently $$.&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li> but if you aren&#x27;t willing to experiment or learn then it might not be for you.</li>
            <li> First off this is a great price for what you get, much cheaper than Sephora where I usually purchase my beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> I really really like these!</li>
            <li> it goes on so smooth and looks natural.</li>
            <li> The beauty blender sponge is life changing for anyone who wants to contour and highlightlike a pro!</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and may never go back to using a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> The first one I&#x27;ve used up to 6 months</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing the cleaner</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these beauty blenders, I kept one for personal use and use the for clients.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I finally got my hands on these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most definitely never buy them again and post a video on my YouTube recommending them not.</li>
            <li> I bought two together still using on the first one</li>
            <li> really well!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more for my clients.</li>
            <li> so I am sure this will last me through the life of the sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it did the same job, maybe even better.</li>
            <li> I tried MANY cleansers, face washes, soaps, etc., and the only thing that worked was dish soap (saw this on another Amazon review)...</li>
            <li> Have tried this product many times before and actually bought this kit as a Christmas gift!  </li>
            <li> I dampen the sponge first and then use it to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> It started tearing apart while washing it for the first time.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that I couldn&#x27;t get the cleansing solution to come out of the bottle at all and had to screw off the top to use it.  </li>
            <li> However, since I still had the second one I thought I would give it one more chance.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to all the girls :))</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried the Blender sponge and feel like throwing away my make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> These are not fake</li>
            <li> they are the real deal!</li>
            <li> Well, the blender balls seemed ok from the outside</li>
            <li> When I saw these, with their nice egg shape and hot pink color, I thought I&#x27;d give them a shot, and they are wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I  have so many different type of foundation brushes but</li>
            <li> but other then that i love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought from sephora before and they are the exact same ones at a better price.</li>
            <li> I REAL beautyblender will not be like this!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This one is longer, does not become as fluffy, and therefore it doesn&#x27;t work as good...</li>
            <li> cleanser is amazing, and gets the foundation right out, so the sponge stays a nice bright pink and never feels dirty.</li>
            <li> It does a fine job of cleansing the blender of all makeup and oil residue so that it&#x27;s fresh for next time.</li>
            <li> I was super hesitant to spend this amount of money on a sponge, but I needed new brushes anyway and after watching youtube reviews, I decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s used wet and easy to clean after each client with access to water terminal of some sort.</li>
            <li> I switched back to my stippling brush which honestly, did a better job and used less foundation.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to spend this kind of money for the Beauty Blender because there are so many similar products that cost waaay less.</li>
            <li> and when o used it, it used more product then my brush or hand and really had to same look afterwards.</li>
            <li> It makes my foundation more natural and soft.</li>
            <li> my blenders also last me a good 6 months with proper care.</li>
            <li> the soap pump is probably only good enough for 1 of the eggs</li>
            <li> So where a blender application was taking 2-3 full pumps of Missha BB Cream, finger application was taking under 1 full pump and getting the same level of coverage.</li>
            <li> Price is kinda high, but definately worth it.  </li>
            <li> , however you want to make sure that you don&#x27;t use too much and dry out your Beautyblender, so think of it more as spot cleaning than trying to soak the entire thing in soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping is much appreciated!  </li>
            <li> water-based foundation, which matches my skin perfectly and goes on extremely light (it also smells faintly of rosewater, making it extra</li>
            <li> It never leaves any lines or streaks, to clean wait for it to be completely dry then clean with the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery at first spending so much on a &#x27;sponge&#x27; but this is so SO much better than a sponge!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it was that easy, so I went to check it out in a variety of different lighting, convinced that there must be some streak or blob somewhere</li>
            <li> I set it on top of my muji makeup drawers and just pop it in there to dry after I use/wash it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you get the blender wet first, then squeeze it out, before applying foundation.  </li>
            <li> I was using the pedestal that comes with it to dry the blender on top of as a way to push out the cleanser</li>
            <li> I find it works better when the beauty blender is completely dry</li>
            <li> The knock offs don&#x27;t last nearly as long and don&#x27;t do as good a job.</li>
            <li> , it was a good buy considered the price of how much they usually are .</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t beat this price when a single beautyblender sells for $20 at sephora :)</li>
            <li> My large pores and acne are concealed after applying any liquid foundation with the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> but I also makes it last longer, the cleaner doesn&#x27;t clean as well as I expected but in overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> To use the dispenser you&#x27;re supposed to push the blender onto the top, but the liquid doesn&#x27;t really get absorbed and ends up squirting down the side of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The  Beauty Blender really blends out your foundation quick and seamlessly.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best beauty tool that I have purchased in the last ten years.</li>
            <li> in all I see this as a great product for those who are professionals or everyday people who enjoy a light natural coverage with very little effort.</li>
            <li> In a well ventilated place, it&#x27;s all right, but it&#x27;s good to keep in mind that you don&#x27;t want it to stay wet too long, or it will mildew.</li>
            <li> I used it and it was fine no big deal.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m usually don&#x27;t wear make up... but the first time i used this...i&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li> I love using these on my dry skin!</li>
            <li> This actually cleans my brushes and the blender so quickly and thoroughly!</li>
            <li> This little make up sponge is amazing.</li>
            <li> Have been loving the beautyblender, it does seem to add a little bit of time to my makeup schedule</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s true that it won&#x27;t suck up all your foundation-when I clean it minimal amounts of product are washed away.  </li>
            <li> But after wetting one and using it for the first time, WOW!!</li>
            <li> It takes out all the makeup and turns the sponge back to its bright pink color.</li>
            <li> While I was apprehensive about spending so much on sponges, I really don&#x27;t like liquid foundation much.  </li>
            <li> You need to get the real ones.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was ready to post this review then and there, but decided to try out the cleanser</li>
            <li> really like the cleanser that comes with the BeautyBlender too.</li>
            <li> That said, I really like this sponge.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> -Very</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need that much foundation  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really like that.</li>
            <li> My friend was using her REAL beauty blender from sephora on me...</li>
            <li> the real one does.</li>
            <li> Yes, these are the real deal.</li>
            <li> P.S. Shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> , i really recommend this to anyone with a budget.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast and I&#x27;m amazed how well the product works</li>
            <li> Soo much hype over these beauty blenders</li>
            <li> I refused to buy it and only bought the look-a-like cheap kinds.</li>
            <li> About the beauty blender itself, I do not need it as much anymore.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t hold a candle to the real deal.</li>
            <li> it really helps blend and even all of my makeup.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind so much when it&#x27;s time to throw it away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to get the coverage</li>
            <li> and it is very helpful</li>
            <li> I wont say much because this product speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> So this sponge didn&#x27;t really make a difference.     </li>
            <li> To me that&#x27;s just too much work.</li>
            <li> Because the foam is so dense, it doesn&#x27;t soak up tons of foundation like some sponges do, and it applies it very evenly.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need a cleanser- 2 dollar baby shampoo works just as well.</li>
            <li> I like the sponges, they do work really well in foundation application.</li>
            <li> But I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the cheaper imitations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d absolutely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I really like the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> The hype is for real.</li>
            <li> I really don;t like it.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to test it out so lets save me some gas</li>
            <li> And it came fast.</li>
            <li> product was real and as described.</li>
            <li> So this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product !</li>
            <li> I think one is the real thing</li>
            <li> They soak up way too much product.</li>
            <li> sponge really blew me away.  </li>
            <li> It really cleaned up all the \\&quot;life\\&quot; problems on my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is alot of cleanser, it doesnt take too much</li>
            <li> Works better when the sponge is wet.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried the Beautyblender and are thinking about it, I highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> It wears out really fast (2 wks</li>
            <li> Very versatile applicator.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleanser dispenser isn&#x27;t very functional.</li>
            <li> I really do like the cleanser.</li>
            <li> It really cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li> not with this beauty blender it makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> Very flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have seen lots of reviews that say &amp;#34;used so much product&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why this item costs so much.</li>
            <li> and it didn’t seem to make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it too often because I don&#x27;t hav a lot of time to get ready in the morning..</li>
            <li> The cleanser works really well for the beauty blenders as well as my brushes.  </li>
            <li> With this cleanser, it is so gentle and cleans the sponge easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I hadn&#x27;t caved and bought the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really ify about buying this out of fear</li>
            <li> For years I have heard the raves on youtube about the beauty blender, and I wasn&#x27;t ready to put out the money for one.</li>
            <li> The sponge really does blend my make up really well.</li>
            <li> Makes putting foundation on so much easier.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> These are real the real beautyblenders.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> as much</li>
            <li> you get the Beauty Blender, then you really have to get the blendercleanser.  </li>
            <li> The application and wash was so much easier than a brush too.</li>
            <li> These have made my foundation routine so much easier.</li>
            <li> I was wasting so much makeup every day.  </li>
            <li> have only washed one of the blenders once thus far, so I am not yet sure how they hold up over time.</li>
            <li> Seems that most stores are selling this product at or near the same price.</li>
            <li> I will not repurchase, kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I hate the feel of makeup, so the beauty blender is perfect for light and even applications.</li>
            <li> this is far superior to any round makeup sponge you can buy at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> This provides a nice finish to my liquid foundation, but not a huge difference from just using my fingers.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t clean them every single day, I&#x27;m sure to be left with blemishes.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and soft to the touch, and does not give me that cringe-y feeling I normally get when touching typical foam.</li>
            <li> and when you finally try, you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s very worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Everyone and I mean everyone had nothing but good things to say about the Beautyblender</li>
            <li> The one that I feel to be &amp;#34;the real beauty blender&amp;#34; feels better and cleans easier than the other.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was trying to clean out the very tip.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, fantastic sponge!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it came to my door that I ripped open the box, tossed my RT sponge, and took off the makeup I was wearing</li>
            <li> Also once I dampened the sponge it felt different, and a lot tougher than my original beauty blunders.</li>
            <li> Not everything you buy on the internet is authentic and I&#x27;m upset because that was $25 spent!</li>
            <li> But other than that, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Work better than any other sponge I have tried.</li>
            <li> These are not the original beauty blenders, they are a slightly different shape and texture.</li>
            <li> It makes applying foundation a breeze, better than any other way I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Take one with you and keep the other safe at home.&lt;br /&gt;Washable, re-useable, recyclable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually saving money because the Beautyblender applies the make up evenly and it&#x27;s unique shape gets into the curves and contours of my face.</li>
            <li> Soap is great just a little drop goes a long way for cleaning product.</li>
            <li> I have read MANY reviews of this happening with ColorStay with other people as well,</li>
            <li> They were also smaller than the original.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean well well when the make up is still wet on the sponge right after you use it, so</li>
            <li> Recommended to clean with massaging only fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> comments go mainly to the cleanser, which works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever cleaned my makeup brushes with whatever shampoo and soap I had laying around, even the tried and true baby shampoo, but this cleanser has changed my world and has made life so much easier..</li>
            <li> and they never left totally clean though</li>
            <li> Clean enough though.</li>
            <li> I like to wet the sponge first to get a light amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> One \\&quot;swoosh\\&quot; of the sponge in the basin, per the instructions, is never enough to clean the sponge.</li>
            <li> If I had to say one negative thing it would be that I use more foundation now, but that&#x27;s true of any sponge.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, even if it is just to clean your current brushes.</li>
            <li> I had tried a similar sponge in design without knowing how to use it appropriately or clean it.</li>
            <li> I think you end up using a little bit more with beauty blenders than brushes, but I think it is easier to get a more natural sheer look with these beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> Then I would take my foundation brush and smear foundation all over my face, blend a little with a knock off blender or a kabuki brush, then I would put a super light concealer under my eyes and contour the rest of my face then blend again either with a kabuki brush or the knock off brushes.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re totally worth the money, and the little plastic container they come in makes it easy to pack for travel as well.</li>
            <li> And it blows me away that a sponge needs a special cleaner, albeit it can also wash your brushes, but it literally smells like the same brush cleaner CVS brand $5.</li>
            <li> So I only used my on special occasion .</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to buy this since it is a bit pricey, but it is definitely leaps and bounds better than the regular make up sponges.</li>
            <li> This is my first review, but I was so pleasantly surprised by how well this product works that I had to leave some feedback.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are very, very expensive but this sponge did allow me to accomplish the best application of foundation ever.</li>
            <li> I just add a couple squirts of the cleanser into a small bucket of warm water, swish all the brushes around and leave them in there to soak for 30-45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this with MAC full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall great foundation/concealer/blender tool, as long as not on a very tight budget.</li>
            <li> this little pink tear drop of joy has changed my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> They really get cleaned in less washes than normally, and they are truly clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I clean mine after every use and use the cleaner very sparingly, it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I feel like I get more coverage with less product.</li>
            <li> I find I use less product and get a better finish.</li>
            <li> if purchasing from amazon, as it&#x27;s a better value, and you&#x27;ll have an extra one for travel, or to alternate between the sponges if you don&#x27;t feel like cleaning them all the time!</li>
            <li> Classic sponge.</li>
            <li> When I use my fingers, my foundation ends up looking caked on, my skin feels greasy, and I look about 10 years older.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product its something i can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and \\&quot;bouncy\\&quot; and I think it applies my liquid foundation very well.</li>
            <li> I wash mine before every single use-which is really important because it does soak up foundation and will lock it in, causing stains and bacteria.</li>
            <li> I think it is high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of high end brushes</li>
            <li> I value Amazon&#x27;s reviews highly and also sent this as a gift to my aunt and mother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of high quality foundation brushes (spending a LOT of money) - and they are ALL inferior compared to this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is highly over rated</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> id highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> from the high end make sponges to the target ones to the dollar store ones...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> They are amazing for not only blending, but also contouring due to the pointy and blunt sides.</li>
            <li> There is a reason why magazines, makeup artists, YouTube beauty gurus and regular folks are raving about the beauty blender...because it actually delivers what it promises...beautifully blended foundation that is actually easy to do and rather a fast task to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure to let the blender air dry completely (the package has a clear plastic stand to use), or else the blender can and will grow mold (friend&#x27;s experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about all the rave reviews our there about this product, but I am happy to say that this item actually lives up to the hype!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more involved</li>
            <li> I also like the packaging since there is a sperator in the container that allows me to keep the un-used sponge on the bottom and the one I am using on the top, it also has a little lid for the container.  </li>
            <li> The more I&#x27;ve used it little pieces of the sponge break off.</li>
            <li> However, I waited on writing this review because I wanted to have a little more \\&quot;blending time\\&quot; under my belt.</li>
            <li> Remember to spray the little sponge with a bit of water or makeup staying product and you&#x27;ll get even better results.</li>
            <li> I had only previously used either my fingers (pretty uneven application, and it would kind of sit on top of my face and look pretty gross), or a foundation brush (even application, but you had to use a lot</li>
            <li> These little sponges wear so well, give you a flawless and airbrushed finish for your makeup, and ultimately cause you to use less product as well!</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much (but something to consider if you have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, blends makeup very evenly &amp; leaves an airbrush finish.</li>
            <li> Just what a young woman wants fior beauty.</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on very evenly and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I spent years as a makeup artist working at Sephora, and I was given free products all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the beauty blender for a couple months, and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t clean it until it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if it is really worth the $$$ you can find similar sponges that work just as well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over a few days of experimenting I found that swiping it on produces a more even result than blotting it on.  </li>
            <li> and that takes suuuuper long especially if you have a handful of brushes, and sometimes we might have to dip them in soap twice or more.</li>
            <li> It is worth it and is actually cheaper.</li>
            <li> Just buy it, its worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Some items are worth paying extra!</li>
            <li> good stuff, just the box is poor packaged, and the liquid leak all over the box when I got it.</li>
            <li> Put the blendercleanser on a dry sponge (I clean it right before I need to use it again the next morning) and massage the cleanser in.  </li>
            <li> Love this blender cuts my make up time in half!</li>
            <li> Takes me less time to put on my foundation and looks more natural.</li>
            <li> Yes it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but you have to take more time with it, dampening it before use, applying makeup, then cleansing it and putting it to dry for the next use.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BEAUTY BLENDER especially when I have dry skin bc</li>
            <li> The double pack and cleanser was priced just right.  </li>
            <li> If you have acne, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money, no matter how hard I try to get a good full coverage using the beauty blender, it just doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I did not realize  they were giving such a large bottle of the cleanser (5 fl oz).</li>
            <li> First reason is the obvious high cost of the blenders.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> so before i get anything new</li>
            <li> I asked if she had new makeup, what she was doing</li>
            <li> I use these sponges every day--they really do live up to the hype and price.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m always on the look out for new ways to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> I always thought it was a foundation problem and kept trying new ones, with no luck.</li>
            <li> and my cleanser looked BRAND NEW.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without a BB</li>
            <li> They asked me if I was using a new foundation, or a new face wash.</li>
            <li> I told them about the beauty blender and that that was the new product I was using.</li>
            <li> will say that this buy makes more sense for makeup geeks that have a daily contour and cat eye routine rather than those that are less intense about their beauty routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely wet the sponge before using and clean after every use.</li>
            <li> It is harder to clean it when the sponge is wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makeup and pink dye will coat your sink when you clean the sponges.</li>
            <li> My blender still got stained and the pink fades though it is clean.</li>
            <li> I had to do multiple rounds of soaping and lathering before I could get the sponge to a point where I&#x27;d be comfortable using it again the next day...</li>
            <li> I do not see much of a difference between this and Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge (it&#x27;s only $6!!!)</li>
            <li> You use minimal amount of makeup and you are able to spread it evently across your entire face.</li>
            <li> I love these lil too big pink spongies.</li>
            <li> It makes my makeup application process so much faster, the large end of the sponge lets me quickly blend my whole face and the smaller pointy end is helpful for using around my nose and for covering up my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this little sponge!  </li>
            <li> Not sure that these do any better than any other smooth, make-up sponge.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much (about the size of a dime, which is what is dispensed if you use the bottle as directed) if you are cleaning your sponge on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It makes my makeup look very natural-</li>
            <li> It is a very soft foam</li>
            <li> Very, very natural finish.</li>
            <li> I find that after using the beauty blender for my foundation and concealer, I look very natural, almost as though I didn&#x27;t even put any makeup on.</li>
            <li> love the sponges love the cleaner, hate the price, really makes your makeup look pretty though.</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy about spending this much on a makeup sponge, but it was definitely worth the splurge!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I usually order from Sephora, but this was a better deal.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> When I initially washed it the first time, some color rinsed out, however, that didn&#x27;t affect its job nor did the color fade, so I wasn&#x27;t bothered with that.</li>
            <li> But I compared this to the beauty blender I bought from Sephora and they are the exact same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The way I prefer using these is to first apply foundation all around my face with regular foundation brush without bothering to blend it out.</li>
            <li> and it looks natural!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The one from Sephora seems to be the exact same as the one I bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> So minus those two issues i mentioned (which are kind of big especially for the price i paid</li>
            <li> remember during the first week doing double takes when I saw myself in a mirror.</li>
            <li> The stains from my brushes that I thought were permanent from foundations, lip colors, eye creams or concealers have all been completely washed away!</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in trying beauty blenders or who just want to stock up.</li>
            <li> The blender was easy to use and definitely should be used in it&#x27;s \\&quot;wet\\&quot; application form vs. dry.</li>
            <li> I use the cleaning wash to clean ALL my brushes and love the faint lavender smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the BB thins out product to look a step down from what it should (med cov items look like light cov and so forth).</li>
            <li> also use this cleanser to clean all of my other makeup</li>
            <li> I tried cleaning the Beautyblender with other cheaper products and it just didn&#x27;t &#x27;come clean&#x27; as well as when I used the cleanser.</li>
            <li> But it does it&#x27;s job extremely well, and I also use it to clean my brushes.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dye coming out of the sponge, though the cleaner doesn&#x27;t 100% get the sponge clean.</li>
            <li> What I thought was clean was not really quite so!</li>
            <li> Although generally I wouldn&#x27;t buy cleanser this expensive, I am happy that I have it.</li>
            <li> It gives me a smooth and airbrush finish in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I think I will refill the empty container with a mild liquid soap.</li>
            <li> I had not washed my Blender in a few days, and I used the cleanser for the first time today... and with 3-4 pumps of the cleanser, plus a little warm water-</li>
            <li> The cleanser has a nice mild lavender scent which I was afraid would be too strong, but it&#x27;s pretty subtle.</li>
            <li> The makeup looked so much more professional compared to the quality of my previous applications using a regular sponge, brush or my fingertips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Clean after EACH use and allow to air dry or your sponge will become moldy and cause breakouts!  </li>
            <li> I just recently purchased the pure sponge as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever have a problem getting my powder on smoothly anyway; it&#x27;s always been the foundation that has given me a little bit of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They last a while as long as you take care and clean it after every use.</li>
            <li> and I agree that it is best to do very thin layers and let it dry and then add another layer, if necessary.</li>
            <li> I mean vivid bright pink water shouldn&#x27;t be coming out as I rinse it, unless that&#x27;s the color makeup I applied.    </li>
            <li> I mean, yeah, it&#x27;s a cool sponge but not that much better than other copies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen tutorials apply directly to the BB and in all my experiments the BB eats up some of the product.</li>
            <li> the all mineral \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; action tends to buff away any concealing effect and defeat the purpose.</li>
            <li> It seems designed to keep the product on the outside, so you don&#x27;t lose as much foundation (and $$$) by having it sucked into a sponge.     </li>
            <li> It can give anyone professional-looking results, even if you&#x27;re like me and are far from being considered a makeup artist.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft and squishy and I can&#x27;t wait to use them 😊</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all ready for the next use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely different size, texture and results to the real thing.</li>
            <li> Gives a natural look</li>
            <li> so I did so far</li>
            <li> The sponge is soft and the cleaner works well.</li>
            <li> so professional makeup artists give his a 10 star rate.</li>
            <li> I tried to buy a generic sponge and its NOTHING compared to the real product.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser gets all the makeup out completely every time.</li>
            <li> As long as Beautyblender&#x27;s in business, I&#x27;ll be supporting them.</li>
            <li> but my friend&lt;br /&gt;says it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the makeup from the Beautyblender.</li>
            <li> but I really dislike the price of these sponges I did see a generic brand in the store for about $2</li>
            <li> My makeup routine has been COMPLETELY transformed by this tool.</li>
            <li> I already owned a beauty blender in which it was getting old and need cleaned</li>
            <li> So far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it might be great for liquid foundation application the blender is just the wrong tool for BB Creams; and BB Creams are turning out to be far better than foundation, making the blender an unnecessary tool.</li>
            <li> Makes application seamless .</li>
            <li> As much as it&#x27;s raved about, for what this costs I&#x27;d rather just use knockoffs or basic sponges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these before, but I purchased them from a big brand beauty store and paid almost twice as much to get each product separately.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> Off brands are not as soft.</li>
            <li> Wish I had not wasted time/ money on dupes....</li>
            <li> I use the tiny end to apply my spot concealer, and the rounded end to apply a finishing powder (which also blends it much nicer than my kabuki brush</li>
            <li> After hearing so much about them, I finally gave in a decided to see if Beauty Blenders are all they’re cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> how much foundation you&#x27;ll actually need which shouldn&#x27;t be a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that cleaning the sponge daily really helps extend it&#x27;s life, so finding a deal with two blenders, plus a generous bottle of the cleaner was a win-win.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several before from sephora, but Amazon shipped so much faster.</li>
            <li> same of pic..just the taxes was so much</li>
            <li> I find that the beautyblender really speeds up the process of putting on foundation if you only use one layer.</li>
            <li> Makes the second layer really cakey.</li>
            <li> and I agree the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; way is far better.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Why, because this sponge does not waste any makeup.</li>
            <li> When it is my current BBs time to go, I will probably only re-buy if on sale, since I’d rather not drop a ton of money on a sponge that might fall apart right away.</li>
            <li> The kit is extremely convenient and I recommend it highly for those purchasing this tool for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shape of it is also great, it allows you to use various angles to target large, small or hard to get to areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hands down favorite use for this is to apply loose powder</li>
            <li> I am not sure if one of these is supposed to be travel sized, and one full size, but they appear to be the same exact size.</li>
            <li> Beautyblender is a great tool, the cleanser gets dirty really easily and sometimes hard to pump.</li>
            <li> The cleanser sits opposite of my hand soap in my bathroom and the blender is typically always on top of the pedestal inside of the cleanser drying from when I cleaned it last.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering them, i lost my first ine, also i havent used the cleaner before but decided to order it because my last one i didnt like how it felt after cleaning it with soap...i will update</li>
            <li> My only problem is that one of them ripped a tiny bit in the first week I bought it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, last a very long time</li>
            <li> I noticed that a few people complained about the pink dye washing off onto their skin, but I am very fair complected and this never happened to me.</li>
            <li> In addition, they consistently discharge pink ink every time you wet them, no matter how many times you wash they still discharge pink dye, which is totally gross.</li>
            <li> I read on another review that sometimes it is easier to clean the Blender if you let it dry after you apply makeup, and wash it later in the day/the next morning.</li>
            <li> and I think I prefer to wet the sponge first, but either way works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like getting them wet first because the foundation goes on a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> By getting it wet first the makeup does not soak into the sponge.</li>
            <li> These sponges make it very easy to get even coverage using a minimal amount of product in a fraction of the time it took me to apply foundation in the past.</li>
            <li> This beauty sponge is much more durable than any other that I had previously used.  </li>
            <li> After about 1-2 more weeks of use they both split in same place where hard spot formed.</li>
            <li> Say goodby to those ugly, dark under-eye circles because with the Beauty Blender &amp; your favorite concealer, you won&#x27;t see them any more!</li>
            <li> so I switched back to Sue Devitt and now it&#x27;s like brand new after every wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought the dispenser would be easy to use but it is awkward to get the amount out that you want, and the dispenser gets makeup all over it from whatever sponge you are trying to clean.</li>
            <li> i dint see much benefit from it dry.</li>
            <li> I use one wet for overall coverage, and then use the dry one to dab a bit extra under my eyes or anywhere else that needs a bit more attention.</li>
            <li> It is worth it alone in how much less foundation</li>
            <li> it make my foundation look soo professional and natural on face like the celebrities on red carpet</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s super easy to get into small corners around your nose/eyes with the small end.</li>
            <li> and I love the soft, lavender scent it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> no other sponges compare.</li>
            <li> The Beauty Blender is like no other make-up sponge you will ever use.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no other product in my routine to use the blender on</li>
            <li> and yes I&#x27;ve tried dupes but there is no other sponge out there like this one.</li>
            <li> BUT this sponge is like no other.  </li>
            <li> I wash it right before my next use since its used wet anyway.</li>
            <li> The sponge&#x27;s shape is easy to use: you can cover large areas fast + get into small delicate areas, like under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer mineral makeup to liquid, and the only way I&#x27;ve found to get adequate coverage is to start with a thick creme concealer (like dermablend) on the blemishes, then go over my whole face with a mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> Quality is as expected, very high.</li>
            <li> While a little expensive, the Beautyblender offers great coverage for makeup.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but low expectations, as they seemed pretty gimmicky.</li>
            <li> I mean, you&#x27;re getting along just fine with your brushes and fingers,</li>
            <li> Idk how they do it, but the sponge isnt a regular sponge, It feels and works professionally.</li>
            <li> As suggested, I wet the Beautyblender, squeeze out the excess water in my hands then gently in a towel.</li>
            <li> I ended up washing the blender 3 times, then used my regular brush cleanser to get everything completely off.</li>
            <li> As long as you take a brief moment to learn the proper technique for using the sponge, it&#x27;s pretty fool-proof.</li>
            <li> But so far it has been doing the same thing for me.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t shown any sign up wear or tear, and they&#x27;ve barely faded.</li>
            <li> Give me such a natural look.</li>
            <li> A must have in your personal and professional make up kit.</li>
            <li> I used to use either a brush or one of those old school white sponges, but I will always go to my beauty blender from here on out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Revlon ColorStay Foundation which completely and totally stains BB</li>
            <li> After you have applied your makeup and are set and ready to go wet the sponge again and rinse it then go over your face again</li>
            <li> They did arrive on time but the liquid was not closed</li>
            <li> and I just recently has to repurchase because it was getting old and tattered up.</li>
            <li> Definitely a must have in any makeup kit, professional or not.</li>
            <li> The blender did bleed some pink colour during the first several washings, but It never bled on my face during</li>
            <li> First of all the 2 sponges were different shades of pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I agree with all the hype about this, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I have not had the problem that some other customers have had with the pink dye &#x27;running&#x27; when I wash it, and the cleanser seemed to clean the sponge well.</li>
            <li> I get even coverage and no little hairs from my brushes now that I use the blender only.</li>
            <li> So if you decide to use these, expect the small bottles of foundation to last less amount of time than normally, and hence more burden on your pockets.&lt;br</li>
            <li> kit comes in a small, clear, rectangle box with the beauty blender packaging in the circle container as shown and the cleanser right along side of it.</li>
            <li> Just let it dry and wash it before bed, and it will be ready for use the next day.</li>
            <li> I paid $19.99 for my first Blender alone, and for $30 some odd bucks, I got 2 Blenders and the cleaner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do need the cleanser to clean, if not the sponge gets hard</li>
            <li> I get really oily that it was very minimal to when I use to apply with a brush.</li>
            <li> - at least it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the brown color, but I am assuming it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> one blender seems different than the other but both work the exact same so no complaints!</li>
            <li> I was a little weary at first</li>
            <li> It smells a little funny</li>
            <li> Using the sponges makes make-up go on so smoothly, and you use so little of the product compared to other modes.</li>
            <li> bought the single at first and then the double so I can have one dry, one damp and for powder.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d been eying it for months, but not sure it was worth the price.)    </li>
            <li> When I first tried them out, I was infatuated.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t give up if the first few time you use it you find the finish is not what you want.</li>
            <li> I was being very gentle and don’t have very long or sharp nails that it could get caught on or anything.</li>
            <li> so i have to use a little more foundation then usual.</li>
            <li> My fav is MAC full coverage cream foundation, I use LESS with a wet beauty blender than a brush or regular sponge.</li>
            <li> Makes blending a breeze, no more noticeable line around my face if my shade isn&#x27;t exactly right.</li>
            <li> Let it dry completely before u wash it &amp; it will not stain.</li>
            <li> You get a pretty generous sized bottle, the only downside being the dispensing tip, as it tends to waste a bit of product</li>
            <li> It did take a few tries before I figured out exactly how wet the sponge should be and how much makeup was needed.</li>
            <li> It is just a little difficult to clean it, but the blendercleanser does a better job than the other regular cleansers I used to use before purchasing this combo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been absolutely amazed at the results I&#x27;ve gotten from this little sponge.</li>
            <li> I have been absolutely amazed at the results I&#x27;ve gotten from this little sponge.</li>
            <li> The price may be a little steep, but it&#x27;s a very well-made product that won&#x27;t just fall apart.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, this was recommended in a beauty book I read and after reading all the reviews I hesitantly bought this, (the price just seems steep for a little sponge (or two) , but.....</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but a little pricey for this thing</li>
            <li> I kept thinking that surely this little pink sponge couldn&#x27;t be THAT great, and I thought the price seemed a little crazy for just a simple little sponge and some cleanser.</li>
            <li> I probably used half as much product as usual, and there wasn&#x27;t a huge powdery mess on the table.</li>
            <li> The first few times you wash the blender pink dye runs out in the water, but no pink dye is ever transferred from the blender to your makeup</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cleanser is dispensed from the bottle by gently pushing the sponge down on the pedestal (exactly like the picture, you just push down and a small amount of cleanser is dispensed directly on to the sponge.</li>
            <li> It cuts down on time in the morning for me and helps me avoid the 4 different brushes I normally use.</li>
            <li> I normally have to push the pump down with my fingers and then flip the bottle over so the gel can slide onto my hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s going to last me, but I can get a brush for 20 dollars and it&#x27;ll last me for 10 years, the beauty blender will last for probably 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li> Down side... those stores are so damn far for me!</li>
            <li> Usually this involves several minutes of patting, gentle buffing, blending, patting again to replace the coverage that was lost from the buffing, etc.</li>
            <li> Also, Target offers a similar product in blue, at half the price, you could also check that out too.</li>
            <li> these will last a long time if they are properly cared for as well!!!!</li>
            <li> I normally apply my liquid foundation with my fingers, and oftentimes it has left me with a slightly uneven finish that I end up having to touch up to try to even it out.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard you try, I can guarantee that there will be some sort of stain on your sponge after your first use.  </li>
            <li> I had been alternating between the BB and my brushes, but recently bought Hard Candy’s Glamoflauge Foundation, which ends up being very streaky when using brushes and I can only use the BB with.</li>
            <li> (in the pictures it appears to be a flat sponge with a teardrop shape).  </li>
            <li> long lasting</li>
            <li> last ALL DAY LONG, I never have to touch up my foundtaion now if im going out after work...</li>
            <li> it cleans well, has minimal to no scent, and doesn&#x27;t leave any apparent residue on the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price held me back for a long time, but once I took the plunge</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day and it seems like it will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been happier with how my makeup looks, thanks to this little pink sponge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been happier with how my makeup looks, thanks to this little pink sponge.</li>
            <li> Well, here I am a year later, and I can&#x27;t say enough about these pink spongy miracles.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and get compiments on my clear skin!</li>
            <li> The Blender Cleaner doesn&#x27;t lather up very well, and it&#x27;s hard to work it in well with the sponge.</li>
            <li> works amazing, however my cleaning soap bottle leaks, could of just been a badly made one, who knows.</li>
            <li> I softly went in with the front of my nail to try and force out astain and noticed a small rip in it the next day.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cleaner was yellow in color and smells old.</li>
            <li> I also like the narrow soft end for applying concealer.</li>
            <li> Received mine earlier than expected and the cleaning soap was larger than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see how long the sponges hold up -- the package reads 3 months.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be bigger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used multiple foundation weights: sheer, regular, and heavy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s takes to long.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this sponge at first, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it at all!!</li>
            <li> The items sent to me were a completely different size when the sponges were both dry and wet.</li>
            <li> I tried applying foundation with them, but they are super absorbent and therefore not ideal for that purpose.</li>
            <li> The sponge totally soaks up a lot of the product (not as much as other sponges) so cleaning it can take a while.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product, I looked up and watched reviews on youtube and various other sites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cotton swabs, wedge sponges, and a million different other applicators, but none of them seemed to be compatible with BM.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was about to give up and go back on the hunt for some other brand, when I decided to order this Beautyblender combo.  </li>
            <li> I should have switched a long time ago!</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to buy into the hype,  but it&#x27;s truly did make a difference!</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a definite buy!</li>
            <li> I still have a powder brush, blush brush and eye brushes, but for the basics, I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to any other method again.</li>
            <li> It dissolves and cleans all the makeup built up not only on my beauty blenders, but on all my other brushes as well</li>
            <li> On the days when I&#x27;m in a rush and decide to mayyybe blend a little with my fingers, I can instantly tell the difference and immediately go back to the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cons:  -Difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> a while to dry.</li>
            <li> Put the cleaner on the sponge while it&#x27;s dry, and rub it in with your hands.</li>
            <li> I use the cleanser when I&#x27;m finished and leave it to air dry</li>
            <li> Damp or dry.</li>
            <li> but i guess there is a dry way of using it.</li>
            <li> I like to then wrap it in a dry paper towel to remove the excess water</li>
            <li> I helped hydrate my skin so whatever face product I use it won&#x27;t cling onto my dry skin  (when my skin is dry and flaky).</li>
            <li> Use damp or dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my dry patches stand out</li>
            <li> both then let it dry or pat dry with a tissue.  </li>
            <li> the item said: 2 beautyblenders, 1 blendercleanser, beautyblender portibility pouch, 1 sample of blendercleanser, instruction cards., plus the bottle of cleanser said that it comes with a pedestal to dry the beauty blender</li>
            <li> The quality of this BB seems the same when dried and moist, so I assume they are actual BB!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed to see my new one ripped a bit so quickly near the tip after only a few months however it still works fine</li>
            <li> I hated this product at first, that was because I didn&#x27;t read the instructions on how to use/ clean it properly.</li>
            <li> I was unsure whether these BB would be legitimate, so I purchased a single BB from Sephora in order to assure the quality of them.</li>
            <li> I have one I brought from sephora and the amazon one does not  dry and drink back to a small size like the sephora one.</li>
            <li> Stains can be hard to remove but usually come out well with VERY hot water.</li>
            <li> So far I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Finally I broke down and got myself the kit with two sponges and the 5oz cleanser, using an Amazon gift card I had.</li>
            <li> thee only down</li>
            <li> A little tiny bit of this cleanser goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use the Beautyblender on a daily basis and I find that I use less foundation than I would with a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I put a dab of foundation on each area of my face with my middle finger, then I take the slightly damp BeautyBlender and bounce it all over my face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a beauty blender before, you should wet it and then towel dry before applying product.</li>
            <li> but you also get the cleanser to go along with it and for half of what it would cost at your local store!  </li>
            <li> so what you pay for the BeautyBlender you may actually save on buying less foundation.     </li>
            <li> And the cleaner will last you half a lifetime</li>
            <li> I do the same now except it takes me much less time to blend everything together</li>
            <li> My last beauty blender broke in half</li>
            <li> I have used it both wet and dry</li>
            <li> This will not work if it&#x27;s dirty and to strong of a soap kills the sponge material.</li>
            <li> It bleeds pink a little but all the makeup is removed with no staining, at least after the first use.  </li>
            <li> This is enough to drag the review down a bit...</li>
            <li> Cleaning stuff had opened in the box before arrival but not biggy, didn&#x27;t make a big mess.</li>
            <li> It look at least 5 minutes of washing with the dish soap to accomplish what the cleanser accomplished in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Who knew this little blender could make SUCH a difference.</li>
            <li> This one seems smaller in the shape is a little off.</li>
            <li> Use 1 damp use the other 1 dry.</li>
            <li> But the brushes are terribly inconvenient to clean, and need to dry overnight (sometimes longer).</li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;ve been doing wrong for the past 18 years, but this was certainly an amazing find.  </li>
            <li> (NOT dripping wet, ring the water out...</li>
            <li> I have not really noticed a lot of pink water coming out when cleaning my BeautyBlender</li>
            <li> She tried to wet mine and it didn&#x27;t absorb the water and puff up all the way like</li>
            <li> I wet 1</li>
            <li> I have a few in rotation for different products!</li>
            <li> she explained how to use it in the wet form</li>
            <li> I like applying my liquid foundation with it wet.</li>
            <li> I did have a concern when I saw pink coming out of the sponge as I cleaned it, makes me wonder if some of the pink coloring is also coming off on my skin?</li>
            <li> fore there is minimal break outs</li>
            <li> One thing, the sponge releases a pink tint-coloring every time you wash it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually like a bulb with a narrow rounded tip</li>
            <li> when you wash it it all kinds of pink washes out with it</li>
            <li> I purchased these even though I thought they were expensive for makeup sponges, but they are worth it.  </li>
            <li> One thing I DO NOT LIKE about this product is that when I wash it, the pink color washes off too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to just foundation-color washing off my sponges so the pink color was a surprise for me.</li>
            <li> I tried it out a few times and after several trials, concluded that it was the beauty blender sponge that was causing my breakouts.</li>
            <li> the water runs pink...</li>
            <li> I assume that whatever dye is used to make these sponges pink</li>
            <li> The Pink Dye does run when I use the Beauty Blender Cleanser.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, no real complaints.</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t wet one of them</li>
            <li> If you try to wash the makeup out of a wet beauty blender, some stains may remain.</li>
            <li> these are not real beauty blenders</li>
            <li> I would have rather spent the money on another beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent that for a sponge</li>
            <li> It came when expected</li>
            <li> but once I wet them like the instructions</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as to whether a make-up sponge could actually be worth the cost of the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops of the cleaner is enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> I like the concept behind this sponge, but I&#x27;m not sure how much difference it made in the final look of my foundation.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been forced to become a major makeup consumer</li>
            <li> There are times where I grab for the other one because one of my blenders is dirty and I forgot to clean it.</li>
            <li> is for use for MUA&#x27;s or other professionals.</li>
            <li> Other soaps will cause the sponge to fall apart,and rip, etc....</li>
            <li> Items arrived quicker then expected!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think that this product would be any different from the disposable sponges that I usually get.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am not giving it 5 stars due to the price...</li>
            <li> (I saw some other reviewers had mentioned this).</li>
            <li> (I saw some other reviewers had mentioned this).</li>
            <li> This is not a knock off and after getting it wet it doubled in size!</li>
            <li> However you can just use it as you would any other sponge as well.</li>
            <li> I use the cleaner for my other brushes as well</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soak up all your foundation like other makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> and the other is not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be trying the other soap like cleanser for these sponges instead.</li>
            <li> the cleanser is good,though not sure it is necessary to purchase.</li>
            <li> Another reason is the fact that these blenders just like any other sponges absorb a lot of product.</li>
            <li> I have not used other sponge applicators before so I cannot compare with others.</li>
            <li> and I gave the other one to my sister.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried cleaning it with other methods</li>
            <li> my foundation/concealer any other way EVER again.</li>
            <li> The second one remained small.</li>
            <li> I thought it was any other makeup sponge</li>
            <li> They have cheaper ones on CVS and other stores.</li>
            <li> Instead of washing after use, I let it dry dirty and wash right before use.</li>
            <li> I also use it with my MAC paint pots if they are a little dry.</li>
            <li> (it bloated up rather alarmingly) and sat down at the makeup table expecting a steep learning curve.</li>
            <li> I needed a makeup sponge, and was loathe to buy those little white round or square ones --</li>
            <li> I have spend lots of money on imitation blenders.</li>
            <li> I apply my moisturizer, primers, and concealer with the pink ones and foundation and any cream bronzing with the black one (ordered separately).</li>
            <li> and they were really stiff and dry</li>
            <li> This is for sure fake!!</li>
            <li> what a difference a little pink sponge</li>
            <li> The product works extremely well for make-up application however, I have used it for less than a week</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this often results in a yucky pancake effect over the concealed areas, and achieving even looking coverage is a real pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it took me so long to try these out.  </li>
            <li> I found the beauty blender to be average, not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so not going back, at least not for liquid make-up.</li>
            <li> It is not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does seem to absorb the foundation</li>
            <li> This makes me wonder if I received a real and a fake.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> I read people had trouble with the pink bleeding onto their skin and it crumbling.</li>
            <li> Down side, w/ the pump the cleaner spills over everywhere</li>
            <li> At twenty bucks for one sponge, it is pricey, but I went for it, but keeping my expectation level down.</li>
            <li> i had to water down the cleanser a bit.</li>
            <li> Once i watered it down it cleans up licky split.</li>
            <li> Now, I have to use my finger nails and push down on the outer rim of the smallll litttle circle.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS use them wet!!</li>
            <li> its easy to use and blends the base extremely well.</li>
            <li> So obsessed with my new beauty blender!</li>
            <li> when one bottle typically lasts me 6 months.</li>
            <li> This is not your typical makeup</li>
            <li> Like the instructions say, this product works well when slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> As stated in previous reviews it is a compact sponge when you take it out of the package but rapidly doubles in size when you soak it and squeeze out the excess water.  </li>
            <li> helps me use less makeup.</li>
            <li> , I feel it smells a bit odd when out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The amount I would save regardless is still less than</li>
            <li> so I came to Amazon to purchase the set with the cleaner for 2 times less</li>
            <li> I used a lot less foundation</li>
            <li> I admit I was expecting less.</li>
            <li> maybe just under my eyes, but half the time not even that.</li>
            <li> and I use less liquid foundation</li>
            <li> I think using the Beautyblender sponge you use less foundation than a brush</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s dirty and I&#x27;m ready to put make up on, I dab a little cleaner on and get it wet.</li>
            <li> This is my first disappointment as a longtime Prime customer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However with drier foundations (for summertime, I usually use oil-free), it can be harder to get the foundation off of the Beautyblender and onto your face.</li>
            <li> They are TINY&amp;#62; Not true to picture.</li>
            <li> but it just made a mess.</li>
            <li> For me, the BB fails to live up to its hype.</li>
            <li> I have terribly acne-prone skin, and while I love my Bare Minerals, I&#x27;ve had a hard time with the brushes breaking me out.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> This little sponge just does wonders.</li>
            <li> These Beauty Blenders ripped after just 5 usages and they are definitely no worth the price!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how these little guys blend so well, but they provide even,</li>
            <li> One of my sponges did get a little rip in them already</li>
            <li> Never used a blending sponge before, so I was a little reluctant to buy this.  </li>
            <li> The sponges seem to be a little worn out now</li>
            <li> harsh lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> few notes about using the cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t cleaned it in a few days you might need to repeat a few times, but eventually the makeup will all come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and stopped using my stippling brush for foundation.</li>
            <li> Brushes can leave streaking and uneven coverage</li>
            <li> The cleanser was a waste of money though.</li>
            <li> I was a lil heavy on the soap</li>
            <li> I have been buying the beauty blender for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Up until a few months ago I never knew what a beauty blender was.i used to use my fingers to blend my foundation.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them everyday, but I do wash them every use.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about brush strokes or an uneven finish.</li>
            <li> I watched a few You tube tutorials, and decided I should buy one.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what I was missing.  </li>
            <li> It looks like you are not wearing any foundation, even if you have to use a heavy concealer.</li>
            <li> and I bought a few no name brands</li>
            <li> I can just pick some up on the sponge or put it on my face in a few dots and spread out with the blender.  </li>
            <li> after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> plus it doesn&#x27;t feel or look so heavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Unlike the brush this does not leave your skin feeling so heavy.</li>
            <li> GET THE CLEANSER KIT SINCE ITS HARD TO WASH IT WITHOUT IT OR WITH OTHER STUFF..</li>
            <li> Let it dry dirty then wash before the next use</li>
            <li> What annoyed me is that mine didn&#x27;t come with the plastic stand to dry the sponge on.</li>
            <li> These little sponges are a miracle for makeup application!</li>
            <li> For a few years now I&#x27;ve been trying to find a foundation that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;ve caked stuff on (which basically rules out all compact-style foundations) and that matches my very pale skin tone (which rules out a lot of others).  </li>
            <li> You need very little foundation with this method...</li>
            <li> I had avoided liquid foundation as an adult because of horrible memories from high school of looking spackled instead of dewy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the small ones.  </li>
            <li> I did have to go over one or two of the darker spots with a small brush, but using the \\&quot;stippling\\&quot; motion to blend everything worked well without sacrificing coverage.</li>
            <li> and the small pointed end</li>
            <li> I have been reading that they will do that if you don&#x27;t take care of them! :/</li>
            <li> I bought the sigma 100 dollar makeup brush kit and do not even use it no more becuse of the beuty blender</li>
            <li> No more streaky make up, everything is blended well...</li>
            <li> They were small and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> Tried some sponges in the past but nothing beats this.</li>
            <li> and I try to extend  the use past 3 months.</li>
            <li> sponges were too small</li>
            <li> Though, I did read somewhere that hotel or dollar store soap works just as well, if not better, than the soap that is sold with the sponges.</li>
            <li> A Beauty blender usually costs $20 for just one.</li>
            <li> However mine fell apart after a few uses!</li>
            <li> These ones seem small.</li>
            <li> This is not authentic.</li>
            <li> and I know my expensive foundation will stay with me longer until I finally run out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item 3 or four times, each time I got the same item and each time the item was wrong, it is suppose to have a spray unit in it</li>
            <li> and I hadn&#x27;t had any problems before :/</li>
            <li> I have used the small make-up sponges that you can get anywhere and never thought I&#x27;d like using a sponge.</li>
            <li> The cleanser definitely is no better that just squirting on hand soap on a sponge.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Beauty Blender for a few years now and I cannot do my makeup without it!</li>
            <li> The bottle is stiff and it&#x27;s hard to squeeze the cleanser out.</li>
            <li> Sorry this review is so long (and probably boring), but when you&#x27;ve tried as many different (and almost invariably disappointing) types of makeup and applicators as I have it always comes as a shock to find a product that works as well as it says it does.</li>
            <li> But I can say that after using and being disappointed by these sponges for a week I had to go out and get my trusty Real Techniques sponge again.</li>
            <li> then they both started to form a hard spot on the bottom.</li>
            <li> At least, for me they were.</li>
            <li> I hated the streaks and lines left by foundation brushes and tried stippling brushes but didn&#x27;t lake the cakey finish it left me with.     </li>
            <li> However, the color does not go on your face when blending or at least I didn&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it sucks.</li>
            <li> It sucks all the foundation on the sponge.</li>
            <li> The tip of the sponge is already starting to break down a bit :(</li>
            <li> You are supposed to apply the soap on the sponge while it&#x27;s dry, work the soap into the spots that are dirty, then rinse under water squeezing the soap out until there is no more soap.</li>
            <li> , so you may also want to shop around a bit before making this small investment!</li>
            <li> However, these items are WAY, and I mean WAY overpriced.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of getting this from anywhere other than beauty blenders website or Sephora just because of all the knock offs.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t noticed any differences from the scratches (I&#x27;m not sure what you would call them!)</li>
            <li> This is the only way ill ever apply my make-up ever again!</li>
            <li> This is too expensive and not really worth it.</li>
            <li> It seems ridiculous because it&#x27;s just a sponge</li>
            <li> it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> The sponge I&#x27;m using now also gets discolored from usage, but it&#x27;s less expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I was contemplating for quite sometime if I should get this since the price is a tad bit ridiculous for a sponge, but I had to see what the hype was about.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was a little skeptical of buying this at first because I thought that it was an insane price for a sponge.</li>
            <li> It started with a tiny tear at the wide base and then just started to crumble!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if its fake</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because I usually use sponges for makeup application</li>
            <li> Pretty shocking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this happen, I&#x27;m not sure if they we&#x27;re fake or just a defect.  </li>
            <li> I had, at some point in the past, bought a M.A.C concealer brush, but it just caked it on and gave a weird texture, so I reverted to using my fingers.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed, because the last BB lasted me for months.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to it at sephora and hated myself for paying 20+ dollars for a make up &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; but after the first use I was addicted!  </li>
            <li> MAKEUP IS NOT CHEAP!!!</li>
            <li> But desperate times call for desperate measures, and I figured that even if the sponges were crap that I could use the cleaner on my huge brush collection.     </li>
            <li> While for some it may allow for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look, I prefer my product not to be sheered out as it causes unnecessary layers to get medium/full coverage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.  </li>
            <li> No happy with this</li>
            <li> Product came broken I was unable to contact seller...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad set or what.</li>
            <li> Considering how much I hate using the typical wedge sponges that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> The cleanser can be a little annoying to work into a lather or to get out of the sponge on those mornings you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using expensive items, this is not cost efficient in terms of use.</li>
            <li> but I think the sponge MIGHT be fake.</li>
            <li> Before you purchase you need to know this is 100% FAKE.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with these at all.</li>
            <li> and no I didn&#x27;t not get a fake.</li>
            <li> I have never bought the sponges by themselves because they are too expensive.</li>
            <li> Just too expensive wait and get w points.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just using it wrong</li>
            <li> The product is fake and I believe the reviews are also.</li>
            <li> FAKE.</li>
            <li> The ones I got were fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this sponge caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really difficult to get the product onto the sponge.</li>
            <li> I have tried every newfangled way of applying it: from expensive foundation brushes, all types of sponges and of course, my fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything--sponges, fingers, expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> Had a fake Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE!&lt;br /&gt;NEVER</li>
            <li> I had tried the expensive foundation paint brush</li>
            <li> I bought this and a Beauty Blender from Sephora, since I read a bunch of reviews saying this was a fake.  </li>
            <li> and I was WRONG.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I have to give it one star because it&#x27;s fake..</li>
            <li> When you apply foundation on the fake one...</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately I accidentally ripped off the pointed tip.  </li>
            <li> Will not buy again, just too expensive</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed that in the description it DOES NOT tell you this will be the small blenders.</li>
            <li> Not a happy customer :(</li>
            <li> I do use cold water as directed on the package when cleaning mine though.</li>
            <li> I do use cold water as directed on the package when cleaning mine though.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel dirty).  </li>
            <li> My disappointment is with the cleanser dispenser.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like getting the tip dirty.</li>
            <li> As with anything, the tool gets dirty and needs to be cleaned.</li>
            <li> And my hands aren&#x27;t getting dirty with every makeup application.</li>
            <li> FAKE!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s too expensive!</li>
            <li> Well boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m addicted to this product!!</li>
            <li> and I feel wasting some of the very expensive cleaner.</li>
            <li> could not say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> but it always came out streaky and looked bad.  </li>
            <li> The price may seem steep, but when you think about the fact that it&#x27;s washable &amp; reusable, it&#x27;s not so bad.  </li>
            <li> too bad it smells a bit like my grandmother, though.</li>
            <li> Ever since i started using beauty blender, i feel bad leaving my brush alone:</li>
            <li> must add that I was a bit shocked by the size.</li>
            <li> They were so shocked</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed</li>
            <li> i plan on purchasing another beauty blender sponge soon, (dog got ahold of it :( )</li>
            <li> is probably also going into my pores and causing my breakouts :(</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you use this makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> Bought knockoffs that lasted longer :(</li>
            <li> I felt like a dirty bird, let me tell you!</li>
            <li> Unhappy!</li>
            <li> before using this piece of crap rip off one  </li>
            <li> this product makes liquid base application a breeze.</li>
            <li> I hate the way they become so discolored from use and everything about them just feels &amp;#34;not fresh&amp;#34; to me.</li>
            <li> I either got a bad set or these are just not what they used to be!</li>
            <li> I was very frustrated with the look of my foundation.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because I thought I was getting something else.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> The price seems outrageous for just a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> Also the sponge cleaner smells terrible!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I use it every time i need to put base on or even concealer, it makes it look like your makeup is effortless!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FAKE!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What can I say about this item? Hmmm. It&#x27;s created such a craze but after a months use I still haven&#x27;t found it to be a NECESSITY in your makeup stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the claims, I&#x27;ve found that the beauty blender eats product. If you&#x27;re using expensive items, this is not cost efficient in terms of use. My hands down favorite use for this is to apply loose powder and I&#x27;ve even quickly gone through a quarter of that when one bottle typically lasts me 6 months. I&#x27;ve noticed with liquid products, it&#x27;s best to apply on your face and blend with BB. I&#x27;ve seen tutorials apply directly to the BB and in all my experiments the BB eats up some of the product. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger issue that I have is the fact that I like a med-full coverage look. I&#x27;ve found that the BB thins out product to look a step down from what it should (med cov items look like light cov and so forth). While for some it may allow for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look, I prefer my product not to be sheered out as it causes unnecessary layers to get medium/full coverage effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I DO like about this product is for use for MUA&#x27;s or other professionals. It&#x27;s used wet and easy to clean after each client with access to water terminal of some sort. As I mentioned above, it&#x27;s done the best job at applying powder products for me by leaving a smooth and silky finish instead of a chalky looking one.  The shape of it is also great, it allows you to use various angles to target large, small or hard to get to areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cleanser, I like it but I can&#x27;t say that it would make a huge difference than using something gentle like baby wash. Stains can be hard to remove but usually come out well with VERY hot water. I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s best to clean when it&#x27;s dry and start by massaging in the cleanser or the dry BB before adding water and massaging to clean. It&#x27;s also important to note to be considerably gentle. I softly went in with the front of my nail to try and force out astain and noticed a small rip in it the next day. Recommended to clean with massaging only fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I see this as a great product for those who are professionals or everyday people who enjoy a light natural coverage with very little effort. Contour queens may enjoy using this as well to blend in harsh lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I probably wouldn&#x27;t personally repurchase without trying a cheaper generic version. For me, the BB fails to live up to its hype.</li>
            <li> LOVE these!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes they are the authentic, real beautyblenders and they are fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is amazing too, it really does clean the beautyblenders better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve tried. I find I get the best results when I clean the beautyblender after each use and let it completely air dry before the next use.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this cleanser to clean all of my other makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;And you can&#x27;t beat this price when a single beautyblender sells for $20 at sephora :)</li>
            <li> good stuff, just the box is poor packaged, and the liquid leak all over the box when I got it.</li>
            <li> Every good thing I&#x27;ve ever heard about the beauty blender is completely 100% true it applies the make up flawlessly it makes you just have the most beautiful finish and boosts your confidence you never have to worry about your make up being noticeable or cakey it just evenly  blends it out it&#x27;s indescribable you have to try it to believe it!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do my makeup without these!</li>
            <li> The company I got it from I give a 5 star but the product itself is a 3. I waited to get this product for a while and finally decided to get it and when o used it, it used more product then my brush or hand and really had to same look afterwards. Idk it wasn&#x27;t all that it was hyped up to be.</li>
            <li> Works really good love it👍</li>
            <li> I get it. The price seems outrageous for just a makeup sponge. I mean, you&#x27;re getting along just fine with your brushes and fingers, right? No, you&#x27;re not. You need the BB.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this buy makes more sense for makeup geeks that have a daily contour and cat eye routine rather than those that are less intense about their beauty routine. If your makeup routine is some tinted moisturizer and mascara, you may not get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;Still, this is a great little tool to have. Once you get it, you will never go back and you will wonder how you got along without it.&lt;br /&gt;My makeup blends so much better but I also have better coverage since the sponge doesn&#x27;t absorb much product. My boyfriend even commented about how nice my makeup looked and that kid is clueless!</li>
            <li> I love the BeautyBlender.. do not waste your money on &#x27;dupes&#x27; - none truly compare to the original.. Also, for the first year I started using the beautyblender - I refused to buy the BeautyBlender cleanser.. then I got a sample of it and realized that it is necessary.. It will get your beautyblender super clean AND it will prolong the life of your beautyblender.. also - if you use the cleanser strictly for your sponge -- then it will last awhile.. (I made the mistake of cleaning my cosmetics brushes -- and while it did a great job of cleaning them - it also ate up the product)..</li>
            <li> The cleaner was good but I think the sponge MIGHT be fake. The one I got from Sephora was wayyy bigger and had a different texture. I am not sure if its fake but it just felt different than the one from sephora. I am not going to be buying this again. I used the two sponges so didn&#x27;t have to throw them away but... I felt like it was just like using a regular sponge.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these!! They are the BEST sponge you can get for makeup application!! REMEMBER - ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS use them wet!! (NOT dripping wet, ring the water out... ok just read the package and follow the instructions) This is also AWESOME because it came with the soap to clean them with... AGAIN... use the soap that is made for the Beauty Blender ONLY!! Other soaps will cause the sponge to fall apart,and rip, etc.... these will last a long time if they are properly cared for as well!!!!</li>
            <li> Love these sponges.  I bought these for Christmas presents for my girls.  It was on their list.  You need to get the real ones.  The knock offs don&#x27;t last nearly as long and don&#x27;t do as good a job.</li>
            <li> I hesitated for months before buying this item because I thought how could a sponge be worth that much $??? But people, it is! It is worth it alone in how much less foundation I&#x27;m going through. The flawless finish it creates is an extra bonus. I&#x27;d definitely buy the soap, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I ever applied foundation and concealer before the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an ok product. I honestly like my brushes better. And it blows me away that a sponge needs a special cleaner, albeit it can also wash your brushes, but it literally smells like the same brush cleaner CVS brand $5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I agree with all the hype about this, but it&#x27;s not bad. I use it occasionally with my foundation</li>
            <li> Sponge itself is amazing - my fave for even makeup application. However, these were smaller than my last ones. It didn&#x27;t say they were mini, but they&#x27;re pretty dang small. Other than that, fantastic sponge!</li>
            <li> I love it! Is a really good sponge.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd set of double Beautyblenders I&#x27;ve bought. I&#x27;ve bought a set through Sephora, but I like the convenience of ordering through Amazon because of Amazon Prime. I use the Beautyblender on a daily basis and I find that I use less foundation than I would with a foundation brush. It also applies the foundation flawlessly and camouflages my acne scarring and blemishes. I also love that it&#x27;s easy to create a transition between the makeup on my face and my neck, without applying makeup all the way down my neck. This product is easy to clean and I like the cleanser, but I must admit that I use it with my Cetaphil daily cleanser to clean my sponges.</li>
            <li> FAKE! I purchased an authentic Original Beauty Blender from Sephora and I was looking to replace it. The items sent to me were a completely different size when the sponges were both dry and wet. Also, both sponges have these rings around it as though a machine just freshly shaved them. The  authentic Original Beauty Blender did not have these rings. I am extremely disappointed. Will be sending back and repurchase from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Very excited! Items arrived quicker then expected! Used the liquid cleaner on my cosmetic brushes and they came clean! Great buy!!</li>
            <li> Wow! I was really hesitant to buy this since it is a bit pricey, but it is definitely leaps and bounds better than the regular make up sponges. It makes my foundation (drugstore) look absolutely smooth and perfect. I feel like it does a great job of filling in the pores to give a more smooth finish. Only downside is cleaning it. The sponge totally soaks up a lot of the product (not as much as other sponges) so cleaning it can take a while. It definitely takes more time compared to cleaning brushes. On a side note, the cleanser works great to clean brushes too.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because I usually use sponges for makeup application and I didn&#x27;t think that this product would be any different from the disposable sponges that I usually get. I definitely think that this product is a great investment and it&#x27;ll definitely save you some money if you currently use disposable sponges! The cleanser is also amazing!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rate this a 5 because looking at this item you would think it was the big blenders and after receiving them in the mail it&#x27;s the small ones.  I was very disappointed because I thought I was getting something else.</li>
            <li> one blender seems different than the other but both work the exact same so no complaints! such a great deal.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best makeup sponge i have ever used, and being a pro makeup artist i have used allot! foundation goes on smooth and looks really natural, pointed end is great for under the eyes and around the nose! The cleaner is great too, i also clean my brushes with it, takes lipstick and other oily products off like a dream!</li>
            <li> This is a must have! I love this product. I wish I would have dicovered it sooner. It makes my foundation look flawless! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I saw Youtube Gurus rave about this product and how effectively it blended foundations, concealer and creams.I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try.All i can say its an amazing product.My foundation looked flawless like a make up artist had done my make up.Only downside is that it stains, so make sure you clean it often.</li>
            <li> This is the sponge for you if you feel that your make-up goes on that much better using one.  It is designed right, and easy to use.  The cleanser is wonderful and the sponge truly comes clean.  I am not giving it 5 stars due to the price...I think it is high.</li>
            <li> This is my first review, but I was so pleasantly surprised by how well this product works that I had to leave some feedback. After having perfect skin for years, my face suddenly went berserk on me in my mid-twenties and nothing I&#x27;ve tried has stopped the breakouts or scarring. So I&#x27;ve been forced to become a major makeup consumer and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for anything to make my life easier in the makeup department. I prefer mineral makeup to liquid, and the only way I&#x27;ve found to get adequate coverage is to start with a thick creme concealer (like dermablend) on the blemishes, then go over my whole face with a mineral foundation. Unfortunately this often results in a yucky pancake effect over the concealed areas, and achieving even looking coverage is a real pain. But it&#x27;s still the best method I&#x27;ve found so far, since an all creme/liquid approach leaves me looking like a geisha and the all mineral \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; action tends to buff away any concealing effect and defeat the purpose. So you can see why I&#x27;m always on the lookout for anything that might help. Also it is a pain in the butt to keep all of those brushes clean.    So after trying just about all of the brushes on the market I turned to these sponges out of curiosity. I had high hopes but low expectations, as they seemed pretty gimmicky. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and I figured that even if the sponges were crap that I could use the cleaner on my huge brush collection.     Even though they seemed like they would only be good to use with liquid foundation, I decided to try using them with the mineral foundation first just for the heck of it. Dampened the sponge as suggested (it bloated up rather alarmingly) and sat down at the makeup table expecting a steep learning curve. First I used the pointy end to apply and blend the creme concealer with surprisingly good results. I did have to go over one or two of the darker spots with a small brush, but using the \\&quot;stippling\\&quot; motion to blend everything worked well without sacrificing coverage. So far so good. Now for the moment of truth-applying the powder foundation. Usually this involves several minutes of patting, gentle buffing, blending, patting again to replace the coverage that was lost from the buffing, etc. Not with this baby. It took maybe a minute of \\&quot;stippling\\&quot; to get an even, non-cakey finish. I probably used half as much product as usual, and there wasn&#x27;t a huge powdery mess on the table. Pretty shocking. I couldn&#x27;t believe it was that easy, so I went to check it out in a variety of different lighting, convinced that there must be some streak or blob somewhere that needed fixing. Nope, looks great. I was sold, even used the pointy end to clean up an eye makeup oops without messing up my foundation.    I was ready to post this review then and there, but decided to try out the cleanser first so I could include it. I don&#x27;t know what the complaints are about, the dispenser worked fine and the sponge cleaned up easily. The lavender smell is a bonus, very nice. Part of the reason it was so easy to clean is that the sponge absorbed almost no product, so everything was just on the surface. Of course I only tried it with powder, it may soak up more liquid foundation. It seems designed to keep the product on the outside, so you don&#x27;t lose as much foundation (and $$$) by having it sucked into a sponge.     Sorry this review is so long (and probably boring), but when you&#x27;ve tried as many different (and almost invariably disappointing) types of makeup and applicators as I have it always comes as a shock to find a product that works as well as it says it does. This is one. The only caveat is that since I&#x27;ve only used it once I can&#x27;t vouch for its durability yet, but it claims on the package to last for 3 months. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Good deal perfect for my skin. They are authentic and boy I was messing alot before I decided to buy them. They are magic blender . do as instructed and have a smooth makeup look no smudge no nothing</li>
            <li> This sponge is the best one I have ever used. It is great for blending concealer, and especially for blending around areas like your nose or eyes. I originally read about it in a magazine, and pre-ordered it from amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. The price point is a little intimidating, but after having used it for a few months, I believe the excellent quality makes it a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes about using the cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is dispensed from the bottle by gently pushing the sponge down on the pedestal (exactly like the picture, you just push down and a small amount of cleanser is dispensed directly on to the sponge. Although generally I wouldn&#x27;t buy cleanser this expensive, I am happy that I have it. It has a very light lavender fragrance and is gentle and soy-based. You don&#x27;t need very much (about the size of a dime, which is what is dispensed if you use the bottle as directed) if you are cleaning your sponge on a regular basis. If you haven&#x27;t cleaned it in a few days you might need to repeat a few times, but eventually the makeup will all come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this sponge and will be buying more as gifts for friends and family. I would recommend buying the 2-pack if purchasing from amazon, as it&#x27;s a better value, and you&#x27;ll have an extra one for travel, or to alternate between the sponges if you don&#x27;t feel like cleaning them all the time! I did notice that the beautyblender website sells this sponge &amp; cleanser combination for a lower price than amazon (plus shipping though), so you may also want to shop around a bit before making this small investment!</li>
            <li> Love it , which I knew about this product sooner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product for the second time. It makes my foundation more natural and soft. The cleanser also so useful. It cleans the sponge easily.</li>
            <li> amazing for applying make up</li>
            <li> While a little expensive, the Beautyblender offers great coverage for makeup. The cleaner is easy to use and smells great.</li>
            <li> I have been on the fence about the BeautyBlender for months. I had watched countless YouTube reviews, and read tons of reviews on various sites. I kept thinking that surely this little pink sponge couldn&#x27;t be THAT great, and I thought the price seemed a little crazy for just a simple little sponge and some cleanser. Finally I broke down and got myself the kit with two sponges and the 5oz cleanser, using an Amazon gift card I had. I am pleased to say that I was so wrong in regards to this product. This little sponge is absolutely amazing! I normally apply my liquid foundation with my fingers, and oftentimes it has left me with a slightly uneven finish that I end up having to touch up to try to even it out. I no longer have this issue with the BeautyBlender. My makeup goes on perfectly every time, and I think it actually takes me LESS time using this BeautyBlender than it took me when I was using my fingers to apply my foundation. The BeautyBlender is so easy to use. It can give anyone professional-looking results, even if you&#x27;re like me and are far from being considered a makeup artist. I put a dab of foundation on each area of my face with my middle finger, then I take the slightly damp BeautyBlender and bounce it all over my face. It only takes a couple minutes to have a flawless, airbrushed-looking foundation finish. I love how the BeautyBlender has the large end and the small pointed end; it&#x27;s super easy to get into small corners around your nose/eyes with the small end. I still apply my pressed powder with the regular puff it comes with, because I need a fair amount of powder on top due to my oily skin. I don&#x27;t ever have a problem getting my powder on smoothly anyway; it&#x27;s always been the foundation that has given me a little bit of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the cleanser that comes with the BeautyBlender too. It&#x27;s super easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t take much at all to get the BeautyBlender clean again. I have not really noticed a lot of pink water coming out when cleaning my BeautyBlender (I saw some other reviewers had mentioned this). I do use cold water as directed on the package when cleaning mine though. I would think warm or hot water could certainly cause more color loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been absolutely amazed at the results I&#x27;ve gotten from this little sponge. For me, the results well outweigh the initial cost! Not to mention, this is not a one-time-use throw-away item; you can use the same BeautyBlender for up to 6 months. I think on a cost-per-use basis, it&#x27;s actually an excellent deal and this product is definitely NOT a gimmick. It truly does do everything it claims to do. I&#x27;ve never been happier with how my makeup looks, thanks to this little pink sponge. I know this is one product that I will never be without again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested in the blue sponge that can be found at Target, be aware that the foam material used to make it is more dense and it does not \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; on your face quite as well. I don&#x27;t even intend on trying one of those at all, because I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my BeautyBlender in every aspect.aning my BeautyBlender (I saw some other reviewers had mentioned this).

            <li> I love this sponge.  I use it with my foundation stick and it delivers amazing results.  It&#x27;s also super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product, I looked up and watched reviews on youtube and various other sites. Many people have said that the color runs. Before I used mine the first time, I washed my sponge with the included Blender Cleaner under hot water, and it didn&#x27;t run at all. It wasn&#x27;t until after I used it, and used the cleaner that I noticed the running that people talked about. It made the foundation that I washed out look a bit bright pink. That said, I really like this sponge. I&#x27;ve never used a sponge before for foundation. I had only previously used either my fingers (pretty uneven application, and it would kind of sit on top of my face and look pretty gross), or a foundation brush (even application, but you had to use a lot and I really didn&#x27;t like it. It made my skin feel dirty).  Pros:  -Very even application  -You don&#x27;t need that much foundation  -It doesn&#x27;t look obvious that you&#x27;re wearing foundation at all. It made my skin look naturally flawless, instead of making the foundation sit on top of it and get dry looking  -Very easy to use quickly  -Pointy end is perfect for around your nose and eyes  -Soft, feels great and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin  Cons:  -Difficult to clean. The Blender Cleaner doesn&#x27;t lather up very well, and it&#x27;s hard to work it in well with the sponge. Cleaning actually ends up taking longer than application  -Stains. No matter how hard you try, I can guarantee that there will be some sort of stain on your sponge after your first use.  -Takes a while to dry. In a well ventilated place, it&#x27;s all right, but it&#x27;s good to keep in mind that you don&#x27;t want it to stay wet too long, or it will mildew. Another reason to make sure to clean your blender regularly!  I have tried this with a face primer and without. Without a face primer, make up looks great and lasts for a long time (about 4 to 5 hours for me). With the face primer, my foundation lasted all day (I even went out dancing one evening and my foundation still looked great at the end of the night!).  A note: The description for this product states that you will receive 2 blenders, 1 cleanser, a carrying pouch, a sample of the cleanser, and instruction cards. My package only came with 2 blenders, 1 cleanser, and instruction cards. I did not receive the sample or carrying pouch. This might vary from seller to seller- I bought mine from Amazon LLC.  EDIT 2/18/12  I figured out how to get the beauty blender completely clean! I&#x27;ve been doing this for about a month now, and it consistently cleans the blender perfectly. Instead of washing after use, I let it dry dirty and wash right before use. Put the cleaner on the sponge while it&#x27;s dry, and rub it in with your hands. Then, under warm water, just splash a tiny bit of water on it, and work it in. Then, get it real nice and soaked and get all the soap out and all the color should come out and your sponge will look like new again!</li>
            <li> I Love love loveee the beauty blender. If you&#x27;re like me and ever wondered how a sponge could make you look flawless, it really works!&lt;br /&gt;Rating only 4 starts because the sponge cleaner smells like ginger and I don&#x27;t really like that. However, it does clean really well!</li>
            <li> The best deal for beauty blenders iv ever found. The product is fantastic and the cleanser works like a dream.</li>
            <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t know if it is really worth the $$$ you can find similar sponges that work just as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m super paranoid that it will mold. I have been reading that they will do that if you don&#x27;t take care of them! :/</li>
            <li> This is for sure fake!! My friend was using her REAL beauty blender from sephora on me...before using this piece of crap rip off one  She tried to wet mine and it didn&#x27;t absorb the water and puff up all the way like the real one does. Plus it doesn&#x27;t apply foundation evenly. I&#x27;m pissed</li>
            <li> I love the beauty blender.. it goes on so smooth and perfect blend!!! It gives me the perfect coverage and give the airbrush finish look. The cleaner is the best cleaner I have ever used. It cleans in no time and I used it for all my makeup brushes and works like a charm. I would definitely spend the money and get this product</li>
            <li> The blenders are the best, but I think any mild soap would do for washing them.  However, the container is great and offers a great way to dry the blenders.  I think I will refill the empty container with a mild liquid soap.</li>
            <li> this beuty blender is amazing!!! it leaves my makeup flawlees, It comes with the cleaner so it helps with not having to buy a cleanser. I bought the sigma 100 dollar makeup brush kit and do not even use it no more becuse of the beuty blender</li>
            <li> Save your money or buy the real thing from Sephora or a well known store because this is not the authentic product... This one is longer, does not become as fluffy, and therefore it doesn&#x27;t work as good...I have owned many beautyblenders before and I know exactly how they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hesitant to buy the Beauty Blender because I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy a $20 makeup sponge. So I looked on Amazon for cheaper prices and I got lucky and found this package deal. 2 authentic Beauty Blenders plus the blender cleanser for $31? Couldn&#x27;t pass it up, such a great deal. Yes, these are the real deal. At least, for me they were. I wet 1 and it did double in size. They&#x27;re so soft and squishy and I can&#x27;t wait to use them 😊 thank you for a great product... P.S. Shipping was extremely fast. Got mine in 2 days 👍</li>
            <li> Great price for two, i really recommend this to anyone with a budget.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges with my BB cream. I think you do end up using more product but the finish is flawless. I was told you could use sulfate free shampoo but for the price on Amazon this kit was cheaper than buying 2 at my local beauty supply shop. The cleanser can be a little annoying to work into a lather or to get out of the sponge on those mornings you are in a rush. I&#x27;ve never perfected the concealer + foundation + highlighter look to cover up the sleepless bags under my eye with brushes or basic sponges until I tried the BeautyBlender.</li>
            <li> So obsessed with my new beauty blender! I was a little iffy about spending this much on a makeup sponge, but it was definitely worth the splurge! I was able to use this with my foundation, concealer, cream blush, even my Bare Minerals powder, and it really blended everything nicely. My face looks like its been airbrushed after using my beauty blender! It makes my makeup application process so much faster, the large end of the sponge lets me quickly blend my whole face and the smaller pointy end is helpful for using around my nose and for covering up my dark circles under my eyes. Definitely a must have!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m just now learning about the Beauty Blender! I first read about it on a make-up website I use and had been contemplating buying one for some time. I finally bit the bullet and bought the Beauty Blender 2 + Blender Cleanser combo and I love it!! It spreads my foundation evenly over my face and makes me look dewy. I no longer have make-up all over my hands after application. The sponge is easy to clean and the cleanser works on brushes too. Love this product will never be without again!</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast and I&#x27;m amazed how well the product works</li>
            <li> Everyone love the sponge, and I thought it worked well, but I&#x27;m not as taken with it as many others.&lt;br /&gt;My comments go mainly to the cleanser, which works very well. My disappointment is with the cleanser dispenser. I thought the dispenser would be easy to use but it is awkward to get the amount out that you want, and the dispenser gets makeup all over it from whatever sponge you are trying to clean. Then you have to rinse the dispenser off and I feel wasting some of the very expensive cleaner.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for liquid foundation and cream blushes. I also use it with my MAC paint pots if they are a little dry. I get even coverage and no little hairs from my brushes now that I use the blender only. This is not your typical makeup sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely wet the sponge before using and clean after every use. Mine is stained but I know it is clean when the water runs clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again in a heartbeat. :-)</li>
            <li> I could never apply foundation without that thing. It&#x27;s a life-saver.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge, and this is such a great deal for two of them and the cleaner. The actual beauty blender cleaner is the best cleaner I have used for the beauty blender. It takes out all the makeup and turns the sponge back to its bright pink color. The sponge is also wonderful. It makes your makeup go on so smoothly and naturally. It does not cake up and it blends out so nicely with this sponge. It does offer a more sheer coverage as opposed to a dense brush.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat this product.  I was a little weary at first but this is an amazing tool to have in your beauty arsenal.  I use the sponge during my entire make up routine and it works great to blend foundation, bronzer, eyeshadows, concealer- you name it.  Like the instructions say, this product works well when slightly damp.  It&#x27;s best to dab for larger areas (you don&#x27;t want to drag your skin anyways) and the smaller pointy tip is great for under eye concealer and for even smudging eyeshadows.  I use the cleanser when I&#x27;m finished and leave it to air dry and it&#x27;s all ready for the next use.  This is worth the money.  No more streaky make up, everything is blended well...this is far superior to any round makeup sponge you can buy at the drugstore.  This has many, many uses and will help you apply make up like a pro!</li>
            <li> im so excited on using the beauty blender. i have read several reviews and watched videos of people using it.... so i had to try it out is an amazing product i makes my makeup look so pretty i totaly love it</li>
            <li> Beauty Blender is the best ! Flawless application. The cleaner smells great, and the sponge feels great on your skin damp. So refreshing!!!</li>
            <li> This is soooo perfectt! i use it mostly for my under eye concealer and i LOVEEEEE it, Best thing that ever happened to my makeup/highlight.</li>
            <li> Takes me less time to put on my foundation and looks more natural.I will never put on my makeup without it.</li>
            <li> Before you purchase you need to know this is 100% FAKE. It&#x27;s completely different size, texture and results to the real thing. Amazon needs to stop the scam!</li>
            <li> I love these sponges they blend my make up so well it looks flawless especially my concealer .... So worth it..</li>
            <li> I love the beauty blender. It makes my makeup look very natural- it blends my makeup into the edges of my face so well that you cannot tell that I have any makeup on. I have received numerous compliments on the appearance of my foundation. I use my blender with Tom Ford or Chanel foundation.</li>
            <li> Best deal ever!!!! I posted on my Instagram to let everyone know. Beauty Blenders are the best makeup tool ever!!! I can&#x27;t live without them. I was so excited for this deal!</li>
            <li> A great buy, it came really fast I love the beauty blender</li>
            <li> Affordable price comparing it to beauty blender website because one beauty blender costs $20 each and the cleanser is $15 so you get more than what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Soo much hype over these beauty blenders I refused to buy it and only bought the look-a-like cheap kinds. Finally, i thought what the heck, let me try it. I did, and now i want to hype it up. Idk how they do it, but the sponge isnt a regular sponge, It feels and works professionally. I use it everyday and stopped using my stippling brush for foundation. I use it for concealer, foundation and powder! Damp or dry. Perfect to take on vacations because you dont need your foundation, concealer or setting powder brush!!... this truly is something to rave about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the single at first and then the double so I can have one dry, one damp and for powder. LOVE!</li>
            <li> ...it&#x27;s everything it said it would be</li>
            <li> I was soooo excited about these, thinking they were the holy grail of makeup application. If you have acne, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money, no matter how hard I try to get a good full coverage using the beauty blender, it just doesn&#x27;t work out. If you have good skin, this would be awesome. But I don&#x27;t. So I&#x27;ll stick with my foundation brushes!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t imagine how you ever put on your makeup before this !</li>
            <li> This beauty sponge is much more durable than any other that I had previously used.  Great for blending countour and highlights.  The cleanser works great on my brushes as well.</li>
            <li> I bought the beautyblender due to all the good reviews on youtube.  I personally preferred regular sponges. Unless I dont know how to  use this, even though I&#x27;ve watch videos that shows you how to use it.  And it&#x27;s too expensive! Not worth it!</li>
            <li> Beautyblenders allow the most flawless foundation coverage possible.  I&#x27;ve used all kinds of high end brushes and I always come back to my BB.  Brushes can leave streaking and uneven coverage but beautyblenders don&#x27;t and you can build coverage so perfectly without your skin looking too covers in product.  Washing it once a week or so keeps it fresh and they geberally last me six months or longer.  You can also use them for concealer and skin care products.  I have a few in rotation for different products!</li>
            <li> I like this sponge better than the Sonia Kashuk. It&#x27;s very soft and \\&quot;bouncy\\&quot; and I think it applies my liquid foundation very well. I also like the narrow soft end for applying concealer. I have not had the problem that some other customers have had with the pink dye &#x27;running&#x27; when I wash it, and the cleanser seemed to clean the sponge well. However, these items are WAY, and I mean WAY overpriced. But, I guess I knew that when I ordered them. I had heard a lot of good reviews and wanted to try it. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll order any more unless the price comes down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The Beautyblender did begin to \\&quot;bleed pink\\&quot; soon after I posted my review, and does every time I clean it.  However, it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much (but something to consider if you have sensitive skin). I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and just really like it a lot. My foundation looks great with no streaking. As suggested, I wet the Beautyblender, squeeze out the excess water in my hands then gently in a towel. Then I tap the bottom part of the blender in my foundation and I \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; it on my face, repeating until it&#x27;s all applied. I also use the tip to apply the foundation around my nose and eyelids. Love the cleanser too. I tried cleaning the Beautyblender with other cheaper products and it just didn&#x27;t &#x27;come clean&#x27; as well as when I used the cleanser. I also use it to clean my makeup brushes. I still think the products are over priced, but I will buy them again because of the way it applies my makeup--darn near flawless.</li>
            <li> I bought these over a year ago, and I still use them. It seems ridiculous because it&#x27;s just a sponge but it&#x27;s really fast and beautiful application of foundation. The cleanser was a waste of money though. I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s tea tree oil soap instead.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to applying makeup with brushes or cheap sponges.  I feel like I get more coverage with less product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more involved but I&#x27;m enjoying my BeautyBlender. I find I use less product and get a better finish. Considering how much I hate using the typical wedge sponges that&#x27;s saying something. This set (with the cleanser)was only $3 than the set without...so I&#x27;d say it was definitely worth it. The cleanser works well and does remove all the product. The scent is mild and pleasant.    I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Since I own these cute sponges, I hardly reach for my foundation brushes. It gives me a smooth and airbrush finish in less than 2 minutes. I also like the cleanser that comes in the set. I use it to clean my makeup brushes and it works effectively. It makes the bristles clean, soft and smell nice.</li>
            <li> I received my beauty blender sponges today and I am so pleased.  As stated in previous reviews it is a compact sponge when you take it out of the package but rapidly doubles in size when you soak it and squeeze out the excess water.  Despite the fact that I was not going out at the time of receipt, I decided that I would try it anyway to apply some foundation and was amazed with the results.  I have quite a lot of melasma spots on my face so I use thick full coverage makeup- Mac studio fix - and it went on beautifully.  The makeup looked so much more professional compared to the quality of my previous applications using a regular sponge, brush or my fingertips.  It was smooth and all my pores were filled in with no streaks or edges.  It is great for building up layers of foundation without looking cakey or pastey.  By simply bouncing the applicator on my face (stippling) the makeup is applied flawlessly without soaking into the sponge and my pores are nicely filled in.  It feels cool on my skin because it is damp and this may also be the reason why it does not soak up a lot makeup as the pores in the sponge are already filled with water.  The pointed end applies makeup beautifully to tricky places like the corner of the nose or around the eyes.  Cleaning the sponge using the cleaner provided is a breeze.  It bleeds pink a little but all the makeup is removed with no staining, at least after the first use.  I do hope it continues along that trend.  Not quite sure how long the sponge will remain effective  so I will update this post as time goes by.  Subsequently, I used Dove body wash to clean the sponge and it works wonderfully with no  staining from the makeup.  I suppose any gentle body wash or makeup remover will clean it as well  I recommend this applicator although it is a bit pricey.  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Applies my foundation flawlessly without wasting it!! i will NEVER use a brush again to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> The sponge and brush cleanser is wonderful! It smells great and best of all it cleans my beauty blender and brushes with ease. Love it! About the beauty blender itself, I do not need it as much anymore. I use a non-latex sponge from  Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and it works great plus it is less expensive. I will keep buying this cleanser but not so sure about repurchasing the beauty blender as it has lost its hype.</li>
            <li> i love the beauty blender! i have tried the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; ones that they have on the market and they don&#x27;t hold a candle to the real deal. makes my makeup application so easy. it really helps blend and even all of my makeup. such a great product. the cleaner is also awesome as you can use it to clean all of your brushes not just the blender and its a large size cleaner as well. definately a lot of bang for your buck. my blenders also last me a good 6 months with proper care.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product at a great price!</li>
            <li> works amazing, however my cleaning soap bottle leaks, could of just been a badly made one, who knows. but it cleans the beauty blender and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Love it. could not say anything bad about it. I got a ton of use out of my beauty blender from sephora before I purchased these. The distributor has a  competitive price on them and they were delivered on time. gives me flawless skin everytime. helps me use less makeup. Gives a natural look I have tried atleast 10 knock-offs and none of them compare to the beautyblender.</li>
            <li> The best deal out there</li>
            <li> I purchased this because honestly, I have no idea how to apply makeup. With this wonderful little sponge, I can rest easy knowing I won&#x27;t get cake face or streak marks putting on foundation in the morning. It&#x27;s velvety smooth and it&#x27;s shape, albeit simple, is wonderfully designed. And it&#x27;s true that it won&#x27;t suck up all your foundation-when I clean it minimal amounts of product are washed away.  It&#x27;s probably just me, but I think the cleaner smells a bit funky when you use it out of the bottle. After the sponge dries I can smell the lavender, but I don&#x27;t know, I feel it smells a bit odd when out of the bottle. But it does it&#x27;s job extremely well, and I also use it to clean my brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought the product for my girlfriend and she loved it. She said its easier to apply  her make up. She says great product.</li>
            <li> I like the concept behind this sponge, but I&#x27;m not sure how much difference it made in the final look of my foundation.  I probably would have continued buying this sponge except that I could never get all the foundation out, even though I used the cleanser that came with the kit and followed directions.  The sponge I&#x27;m using now also gets discolored from usage, but it&#x27;s less expensive so I don&#x27;t mind so much when it&#x27;s time to throw it away.</li>
            <li> ordered this product after seeing a tutorial on youtube the make up artist applied here make up with that beauty blender which works great. she explained how to use it in the wet form but i guess there is a dry way of using it. I like applying my liquid foundation with it wet. the cleanser works great but i don&#x27;t think it takes all the make up out but I guess nothing can,,,,,,,, Im still on my first sponge I got two and I wash it after every use overall pretty happy with this product it&lt;br /&gt;I was gonna order the cheap version but my make up artist friend convinced me to get the original so I did so far I have no complains  :)</li>
            <li> The Blender sponges are great for applying makeup evenly and the cleanser is GREAT for the sponges AND any makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> Perfect beauty tool for flawless makeup application. Received mine earlier than expected and the cleaning soap was larger than expected. Overall great purchase for a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a day but I&#x27;m in love!! This is not a knock off and after getting it wet it doubled in size! It is worth every penny. I&#x27;m truly impressed, I never thought I&#x27;d love a sponge so much. However, I am going to need to practice with the cleaner. I haven&#x27;t had luck getting the color of the makeup off the sponge-smells great though!</li>
            <li> This product honestly revolutionized the way I do my makeup. Application is flawless, blended, and even, more so than my most expensive foundation brushes or sponges. An absolute must for anyone who uses liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> I have terribly acne-prone skin, and while I love my Bare Minerals, I&#x27;ve had a hard time with the brushes breaking me out. If I don&#x27;t clean them every single day, I&#x27;m sure to be left with blemishes. But the brushes are terribly inconvenient to clean, and need to dry overnight (sometimes longer). So I&#x27;ve been looking a while for a better option. I&#x27;ve tried cotton swabs, wedge sponges, and a million different other applicators, but none of them seemed to be compatible with BM.&lt;br /&gt;This product has finally ended my search. I love that it can be washed every single day, and I especially love that you can use it damp. So I can literally wash it right before I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d feel about using BM with a damp applicator, but honestly, I think it works wayyyyyy better. First off, you don&#x27;t end up with powder all over your clothes, the bathroom floor, etc... It all ends up on your face, which I&#x27;m sure is saving me on powder and subsequently $$.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the powder just seems to go on better when it&#x27;s damp! It&#x27;s much easier to get the coverage I need.&lt;br /&gt;Just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I am hooked!</li>
            <li> i have been using a beautyblender for awhile now and theres nothing like it, it leaves my face flawless and gives a dewy finish wich i love and the cleanser really does a great job with removing all the makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad set or what. I was not impressed with these at all. I used to use the beauty blender daily and exclusively. It was my holy grail. It could apply all my foundations flawlessly. But my wallet got thinner for a while there and I had to find and alternative. I started using the Real Techniques sponge and loved it. I had forgotten about the BB completely until I came across this awesome deal right here on Amazon. I had to splurge! I was so excited when it came to my door that I ripped open the box, tossed my RT sponge, and took off the makeup I was wearing so I could use this baby! But the second I took it out of the container I knew it wasn&#x27;t what I had remembered, but I used it anyway. Well, I was disappointed. It did about as good a job as those single use sponges you can get at any drugstore. These are not the BBs that I remember. Quality has definitely gone out the window. I can&#x27;t say anything about the cleanser because I never used it. But I can say that after using and being disappointed by these sponges for a week I had to go out and get my trusty Real Techniques sponge again. I either got a bad set or these are just not what they used to be!</li>
            <li> I used 5x the makeup while using this sponge.  It is not an economical way to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Would not use anything else to put foundation on!</li>
            <li> Super , I used when I put on my foundation and it is very helpful and I clean it is very perfect and make it as it new again I strongly recommended</li>
            <li> Excellent deal! The cleanser has worked great for both my beauty blenders and brushes. Smells really good too.</li>
            <li> If you already know different techniques like stippling and line buffing/blurring  then this will work for you or of the box. There are many uses but if you aren&#x27;t willing to experiment or learn then it might not be for you. However you can just use it as you would any other sponge as well. I suggest buying the cleaner they sell as well. This will not work if it&#x27;s dirty and to strong of a soap kills the sponge material.</li>
            <li> There is a reason why magazines, makeup artists, YouTube beauty gurus and regular folks are raving about the beauty blender...because it actually delivers what it promises...beautifully blended foundation that is actually easy to do and rather a fast task to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me, prior to using the beauty blender, I assumed it was most likely an overly-hyped and expensive glorified makeup sponge. I still had to try it though and immediately upon using it, I loved it and haven&#x27;t stopped using it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have it, you will soon wonder how you got along with out it! Highly recommend and a must-have whether you are a make-up newbie or guru! :)</li>
            <li> The sponge continued to bleed red dye after several uses and the cleaner did not remove the stain of the make-up.  I didn&#x27;t feel the cleaner cleansed.</li>
            <li> My gf uses this and say it works great for her makeup application. The sponge is soft and the cleaner works well. She uses the sponge damp.</li>
            <li> Beauty blender is the best tool to use to apply makeup. It&#x27;s soft, blends makeup very evenly &amp; leaves an airbrush finish.</li>
            <li> I wont say much because this product speaks for itself. This is one amazing blender sponge so professional makeup artists give his a 10 star rate. Want a flawless looking face? get this sponge.. not even.. 2 sponges AND a cleanser.. awesome!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the beauty blenders! They apply foundation flawlessly! And very easy to clean! I will defiantly recommend them to all my friends! In fact! I already have!</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on very smooth and it cleans up very well.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about bacteria in the sponge because you clean it with every use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for ways to improve the application of my liquid foundation, so far my fingers have been my favorite form of application. I hated the streaks and lines left by foundation brushes and tried stippling brushes but didn&#x27;t lake the cakey finish it left me with.     This provides a nice finish to my liquid foundation, but not a huge difference from just using my fingers. It&#x27;s simply not worth the cost. I believe when it comes to makeup, the formula makes more of a difference on your face then the tool you apply it with. I use the Revlon ColorStay and it provides a matte finish and plenty of coverage. So this sponge didn&#x27;t really make a difference.     I am fine with my finger application but I have an upcoming wedding, so I figured I&#x27;d give this sponge a try to see if it could give me a more flawless result.     I did have a concern when I saw pink coming out of the sponge as I cleaned it, makes me wonder if some of the pink coloring is also coming off on my skin? I mean vivid bright pink water shouldn&#x27;t be coming out as I rinse it, unless that&#x27;s the color makeup I applied.    I do clean it with the cleanser, it&#x27;s nice and easy to use nothing special. It has a lavender smell to it.     Overall, it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d rave about. Yes it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but you have to take more time with it, dampening it before use, applying makeup, then cleansing it and putting it to dry for the next use. To me that&#x27;s just too much work. I like to get my foundation, dab it on my face, spread with my fingers, wash my hands and go.   Before purchasing this, if you haven&#x27;t tried applying liquid foundation with your fingers, I&#x27;d say do it! You got the precision to cover all the crevices of your face, and doesn&#x27;t leave brush lines or streaks.   If you don&#x27;t like the finish you get with your fingers, then give this a try. But it is kind of a hassle and in my opinion, overpriced. Also, Target offers a similar product in blue, at half the price, you could also check that out too.</li>
            <li> This item is wonderful.  I tried to buy a generic sponge and its NOTHING compared to the real product.  Price is kinda high, but definately worth it.  Cleanser works great on sponge too.  Would totally buy again.</li>
            <li> Best sponge on the market.  good deal.  I usually order from Sephora, but this was a better deal.</li>
            <li> First off this is a great price for what you get, much cheaper than Sephora where I usually purchase my beauty blenders. The bb sponges worked great for about 2-3 weeks then they both started to form a hard spot on the bottom. After about 1-2 more weeks of use they both split in same place where hard spot formed. I&#x27;ve never had this happen, I&#x27;m not sure if they we&#x27;re fake or just a defect.  I was so disappointed 😕, I do not plan to purchase anymore from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I really really like these! When I first got them I thought they both felt very cheap and tried to google if this Amazon store sold me cheap knock-offs. They were small and flimsy. But after wetting one and using it for the first time, WOW!! It worked wonderfully and made my concealer/foundation look very natural. The cleanser gets all the makeup out completely every time. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 2 months now and the first sponge is still in perfect condition. Love it!</li>
            <li> love my beauty blenders</li>
            <li> Awesome Price for 2 beauty blenders and a cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried the blenders twice so far, and both times I&#x27;ve loved the results. My BB and CC creams go on great; even better results than my real techniques brush. The difference is &amp;#34;stamping&amp;#34; your foundation/creams with the blender, vs &amp;#34;swirling&amp;#34; with a brush. I tried to use the blender with a setting powder, but prefer to use a brush for setting powders from now on and use the blenders just for cream products. If you&#x27;ve never used a beauty blender before, you should wet it and then towel dry before applying product. The blender will grow in size and be a little damp, but works best this way. You should wash your blenders regularly. I wash mine after each application, but I have friends who wash it every 2 applications. The first few times you wash the blender pink dye runs out in the water, but no pink dye is ever transferred from the blender to your makeup/skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the liquid cleanser or the dispenser. To use the dispenser you&#x27;re supposed to push the blender onto the top, but the liquid doesn&#x27;t really get absorbed and ends up squirting down the side of the bottle. I also had to use a lot of product and it didn&#x27;t get all the cream off. I ended up washing the blender 3 times, then used my regular brush cleanser to get everything completely off. Make sure to let the blender air dry completely (the package has a clear plastic stand to use), or else the blender can and will grow mold (friend&#x27;s experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I loved the blenders, but wasn&#x27;t impressed with the cleanser. However, you can&#x27;t beat this price! Amazon&#x27;s price for this package at the time I purchased it was $30.99, and Sephora&#x27;s price is 39.95!</li>
            <li> Just the best of the best I really love this one makes my makeup look really nice I love it</li>
            <li> This sponge is spectacular - I am amazed by it.  The double pack and cleanser was priced just right.  It arrived promptly and I am nothing but pleased with it!  Every foundation-wearer should own one of these!</li>
            <li> Makes my makeup look flawless.  I&#x27;m addicted.  Won&#x27;t be without them now.</li>
            <li> This little sponge just does wonders. The face looks flawless ever since i bought it i stopped using my brushes. Amazing!!. Girls who still don&#x27;t own it they have to.</li>
            <li> Everyone NEEDS a beauty blender. These little sponges are a miracle for makeup application!</li>
            <li> wors great makeup goes on flawless and even will definatly buy another one in the future bought one for my mom also</li>
            <li> I love the beauty blender.  Best way to put on foundation and even powder</li>
            <li> Omg love love love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> The beauty blender is the best on the market and the price for two with the cleaner was awesome. I use the cleaner for my other brushes as well so it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i didn&#x27;t want to keep touching my face to put on makeup. it goes on so smooth and looks natural. i love the even coverage.</li>
            <li> Great sponge! Sponge blends the foundation in evenly. Love the smell of the sponge cleanser. Great deal on this product!</li>
            <li> The only thing I use, besides my fingers to apply my foundation. It gives the most flawless, airbrushed finish. They last a while as long as you take care and clean it after every use.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Best deal out there and no I didn&#x27;t not get a fake. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal! I have never bought the sponges by themselves because they are too expensive. But with is deal you get two practically for the price of one plus the cleanser! Highly recommend the sponges work incredibly well. Best way to put on foundation.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about all the rave reviews our there about this product, but I am happy to say that this item actually lives up to the hype! These sponges make it very easy to get even coverage using a minimal amount of product in a fraction of the time it took me to apply foundation in the past. As long as you take a brief moment to learn the proper technique for using the sponge, it&#x27;s pretty fool-proof. $30 (or more) is a big investment for a set of makeup sponges, but the results are truly worth it!</li>
            <li> This beauty blender changed my entire view on makeup.  I am super fair skinned and Its a constant battle of finding the proper shade and application technique in order to make my face look good, not cakey. For this reason I kind of gave up getting that flawless look and just figured it wasnt in the cards for me.. Well boy was I wrong! I am so glad I found this blender.  When you use it right, your skin looks amazing and airbrushed - you can not even tell you have it on.  To apply my foundation I have used brushes,  sponges, my fingers ... NOTHING compares to this. Get one, I promise you wont regret it ! Just make sure you use it correctly :)</li>
            <li> It really blends in the makeup perfectly! Also it&#x27;s piece of mind knowing your applicator is bacterial free there fore there is minimal break outs whic is key!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these.  They were just what she wanted. Quality is as expected, very high. Just what a young woman wants fior beauty.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge. Blends contour beautifully, giving a natural finish! Plus this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> great value for 2 beauty blenders.  its like getting the cleaner for free.  I apply my liquid foundations exclusively with beauty blenders as the provide a nice buildable application that is easy to control and does not leave seams or brush stroke lines that many brushes do. will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps they give u the option to subscribe that u can choose frequency of delivery and get additional savings. if you like it and you have a good idea when u typically need to replace you can sign up to have it shipped to you as a subscription for even cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love the way I can apply makeup</li>
            <li> Great item &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> love the sponges love the cleaner, hate the price, really makes your makeup look pretty though. my foundation looks way more natural</li>
            <li> One thing, the sponge releases a pink tint-coloring every time you wash it. Decreases with use but if you gave skin allergies, it may be a consideration. However, the color does not go on your face when blending or at least I didn&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the soap  or cleanser for the sponge. It&#x27;s a pump so it&#x27;s convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, as described!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on many factors. The product works extremely well for make-up application however, I have used it for less than a week and it is already cracking. I have only used the cleanser purchased with the applicator so I find this unacceptable. I value Amazon&#x27;s reviews highly and also sent this as a gift to my aunt and mother. This is my first disappointment as a longtime Prime customer.</li>
            <li> My cleanser won&#x27;t dispense properly, so I have to open the jar and pour a tiny bit on the sponge.  This is enough to drag the review down a bit...however, the sponge is so awesome, it keeps the review at 5 stars!    For a few years now I&#x27;ve been trying to find a foundation that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;ve caked stuff on (which basically rules out all compact-style foundations) and that matches my very pale skin tone (which rules out a lot of others).  Chantecaille&#x27;s cream-style Future Skin was excellent in texture but too dark for me, for example.    I finally found a great color from Haba USA, but the foundation is a very runny liquid.  For a week I struggled to get a good application but it always came out streaky and looked bad.  I was about to give up and go back on the hunt for some other brand, when I decided to order this Beautyblender combo.  (I&#x27;d been eying it for months, but not sure it was worth the price.)    This thing is a miracle.  It is a very soft foam and it&#x27;s actually like a bulb with a narrow rounded tip (in the pictures it appears to be a flat sponge with a teardrop shape).  Reminds me of the foam used for the super-decibel-cutting earplugs they make.  Closed-cell foam?      Because the foam is so dense, it doesn&#x27;t soak up tons of foundation like some sponges do, and it applies it very evenly.  Over a few days of experimenting I found that swiping it on produces a more even result than blotting it on.  This is a PERFECT product and have already bought one as a gift for my sister.  As long as Beautyblender&#x27;s in business, I&#x27;ll be supporting them.</li>
            <li> I love this product its the best beauty tool I have, it honestly replace majority of my brushes.</li>
            <li> I am loving this beyond words! I use a liquid foundation and have very fair skin, so lines are a bit easy to see if I leave them on my face. This sponge is a wonder tool, no lines, supper soft, and easy to use. It cuts down on time in the morning for me and helps me avoid the 4 different brushes I normally use. This is an all-in-one tool that is great for a air brushed finish! &#x3D;D couldn&#x27;t be happier it was worth the splurge!</li>
            <li> The beauty blender was all i heard it would be.  it allows your makeup to go on smoothly and without lines.  I just recently purchased the pure sponge as well.  And the cleanser is fabulous. Cleans brushes as well. Keeps all your cleaning tools on point!</li>
            <li> The soap spilled all over my package.</li>
            <li> wrks great, makes my make up application super simple. If you wear liquid foundation, this product is a must in your make up bag.</li>
            <li> Works well but it cracks and chunks even come out of it,</li>
            <li> This is the greatest blending sponge out there and you can wash and reuse it. I&#x27;ve washed it plenty of times and it has not fallen apart compared to others sponges or the triangle ones. This is far by the best beauty sponge out there wet or dry works wonderful!</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOVE the fact that not only do you get 2 sponges but you also get the cleanser to go along with it and for half of what it would cost at your local store!  Would buy again!  Dont hesitate!  It&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Clean after EACH use and allow to air dry or your sponge will become moldy and cause breakouts!  This is a staple product and I do not leave home without it!</li>
            <li> The Beautyblender sponge was a great find. I&#x27;ve tried it all. Brushes, fingers,&lt;br /&gt;sponge wedges and the Beautyblender by far is the best! A friend recommended that&lt;br /&gt;I try it and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I haven&#x27;t tried the cleanser yet but my friend&lt;br /&gt;says it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the makeup from the Beautyblender.</li>
            <li> Using the beauty blender is the best was to get a flawless look with foundation. This kit is a lot cheaper than buying them separately so what a bargain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a youtube makeup tutorial addict so before i get anything new i go on to youtube and check out the reviews. Everyone and I mean everyone had nothing but good things to say about the Beautyblender so I got it and let me tell you its a must have, it blends foundations flawlessly and it doesn&#x27;t matter what brand of foundation you use it ALWAYS blends it out wonderfully. when you wash it it all kinds of pink washes out with it so that was kind of strange, I havent tried the cleanser yet, baby shampoo is my brush cleanser preference. I even use the blender to blend out cream highlights</li>
            <li> The Best thing i have ever had in my life ,every one have to try it . I love it</li>
            <li> Better than I expected. My makeup goes on flawlessly with the beauty blender</li>
            <li> LOVE my new BB &amp;#60;3 I should have switched a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Great price for product.  This is the authentic beauty blender.  When I first looked at it, I thought it was not because the sponges looked so small.  When I soaked it (as you&#x27;re supposed to do before use), it &amp;#34;swelled&amp;#34; to the size of my original well used sponge.</li>
            <li> This is too expensive and not really worth it. Sorry, I had wanted to love this product- but there are plenty of cheaper alternatives at CVS and you really don&#x27;t need a cleanser- 2 dollar baby shampoo works just as well.</li>
            <li> These are the best makeup sponges I have ever used.  My foundation looks flawless. I don&#x27;t want to ever be without these.  The cleanser is also good and is convenient the way it is packaged.  I purchased these even though I thought they were expensive for makeup sponges, but they are worth it.  I&#x27;m glad I splurged on them.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are very, very expensive but this sponge did allow me to accomplish the best application of foundation ever. Very, very natural finish. I like the cleanser very much also although I&#x27;m sure I could get the same results from using an antibacterial hand soap to cleanse the sponge. I was initially worried that the lavendar in the cleanser would bother my sinuses but there is only a very, very light scent so I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I&#x27;m waiting to see how long the sponges hold up -- the package reads 3 months. If I get three months out of a sponge I will probably re-order. I doubt that I&#x27;ll re-order the cleanser though.</li>
            <li> I like the sponges, they do work really well in foundation application. But I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the cheaper imitations. I don&#x27;t like the cleanser. I had to do multiple rounds of soaping and lathering before I could get the sponge to a point where I&#x27;d be comfortable using it again the next day...even then some foundation color remained. For the price, it&#x27;s not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> BEST INVENTION EVER!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. The best for cover foundation.</li>
            <li> this product is as great as everyone says it is!!! i plan on purchasing another beauty blender sponge soon, (dog got ahold of it :( )</li>
            <li> I was doubting this when I bought it, but wow it works great! I use it for foundation and highlighter/corrector. Then use a brush to set it. These blend great!</li>
            <li> The beauty blender sponge is life changing for anyone who wants to contour and highlightlike a pro!</li>
            <li> the best blender sponge</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my beauty blender makes make up application amazing!</li>
            <li> The cleaner kit is the best for these sponges! The makeup comes out quickly and it smells great. I&#x27;d absolutely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> best foundation applicators, cheapest I have found for this incredible brand. use it every day!! durable as can be, someone I know has had their beauty blenders for over 4 years and is a make up artist. QUALITY PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> im thinking of ordering another pair because my son chew on my blenders but they work great and 100% like in the picture</li>
            <li> I have used a Foundation Brush for years and thought nothing could beat the the look of my makeup, until a friend of mine came to visit that I had not seen in a couple of months and her face looked FANTASTIC--I asked if she had new makeup, what she was doing and she siad it was this Beautyblender Sponge--i did not belive her so I had to try it myself.  Absolutly the best product for your foundation application--your make-up looks flawless.  I will never go back to a brush.</li>
            <li> Love that is comes with 2 beauty blenders and a soap always have loved beauty blenders and this is a very good deal and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Flawless finish and so versatile; easy to use.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i was looking for. i love it, flawless finish. It was easy to clean with the cleanser, but dont use too much. I was a lil heavy on the soap but it cleaned it.</li>
            <li> LOVE the sponges. Not crazy about the wash, it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup from the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift for my daughter and she can&#x27;t say enough great things about how smoothly and evenly it applies makeup. She loves the feel of it too. She has used others but only recommends this one - to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love using this applicator to apply my make up. Creates a smooth finish and is easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> This is great for starters</li>
            <li> Best make up applicator, it really doesn&#x27;t compare with others in the market. It&#x27;s worth the money and helps blend make up beautifully.</li>
            <li> My new best friend and now part of my daily makeup ritual. I absolutely love this product and may never go back to using a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I have been buying the beauty blender for a few years now. I love it and would not want to do my makeup without it! Amazon has it for the best price, too!</li>
            <li> This beautyblender kit made a perfect gift. It is a great deal for the price considering how great both the sponges and the cleanser are. I would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I defiantly see a difference in my makeup application vs. using regular sponges but I really dislike the price of these sponges I did see a generic brand in the store for about $2 will  be trying those next..</li>
            <li> It has been applying my make up okay. I do not see much of a difference between this and Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge (it&#x27;s only $6!!!) But so far it has been doing the same thing for me. One thing I DO NOT LIKE about this product is that when I wash it, the pink color washes off too. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to do that.. I&#x27;m used to just foundation-color washing off my sponges so the pink color was a surprise for me.</li>
            <li> Wow! Who knew this little blender could make SUCH a difference. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of high quality foundation brushes (spending a LOT of money) - and they are ALL inferior compared to this product. I love it! I will never go without one again.</li>
            <li> I really like the beauty blender. Just too expensive wait and get w points.</li>
            <li> I love the flawless application this product provides. My large pores and acne are concealed after applying any liquid foundation with the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Love them.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The hype is for real. Blends in foundation, powder, and even concealer in seconds. Don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have purchased it over and over again. The best part is it lasts for months!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet to apply makeup however as soon as I opened it I could tell an immediate difference between the one I bought at Sephora and this one here. This one seems smaller in the shape is a little off. I&#x27;m starting to believe this is a knock off. Also once I dampened the sponge it felt different, and a lot tougher than my original beauty blunders. I&#x27;ve had numerous ones over the years. So far I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the Beautyblender, it really blends the make up very well, leaves your face so smooth! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love my beautyblender, I love how it makes my foundation look flawless. I was very pleased with my purchase, love the scent of the soap and it cleans it very good taking all the excess makeup out!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and tons of recommendations I decided to try this product to apply my foundation bu I really don;t like it.  I find that I am still choosing to apply my foundation with my fingers because I like the coverage and look of that application better than using the beauty blender.  I find the beauty blender leaves my foundation spotty looking and wastes to much of the foundation. Maybe I am just using it wrong (I will look up some more videos and than update review if any changes occur).</li>
            <li> So as a makeup artist, I can get discounts on these at pro stores. Down side... those stores are so damn far for me! I really wanted to test it out so lets save me some gas $$ and just order on Amazon. The amount I would save regardless is still less than what gas is these days. Gas in California... IS RIDICULOUS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the item is amazing. The cleaner is GREAT even for reg. brushes that need a good deep cleaning. Down side, w/ the pump the cleaner spills over everywhere so it&#x27;s not as EASY as it&#x27;s made out to be. Otherwise, the beauty blender is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I expected them to be bigger but I still like it , it was a good buy considered the price of how much they usually are .</li>
            <li> Good quality product! And it came fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny I paid..it make my foundation look soo professional and natural on face like the celebrities on red carpet</li>
            <li> This is the best thing any girl can have in her makeup collection. It blends the foundation so well, it works like magic.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Up until a few months ago I never knew what a beauty blender was.i used to use my fingers to blend my foundation.  I saw on you tube girls using this product for makeup tutorials and so I found it cheaper on amazon two for the price of one! Plus it comes with the cleaner.  Now I&#x27;m addicted to this product!! I use it everyday! I swear by the beauty blender every girl should have one! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My makeup routine has been COMPLETELY transformed by this tool. It took me a long time to buy into the hype,  but it&#x27;s truly did make a difference!</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! I&#x27;m so happy I bought this sponge. I use it almost everyday! It works wonderfully when I&#x27;m applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> The product is fake and I believe the reviews are also. Do not purchase!</li>
            <li> As described, Came on time...would order again.</li>
            <li> if you ever owned this product, you know it works great! product was real and as described.</li>
            <li> no other sponges compare. I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li> FAKE. Counterfeit product. I want my money back ASAP.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Beauty Blender just like these about a year ago. They&#x27;ve lasted me until about 2 months ago. So, I made another purchase, and these are ALREADY getting like holes in them.</li>
            <li> Great bundle deal and blends effortlessly to perfection. Tried some sponges in the past but nothing beats this. When I initially washed it the first time, some color rinsed out, however, that didn&#x27;t affect its job nor did the color fade, so I wasn&#x27;t bothered with that. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The ones I got were fake. I have one I brought from sephora and the amazon one does not  dry and drink back to a small size like the sephora one. Also the sponge cleaner smells terrible! Had to re clean all my brushes to get that smell out. My amazon blender even start to peel and tear. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase my beauty blender from here again. Next time I&#x27;ll go to sephora where I know it&#x27;s legit. Not everything you buy on the internet is authentic and I&#x27;m upset because that was $25 spent! Not a happy customer :(</li>
            <li> I wish I could have returned it. It could be user error but it is a lot of effort to use it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of getting this from anywhere other than beauty blenders website or Sephora just because of all the knock offs. But I compared this to the beauty blender I bought from Sephora and they are the exact same. So this is the real deal. Love the Beauty blender, helps blend in makeup so much better than a brush and with this cleanser, it is super easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to wait until the sponge is dry to clean it. It is harder to clean it when the sponge is wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price for two sponges and the cleanser!</li>
            <li> I purchased these at Walgreens but this sponge is everything everyone has been saying it is! The  Beauty Blender really blends out your foundation quick and seamlessly. It doesn&#x27;t soak up all your foundation like other makeup sponges. It&#x27;s just great!&lt;br /&gt;I know they say you should change it every 3 months..but it is kind of pricey and I try to extend  the use past 3 months. The first one I&#x27;ve used up to 6 months and it was still working great but I just knew I had to change it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was trying to clean out the very tip.  But other than that, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what I&#x27;m most impressed with is the THE CLEANSER!!! I&#x27;ve only ever cleaned my makeup brushes with whatever shampoo and soap I had laying around, even the tried and true baby shampoo, but this cleanser has changed my world and has made life so much easier.. I clean my brushes every two weeks instead of waiting 2+ months (i know its gross)! Normally the way we would clean our make up brushes is to swirl them into the palm of our hand with soap and water, right? ..and that takes suuuuper long especially if you have a handful of brushes, and sometimes we might have to dip them in soap twice or more. Not anymore.  I just add a couple squirts of the cleanser into a small bucket of warm water, swish all the brushes around and leave them in there to soak for 30-45 minutes.  I swish them around again and just rinse them off by swishing them in the bucket with clean water once or twice and it&#x27;s all clean! I used to clean them again with hand soap after soaking just to make sure it was really clean, but after finding that no makeup residue was showing up anymore after a few brushes, I just rinsed them off.  I do clean the bigger brushes in the palm of my hands before rinsing since they are more dense but that&#x27;s it. And then I sanitize them in rubbing alcohol and water.  Love the cleanser!!!!</li>
            <li> Already using the blender, I needed a new one and the price was great for a double set plus the cleaner.</li>
            <li> I Love this product!!!!! It Makes my foundation look airbrushed I never have lines and great for highlighting and contouring.</li>
            <li> Everything came great and i love the product! I already started using one of the blenders and im impressed! I&#x27;m very happy that i invested in this product!</li>
            <li> These BB&#x27;s are the bomb!!  The cleaner that comes with them is wonderful!  I&#x27;m so happy I decided to spend the money and get this set!  I do a lot of airbrush makeup and these give the same finish.  Just make sure they are damp before blending and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the products. I have been using the beauty blender for years now and still love it. This was my first time purchasing the cleaner and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I already owned a beauty blender in which it was getting old and need cleaned and I tried cleaning it on my own shampoo and it just did not do the job. So I ordered this and I am so glad I did. The cleanser is amazing and of course I love the beauty blenders. I recommend this to all my beauty blender freaks. Or anyone that wants a dewy perfect foundation or powder!</li>
            <li> I bought my beauty blenders back in March and have really loved them! They haven&#x27;t shown any sign up wear or tear, and they&#x27;ve barely faded. I don&#x27;t use them everyday, but I do wash them every use. The cleaner that comes with them works amazingly and doesn&#x27;t take much at all to cleanse them. They blend foundation nearly perfectly, much better than my foundation brush was doing. I even use the large end to apply blush, and then squeeze it to make it smaller for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product I still love using. The price may be a little steep, but it&#x27;s a very well-made product that won&#x27;t just fall apart. Already planning to re-purchase after mine are done.</li>
            <li> It is the best way for blend the mackup</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I watched a makeup tutorial on YouTube, about applying liquid foundation with the Beautyblender and I thought I would like it.  Makeup goes on very evenly and natural looking. The pointed end is great for around the nose and corner of the eyes. It&#x27;s very easy to use.  The liquid cleanser is used to wash the sponge and does a great job.  I would recommend this product.  Better than applying makeup with a brush or your fingertips.</li>
            <li> Got this for my gf and probably my best purchase for her. She is always using it only thing I guess is the soap pump is probably only good enough for 1 of the eggs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Beautyblender sponge and cleanser for several years.  The sponge is very good for putting on liquid makeup and not streaking.  Works better than drug-store cosmetic sponges.  The cleanser is very good to clean sponge from time to time.  Gets all the makeup out which just soap and water does not.</li>
            <li> Though I think they&#x27;re over-priced, these are THE best foundation applicators!!</li>
            <li> The sponges are fabulous ! They leave a flawless finish with little effort , even when I&#x27;m in a hurry ! The cleanser is awesome as well it leaves the sponges squeaky clean and my make up brushes too ! I highly recommend this product !</li>
            <li> This sponge is everything you&#x27;ve heard it is!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these beauty blenders, I kept one for personal use and use the for clients. It apply&#x27;s concealer flawleesly when damp, I have yet to use this for foundation. The beauty blender soap is great, it doesnt leave or have a strong scent and cleans my beauty blenders without leaving any residue of foundation. Totally worth the buy will definitely be ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> Classic sponge. The cleaner is amazing as well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> sponges were too small</li>
            <li> I love my beauty blender! Now that I have it I don&#x27;t know how I ever applied makeup without it! It gives me a flawless coverage and an airbrushed look! It also feels so fresh when applying make up! All in all my favorite beauty product........ So far. Super easy to clean and affordable. Thanks amazon:)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these sponges.  Blends make up really well and easy to keep clean.  Work better than any other sponge I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this item out since I heard great things about it. Unfortunately this sponge caused me to break out. I have acne prone skin and I tried out the beauty blender with the same Bobbi Brown foundation that I&#x27;ve been using forever and it caused me to breakout everywhere. I did wash the item with the soap that came with the kit, watched youtube videos on how to care for the item and followed the instructions. I tried it out a few times and after several trials, concluded that it was the beauty blender sponge that was causing my breakouts. Even after washing it with soap so many times, I&#x27;m still concerned that everytime I squeeze it the water runs pink... I assume that whatever dye is used to make these sponges pink is probably also going into my pores and causing my breakouts :(</li>
            <li> Like many people who wanted to save money, I opted for the knock off first, none ever did as good a job as the original!! The beauty blender has no parallel!! Love this blender and the soap is great also!</li>
            <li> OMG I AM IN LOVE!!!!!!!!!! Great price for two of them plus the cleaner! I believe that one of them is a dud though. The are not the same color and they even feel different. I think one is the real thing and the other is not but they both are great sponges! The one that I feel to be &amp;#34;the real beauty blender&amp;#34; feels better and cleans easier than the other. The &amp;#34;dud&amp;#34; is more difficult to clean and doesn&#x27;t feel as great as the true beauty blender. I love the way my makeup looks when using this blender! I have gotten so many compliments and my makeup looks &amp;#34;flawless!&amp;#34; For the most part, I use them wet and the results are great. The cleanser that comes with it is great as well!! WIN WIN for sure!!</li>
            <li> Love the beauty blender</li>
            <li> These are not the original beauty blenders, they are a slightly different shape and texture. They soak up way too much product. Buyer beware do not buy from this seller</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the beauty blender! I was introduced to it at sephora and hated myself for paying 20+ dollars for a make up &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; but after the first use I was addicted!  I will not pay the price they want at sephora so I came to Amazon to purchase the set with the cleaner for 2 times less then sephora wanted. It shipped quick and was the real deal! Definitely not knock off. The sponge makes applying foundation so much nicer than a brush and practically makes your skin look flawless. Forever a beauty blender user!</li>
            <li> I am a freelance mua and this is not only a staple in my home but also in my kit. The BB is perfect for applying foundation to give you an amazingly flawless airbrushed finish. I also use it to blend out concealer and powder highlight.  I couldn&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the beauty blender. The only thing I wish I did differently was buy the solid soap instead of the liquid. Though, I did read somewhere that hotel or dollar store soap works just as well, if not better, than the soap that is sold with the sponges. 10/10 would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these. My makeup goes on great, no streaks and looks great. I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I use these sponges every day--they really do live up to the hype and price. They are amazing for not only blending, but also contouring due to the pointy and blunt sides. I tried applying foundation with them, but they are super absorbent and therefore not ideal for that purpose. I have tried cleaning them with gentle soap, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as effective as the cleanser that comes with them.  I&#x27;ve had them for quite some time and they have held up nicely.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you use this makeup sponge. I was a little leery at first spending so much on a &#x27;sponge&#x27; but this is so SO much better than a sponge! It feels and looks like you airbrushed your makeup on when using this! I can&#x27;t believe I used to apply my makeup with a brush before. This has the best coverage, without giving you that caked on look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser that comes with this sponge is a different story. It will clean your sponge.. but it doesn&#x27;t take away all of the makeup &#x27;stain&#x27; that is left over like it claims to. I have tried soaking it in a bowl with some of the cleanser in it, like is suggested, and it didn&#x27;t help at all. The only part of the sponge that seems to stain is the bottom.. the pointed tip area of the sponge always comes clean. I&#x27;m going to be trying the other soap like cleanser for these sponges instead.</li>
            <li> It applies great for applying foundation, concealer, and blush. Made everything go on flawless. The ball started to tear after three uses.</li>
            <li> Love these! Make sure you don&#x27;t store them with the lid on in the container.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on beautifully and looks great.  Easy to use and the cleanser is good,though not sure it is necessary to purchase. You can clean the sponge with something else.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite way to apply liquid foundation. It makes it so beautiful and seamless. You don&#x27;t have to worry about brush strokes or an uneven finish. It makes your skin looked airbrushed and perfect. It&#x27;s great for apply under eye concealer as well. This is a great buy on Amazon. It&#x27;s normally a lot more for two sponges at Sephora and it doesn&#x27;t include the cleanser. The cleanser is really nice but I do not like the package. I normally love that type of bottle but it&#x27;s really difficult to get the product onto the sponge. I normally have to push the pump down with my fingers and then flip the bottle over so the gel can slide onto my hands. Other than that this is a definite buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about Beautyblender for quite some time.  Not sure why it took me so long to try these out.  Since I&#x27;m always on the look out for new ways to apply my foundation. But I&#x27;m glad I finally got my hands on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I prefer using these is to first apply foundation all around my face with regular foundation brush without bothering to blend it out. Then I use the Beautyblender to actually blend things out nicely.  And I gotta say these do the job perfectly well. I even use the pointier end of the blender under my eyes after I just applied concealer with my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I took out one star is for budgetary reasons. First reason is the obvious high cost of the blenders.  Make up sponges are available for fraction of the cost in the pharmacy, and I&#x27;m not saying they would do as good of a job, but for someone on tight budget that could be a much better option.  Another reason is the fact that these blenders just like any other sponges absorb a lot of product. So if you decide to use these, expect the small bottles of foundation to last less amount of time than normally, and hence more burden on your pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great foundation/concealer/blender tool, as long as not on a very tight budget.</li>
            <li> Had some issues with these blenders but Amazon took care of it. Prefer the solid cleaner to this liquid though</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cosmetic purchases I have ever made, it blends beautifully, and I use it EVERY day. The cleanser is also fantastic, it cleans the sponge and its great on all my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I like the sponges but I don&#x27;t think is something amazing, kinda expensive, but the cleanser is the best I ever used, I used to spend an hour washing my brushes with the mac cleanser and they never left totally clean though but with this one is so fast, very easy and I love the light smell that it has!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing liquid foundation for twenty years. I have tried every newfangled way of applying it: from expensive foundation brushes, all types of sponges and of course, my fingers. I always go back to application by finger. Seems the easiest and most effective way. Then I saw Beauty Blender in a YouTube video. It intrigued me. I watched a few You tube tutorials, and decided I should buy one. At twenty bucks for one sponge, it is pricey, but I went for it, but keeping my expectation level down. I&#x27;ve tried too many gimmicks... but this is no gimmick. It REALLY WORKS! It transforms your foundation to an airbrushed look. So easy to apply (just make sure sponge is damp), and apply in a bouncing/stippling motion. You need very little foundation with this method... so what you pay for the BeautyBlender you may actually save on buying less foundation.     I use Liquid Foundation (Clinique Repairwear - $29 a bottle). But I think you can use the BeautyBlender with cream or mineral foundation. I also use the pointed end of the Beauty Blender to stipple on my eye concealer -- I use either Bobbi Brown or Amazing Cosmetics (both are dense creams). Does a good job of applying the concealer.      Now about  the BB cleanser:    1) The Pink Dye does run when I use the Beauty Blender Cleanser. Don&#x27;t has this issue if I use mild hand soap or Clinique \\&quot;Take the Day Off\\&quot; Makeup remover. Hmmm????   2) I don&#x27;t  like the method of dispensing the cleanser. The five ounce version has a pump dispensing method which means you have to place the BeautyBlender on the pump to release the cleanser liquid. The foundation transfers from the BB to the pump, so you have to clean that up. Yuck! The 3 ounce bottle is a  squeeze/pour dispenser.     Overall, hands down, one of my best beauty purchases EVER!    Suggest you go on YouTube and and view some BeautyBlender tutorials. It will help you perfect the application.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE skeptic when it comes to beauty tools.  I&#x27;ve used everything--sponges, fingers, expensive brushes.  No matter what I used my make up never quite looked right&#x27; it was always a bit streaky and wore off by midday.  I was super hesitant to spend this amount of money on a sponge, but I needed new brushes anyway and after watching youtube reviews, I decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge really blew me away.  I used a lot less foundation and it went on smoothly.  No streaks, and it seemed to last all day!  Not sure what I&#x27;ve been doing wrong for the past 18 years, but this was certainly an amazing find.  I still have a powder brush, blush brush and eye brushes, but for the basics, I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to any other method again.</li>
            <li> These are the best applicator for applying makeup.  They don&#x27;t absorb all your makeup like sponges and cleanup is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The Beauty Blender is like no other make-up sponge you will ever use.  The price may seem steep, but when you think about the fact that it&#x27;s washable &amp; reusable, it&#x27;s not so bad.  And it blends make-up so perfectly!  Say goodby to those ugly, dark under-eye circles because with the Beauty Blender &amp; your favorite concealer, you won&#x27;t see them any more!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, this was recommended in a beauty book I read and after reading all the reviews I hesitantly bought this, (the price just seems steep for a little sponge (or two) , but..... its AWESOME! Used correctly ( I viewed a couple youtube tutorials and read a lot of reviews on here) it makes your makeup flawless! I gave my college age daughter my extra one and she loves it too.I wont be without one of these again! (and the cleanser does smell really nice )</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after having a friend recommend it.  It does a beautiful job covering acne scars and large pores.  I used it for both mineral and liquid foundation, and both times the coverage was excellent.  It really cleaned up all the \\&quot;life\\&quot; problems on my face and I look forward to using it a lot.  The cleanser works great, as well.  I cleaned all my makeup brushes with it and the product worked to get rid of all the residue and build up.  It also has a nice clean scent.  Great products, both of them.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of a Beautyblender, it&#x27;s really great for getting the right coverage with oily foundations, especially drugstore foundations. I found that it does give more natural coverage than using brushes. But it is not as travel friendly as a makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However with drier foundations (for summertime, I usually use oil-free), it can be harder to get the foundation off of the Beautyblender and onto your face. Most of it will get soaked up by the Beautyblender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser works well, however you want to make sure that you don&#x27;t use too much and dry out your Beautyblender, so think of it more as spot cleaning than trying to soak the entire thing in soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The sponge applicator is so easy to use and clean. I have not used other sponge applicators before so I cannot compare with others. But I love this product so far.</li>
            <li> I love this little sponge!  It makes applying foundation a breeze, better than any other way I&#x27;ve tried.  Foundation melts into skin, and it never goes on cakey.  Makes blending a breeze, no more noticeable line around my face if my shade isn&#x27;t exactly right.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product was exactly how it was described!!! I Love AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best beauty tool that I have purchased in the last ten years. Cannot even begin to describe how much better my makeup application is. Will purchase again and again</li>
            <li> I cannot do my makeup with out my beauty blender. It makes for such an even, flawless appearance. I used mine dry, for a more full coverage, and use the tapered side to blend out concealer. The cleanser is my absolute favorite. You get a pretty generous sized bottle, the only downside being the dispensing tip, as it tends to waste a bit of product and I don&#x27;t like getting the tip dirty. Aside from that, I love how well the cleanser works. It dissolves and cleans all the makeup built up not only on my beauty blenders, but on all my other brushes as well and I love the soft, lavender scent it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I bought the original Beauty Blenders cheaper than here at Camera Ready Cosmetics website and I&#x27;m glad I was able to save a few bucks in this wasteful purchase. This product is highly over rated and I don&#x27;t understand all the fuss about them. They apply makeup just as good as the cheap, old style wedge puffs you find at your local drug store for just couple bucks for a full bag. These Beauty Blenders ripped after just 5 usages and they are definitely no worth the price! In addition, they consistently discharge pink ink every time you wet them, no matter how many times you wash they still discharge pink dye, which is totally gross. I&#x27;ll most definitely never buy them again and post a video on my YouTube recommending them not.</li>
            <li> Purchased on April 6, and it fell apart on me. Cleaned after every use with the beauty blender liquid cleanser. Very disappointed! Bought knockoffs that lasted longer :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what life was like before the beauty blender!!  Go on YouTube for tutorials for the best usage tips!</li>
            <li> LOVE my beauty blender!!! This is my second order-product Is excellent quality and delivery was quick!!</li>
            <li> I found the beauty blender to be average, not worth the hype. After a couple of months of using it, I found that it absorbs so much of my foundation, hence not giving me full coverage, and I would have to use more foundation. I switched back to my stippling brush which honestly, did a better job and used less foundation.</li>
            <li> Love the beauty blender sponge.  I bought some from sephora and they seem to be the same.  The cleaning solution smells greedy and works even with my brushes.  They do stain depending on the make up you use but it didn&#x27;t affect their performance.</li>
            <li> Once you go beauty blender, you won&#x27;t go back! These little sponges wear so well, give you a flawless and airbrushed finish for your makeup, and ultimately cause you to use less product as well! You can use them for foundation, BB cream, or tinted moisturizer, to blend out concealer, or whatever you need! They&#x27;re multitasking brush sponges! Worth it! Give them a try!</li>
            <li> This was a terrific bargain!! A Beauty blender usually costs $20 for just one. This one cost about $40 for two, but it also included a hefty sized bottle of Beauty blender cleanser. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This item is awesome helps to apply makeup so flawlessly..I bought two together still using on the first one and it&#x27;s had been many, many months since I started using the first one..long lasting</li>
            <li> I was unsure whether these BB would be legitimate, so I purchased a single BB from Sephora in order to assure the quality of them. The quality of this BB seems the same when dried and moist, so I assume they are actual BB! This product blends my foundation (Estee Lauder Double Wear) really well!</li>
            <li> Love the sponges, not so much on the liquid. Try the solid cleanser. It is amaze-balls and will change your life and extend the lives of your brushes and BB sponges. This is the only bottle of liquid cleanser I will buy. Soilds all the way from now on!</li>
            <li> Works just like it says. I admit I was expecting less. It blends my makeup perfectly. It&#x27;s easy to use too. I use it for everything: foundation, powder, highlight...even blush.</li>
            <li> If you prefer to apply your foundation with a sponge, you can&#x27;t do much better than this one. I&#x27;ve recently switched from latex sponges to the beautyblender and I&#x27;m happy I did. I get a much more airbrushed look without wasting too much product. To minimize the loss, I apply foundation to my face with a brush, then use the beautyblender to stipple it onto my skin. Unlike other reviewers, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dye coming out of the sponge, though the cleaner doesn&#x27;t 100% get the sponge clean. Clean enough though. It smells a little funny but that&#x27;s not the end of the world. What annoyed me is that mine didn&#x27;t come with the plastic stand to dry the sponge on. I had to save the insert of the plastic box and I&#x27;ve been using that as a \\&quot;pedestal\\&quot; of sorts. Otherwise, no real complaints.</li>
            <li> I love the combo price. I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;About the aplication finish, i hoped for a smoother finish. Maybe it depends on the foundation you&#x27;re using... i&#x27;ve used with beauty blender only the Maybelline SuperStay(tm) 24HR Makeup.. I&#x27;ll try a different foundation just because i&#x27;ve watched and read so many good reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing about the Beautyblender for quite some time and finally decided to purchase it. I love this product is blends out my foundation perfectly, a flawless finish. I will definitely be purchasing more for my clients.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and she loves it. She says it takes time to use it but her make up ends up looking flawless. So I recommend this to whoever loves an airbrush finish.</li>
            <li> Have been loving the beautyblender, it does seem to add a little bit of time to my makeup schedule but, it has been so worth it.  I have also noticed that I use a bit more foundation than when I use my brush but the coverage has been great and it gives a smooth even appearance.  I also like the packaging since there is a sperator in the container that allows me to keep the un-used sponge on the bottom and the one I am using on the top, it also has a little lid for the container.  Now, the container is cheap and thin plastic but, it gives me a place to store it to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is alot of cleanser, it doesnt take too much so I am sure this will last me through the life of the sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to friends and family and would re-purchase them.</li>
            <li> I love the beauty blender. It works wonders for your application. Let it dry completely before u wash it &amp; it will not stain. I wash it right before my next use since its used wet anyway. Makes your makeup application looks flawless. Great investment. I&#x27;m been using for 1 month with no problems.</li>
            <li> I purchased this beauty blender combo package after reading review on Amazon and Ulta as well as watching several YouTube reviews. The blender was easy to use and definitely should be used in it&#x27;s \\&quot;wet\\&quot; application form vs. dry. The stippling method was very easy for applying good foundation coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside that I found was that when I used the blender to apply BB Cream it was sucking up a *ton* of excess product. So where a blender application was taking 2-3 full pumps of Missha BB Cream, finger application was taking under 1 full pump and getting the same level of coverage. Since I&#x27;m using my BB Cream as a foundation there&#x27;s no other product in my routine to use the blender on and I&#x27;ve just sort of retired it to the back of the bathroom closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it might be great for liquid foundation application the blender is just the wrong tool for BB Creams; and BB Creams are turning out to be far better than foundation, making the blender an unnecessary tool.</li>
            <li> The best thing with this sponge is you can use the cheapest makeup and have it look flawless. If you don&#x27;t already have one, purchase, it won&#x27;t disappoint. And the cleaner will last you half a lifetime</li>
            <li> I love this! It is worth it and is actually cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great make up application. Cleaner works great as well. Works better when the sponge is wet. I am liking the beauty blender alot better then using my fingers.</li>
            <li> I love this combo. Great value! The cleanser didn&#x27;t have a pump lid, but no problem. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The sponges make for a smooth even application. Cleanser extends life of the product and removes germs. A great buy!</li>
            <li> Best blender I&#x27;ve ever bought. Follow the directions and you will be amazed!</li>
            <li> Perfect for all liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> BEST make up sponge ever. Give me such a natural look. Love it.</li>
            <li> It works so well evening out your makeup! I use it every time i need to put base on or even concealer, it makes it look like your makeup is effortless!</li>
            <li> I love my BeautyBlender sponge.  It really does leave my make-up looking more natural and radiant.  When I apply my liquid foundation with a brush or my fingers it tends to look heavier (obviously made up) but when I use my BeautyBlender sponge my skin looks flawless but natural. I&#x27;m so not going back, at least not for liquid make-up.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MINE, I GOT 2 WITH THE CLEANSER KIT. GET THE CLEANSER KIT SINCE ITS HARD TO WASH IT WITHOUT IT OR WITH OTHER STUFF.. THIS MAKES YOUR FOUNDATION LOOK SOO GOOD THAT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU GOT NO FOUNDATION ON..I DONT DAMP MINE AND IT STILL LOOKS GREEEATTTTTT</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Especially the blender cleanser. This actually cleans my brushes and the blender so quickly and thoroughly! too bad it smells a bit like my grandmother, though.</li>
            <li> Love the beauty blender! It gives ur face a glow n makeup lasts longer! Would recommend to anyone! Even got to of my friends to buy it and they love it</li>
            <li> I have heard about this product for quite some time, but hesitated to spend $30 on a set of sponges and some cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go for it, and I am glad that I did. I use this sponge to apply my tinted moisturizer, sometimes foundation, and most of all - to apply concealer to the eyelid and under-eye area. You can easily dab the product around creases by the nose, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a video that inspired me to finally purchase this product. Skip to 3:15 to see the blender, and to 3:50 to see her apply Illamasqua foundation as a concealer. AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and I agree that it is best to do very thin layers and let it dry and then add another layer, if necessary. I have good (but dry) skin, but I like how I can get things even with this sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only washed one of the blenders once thus far, so I am not yet sure how they hold up over time. I am not sure if one of these is supposed to be travel sized, and one full size, but they appear to be the same exact size. (I haven&#x27;t wet one of them yet.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is a nice size (5 oz.) and I will also use it to clean brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you keep the polka dot plastic insert in which to store the blender. I set it on top of my muji makeup drawers and just pop it in there to dry after I use/wash it.</li>
            <li> Makes application seamless . Blends make up beautifully . A must have in your personal and professional make up kit.</li>
            <li> The shape of these sponges is perfect for the application of makeup, but I always tend to end up with too much makeup on when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product for over a year it does what I need it to do it always gives me a flawless look. I will continue to buy this product unless something better comes out :) otherwise I&#x27;m sticking to the beauty blender</li>
            <li> Im so happy to have this product in my kit. I got it a great price (cheaper than most sites).</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this sponge at first, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it at all!! I use it for foundation, concealer, powder, cream or powder blushes..even highlighter. So you can do your face make up with only one sponge. Amazing!!! Great for traveling too if you don&#x27;t feel like carrying all your brushes..</li>
            <li> I used this today and it is amazing! feels like im not wearing any foundation and it looks natural! Must try this!!</li>
            <li> Had a fake Beauty Blender.  I had no idea what I was missing.  The cleanser is perfect for cleaning my brushes too.</li>
            <li> Great price for two beauty blenders and the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I hated this product at first, that was because I didn&#x27;t read the instructions on how to use/ clean it properly. After I used it correctly I loved it! You are supposed to apply the soap on the sponge while it&#x27;s dry, work the soap into the spots that are dirty, then rinse under water squeezing the soap out until there is no more soap. After the soap is gone, squeeze the excess water out. I like to then wrap it in a dry paper towel to remove the excess water then do my makeup. If you try to wash the makeup out of a wet beauty blender, some stains may remain. Let it dry dirty then wash before the next use</li>
            <li> This is a great little kit to get you started with the Beautyblender sponges.  I love it!  It has everything that I need.  These, in my opinion are the best makeup sponges on the market!  If you haven&#x27;t tried the Beautyblender and are thinking about it, I highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> I love my beauty blender. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on them. So I purchased them from here. It was a great bundle for cheaper here than on Sephora or Ulta. They came right on time and I absolutely love them. I have one and I gave the other one to my sister. It is wonderful to blend out foundation, and concealer. It is absolutely beautiful it gives me a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Love it! Worth the money</li>
            <li> These beauty blenders are great for applying make up.  Using them my make up goes on a lot smoother and lighter.  It is also convenient that it comes with the cleanser which smells good.  I actually use this cleanser for my brushes also.  A little tiny bit of this cleanser goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bummed I couldn&#x27;t wash out the stains. As much as it&#x27;s raved about, for what this costs I&#x27;d rather just use knockoffs or basic sponges.</li>
            <li> I really love how this blends my foundation. I have been using the foundation brushes for awhile now, but it doesnt leave a smooth finish like the blender does.  I love makeup products and this is a must for even the most novice artist.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the description says, the foundation looks flawless in all of my clients, very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I can n to tell you how much I love these make up sponges. They make my make up go on smoother and it makes it look much better. I have told all my friends about these sponges. You do need the cleanser to clean, if not the sponge gets hard so I clean my every day. It just takes a second to clean and well worth the extra step for great looking make up.</li>
            <li> I will never use a foundation brush again after using the beauty blender. Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BEAUTY BLENDER especially when I have dry skin bc it helps blend my bb cream/ cc cream/ foundation and it gives this dewy finish a brush can&#x27;t give. I helped hydrate my skin so whatever face product I use it won&#x27;t cling onto my dry skin  (when my skin is dry and flaky). OVERALL, I LOOOOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> loveeeeeeee this producttt!!! just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey but for 2 and the cleaner such a good buy and it works amazinggggg this is my favorite thing to use to apply my foundation get it get it get it</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I love the sponge. It makes you makeup looking fresh for many hours. I used to use my hands or brushes to apply make up but after only couple of hours I&#x27;d have to retouch my face. Using the make up I don&#x27;t have to do that almost all day. It looks like you spend hours doing your makeup. There is two things I didn&#x27;t like about the sponge:&lt;br /&gt;1) It wears out really fast (2 wks and it&#x27;s already falling apart)&lt;br /&gt;2) It uses more make up than a brush.&lt;br /&gt;If I buy this product again I&#x27;ll make sure I place my next order 2-3 wks after ordering a sponge to make sure I have a replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these before, but I purchased them from a big brand beauty store and paid almost twice as much to get each product separately. Ordering the double blender kit with the cleanser was such a great deal! I have tried so many sponges to blend my foundation ( I switch between a liquid and a mineral powder) so that it looks natural. The Beautyblender is definitely the best for this. It fits so easily into the corners of the nose and eyes and the tip is perfect for &amp;#34;erasing&amp;#34; any makeup mistakes. I like to wet the sponge first to get a light amount of coverage. It is extremely easy to use the pump on the cleanser to clean off the sponge. The only problem I have noticed is that the sponges seem to disintegrate over time. The more I&#x27;ve used it little pieces of the sponge break off. I can still use it though and as I ordered the double pack, I always have a back up.</li>
            <li> I am so amazed at the sponge, and how effortlessly it blends my liquid foundation.  However, the description promised 2 sponges and the seller only sent me one.  I am very disappointed and I hope to resolve this issue quickly. Below I included the description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&amp;#34;A great starter kit. This combo pack Includes; 2 beautyblenders, 1 blendercleanser&lt;br /&gt;Double your fun! Use 1 damp use the other 1 dry. Take one with you and keep the other safe at home.&lt;br /&gt;Washable, re-useable, recyclable. Can be used with all types of makeup. Use damp or dry. We prefer damp. Very versatile applicator.&lt;br /&gt;If you have problem skin Beautyblender works to cover blemishes. Use the pointed end and the stipple and twist technique for a perfect finish.&lt;br /&gt;blendercleanser - To be used to clean Beautyblender after every use. Specificly designed to maintain the integrity of your Beautyblender.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been buying beauty blenders for about 2 years now, and I love these, I recommend them to anyone who wears make up and I even recommend them to anyone just starting out with make up.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was a little skeptical of buying this at first because I thought that it was an insane price for a sponge. However, I received an amazon gift card and figured I might as well give it a shot. I am SO HAPPY that I did. I have fair, dry, and acne prone skin. This sponge makes my makeup go on flawlessly and makes my face look almost as if my makeup was airbrushed. It doesn&#x27;t make my dry patches stand out and I have had so many compliments on my makeup just in the first week that I have been using it. I noticed that a few people complained about the pink dye washing off onto their skin, but I am very fair complected and this never happened to me. One thing that I have noticed is that since you apply your makeup with the sponge damp, it is a bit moist for a while. I found that it helps a lot to use a light powder to set it. my makeup looked nice for about 10 hours, which is wonderful!! I haven&#x27;t tried cleaning it with other methods so I don&#x27;t know how well it cleans without the beauty blender cleanser, but the cleanser has a nice scent and seems to get most of the makeup out of the sponge. I love love love this product. I am so glad that I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Beautyblenders and cleanser for almost a year now. When I first tried them out, I was infatuated. However, I waited on writing this review because I wanted to have a little more \\&quot;blending time\\&quot; under my belt. Well, here I am a year later, and I can&#x27;t say enough about these pink spongy miracles. (Does that sum it up?) Here&#x27;s the rundown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t know how these little guys blend so well, but they provide even, **dewy** coverage. It looks like you are not wearing any foundation, even if you have to use a heavy concealer. Just be sure to dampen the sponge per the instructions. On the days when I&#x27;m in a rush and decide to mayyybe blend a little with my fingers, I can instantly tell the difference and immediately go back to the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The sponge&#x27;s shape is easy to use: you can cover large areas fast + get into small delicate areas, like under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You can blend with multiple foundation shades to your heart&#x27;s content (i.e. darker on your nose and lighter around the jaw line). I&#x27;ve also used multiple foundation weights: sheer, regular, and heavy concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You can have sheer coverage, or heavy coverage, by how much you dab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I loooove how the cleanser smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You will use a lot more foundation. (It&#x27;s worth it, though, in my opinion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The cleanser, while it smells delish, doesn&#x27;t do the best job at cleaning the sponges. It doesn&#x27;t lather well either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Makeup and pink dye will coat your sink when you clean the sponges. A spray bottle with 50% water / 50% vinegar takes it off in a flash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The cleanser dispenser isn&#x27;t very functional. One \\&quot;swoosh\\&quot; of the sponge in the basin, per the instructions, is never enough to clean the sponge. However, I love the smell of the cleanser so much that I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE FAKE!!! BUYER BEWARE!!! compared it to the one I actually bought from the department store and not even close. completely different texture.. size.. color... FAKE FAKE FAKE!&lt;br /&gt;NEVER AGAIN</li>
            <li> The beauty blenders give such a flawless finnish, i always use it damp...i dint see much benefit from it dry. This is my second time ordering them, i lost my first ine, also i havent used the cleaner before but decided to order it because my last one i didnt like how it felt after cleaning it with soap...i will update</li>
            <li> Love it!! Ever since i started using beauty blender, i feel bad leaving my brush alone:( its the best thing ever!!</li>
            <li> I really do like the cleanser. I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and have been using the Beauty Blender sponge for well over a year. I had been using hand soap to clean it with. The name brand cleanser does a MUCH better job. I could not believe the amount of makeup that came off the sponge. Seeing as it did so well on the sponge, I cleaned all my makeup brushes with it. Wow! Just wow. I felt like a dirty bird, let me tell you! What I thought was clean was not really quite so! All that used up my sample from Sephora. After googling DIY cleanser (because this stuff ain&#x27;t cheap) I decided the Beauty Blender Cleanser was worth the money. This double sponge pack is quite the deal. Amazon saves the day once more.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love it! Definitely get the cleaner.</li>
            <li> these are not real beauty blenders</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this handy tool. It gives you a flawless finish with any quality foundation you use! I was very frustrated with the look of my foundation. I had tried the expensive foundation paint brush but it did not look good at all. I will be using beautyblender from now on!</li>
            <li> Although it takes a bit more time than my usual applicator, the Beautyblender leaves an incredible air brush like finish! Contouring and highlighting, cream foundations or liquid, it does it all. I love this sponge. The cleaner works wonderfully on all of your makeup brushes as well. Great price. I saw one sponge in another store for $20. This pack is a great savings.</li>
            <li> Item was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Love these beauty blenders!! They make my makeup look flawless and not cakey. The cleaner is amazing for not only the beauty blender itself but even my brushes!!! I will defiantly be ordering more</li>
            <li> The sponges work great.  Way over priced at $35.      1/7/16:  Updated review from 3 to 4 stars.  Seems that most stores are selling this product at or near the same price.</li>
            <li> This is a ridiculously good deal, it is a steal!! do not even think about it, the blender is amazing and i truly feel the cleanser is a must have.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I&#x27;ve been using this brand sponges for 4 years now and yes I&#x27;ve tried dupes but there is no other sponge out there like this one. Well worth the price, last a very long time but you should repurchase between 6-9 months, you know bacteria build up. DEF BUY! Seller was authentic and shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li> Omg nothing compares to this. Off brands are not as soft. The best beauty blender ever! And what a steal! Best price.</li>
            <li> Beautyblender is a great tool, the cleanser gets dirty really easily and sometimes hard to pump. Hopefully the beauty blender cleanser in the solid form is better!</li>
            <li> Love my beauty blenders! The cleanser seems to be the only thing that cleans them though!</li>
            <li> These guys have changed the way I do my makeup, and more importantly the way it looks when I&#x27;m done! I use them to apply foundation followed by concealer, and it always always always looks flawless and perfectly blended. I used to use either a brush or one of those old school white sponges, but I will always go to my beauty blender from here on out. Easy to use, easy to clean (way easier than washing my foundation brush and waiting for it to dry). Give this a try!,,</li>
            <li> I am completley amazed with this product. I can honestly say that this is hands down the best product to apply foundation, cream blush, concealer, and pretty much any other formula. The Beauty Blender is easy to use and creates the most flawless application. I wear this mostly to apply my foundation and my concealer. I have also used it to apply cream blushes and I love it. I can&#x27;t see myself applying my foundation/concealer any other way EVER again. Do not hesitiate to buy this product. This is the best beauty investment i have ever made. Thanks Amazon&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else every again. This product is amazing and makes your face look flawless. GET ONE NOW!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the sponges! I can&#x27;t believe what a difference they make! I even use the sponge with my 3lab foundation - which is a miracle in itself - so double effect!! But, the cleanser is nothing spectacular. I used it and it was fine no big deal. I also tried my own facial cleanser and it did the same job, maybe even better. As long as your cleanser isn&#x27;t cream based, I would think you could use a dab of your own cleanser. I would have rather spent the money on another beauty blender.</li>
            <li> My daughter watches how to videos and came across this product. I ordered it for Christmas for her and it was a big hit!</li>
            <li> I bought this and a Beauty Blender from Sephora, since I read a bunch of reviews saying this was a fake.  If it is, I can&#x27;t tell.  The one from Sephora seems to be the exact same as the one I bought on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve used them both and can&#x27;t tell a difference at all.  They&#x27;re awesome.  I always used my fingers to apply foundation and never understood how big a difference it makes.  When I use my fingers, my foundation ends up looking caked on, my skin feels greasy, and I look about 10 years older. I always thought it was a foundation problem and kept trying new ones, with no luck. Using the blender, my skin looks dewy and fresh and I don&#x27;t need powder.  Just make sure you get the blender wet first, then squeeze it out, before applying foundation.  It makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all I&#x27;m very picky but this product exceeded my expectations I won&#x27;t even apply foundation with a brush anymore. Remember to spray the little sponge with a bit of water or makeup staying product and you&#x27;ll get even better results.</li>
            <li> I had tried many other soaps before this one to clean my beauty blander but this one is by far the best. It really cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave residue. It also has a nice scent, smells like lavender and tea tree.</li>
            <li> The cleanser I received didn&#x27;t come with the dispenser head as shown in the picture. The bottle is stiff and it&#x27;s hard to squeeze the cleanser out. I would be happy if it came with the dispenser. Unhappy!</li>
            <li> I spent years as a makeup artist working at Sephora, and I was given free products all the time. This is by far the best foundation application method on the market. Nothing blends as good as this! Furthermore, it holds up better than any of the knock off sponges. I bought one from walgreens and it feel apart after about a month. I think I&#x27;ve still been using this one for about four months now and it still looks great! The cleanser is good, too. But I think I got one with the old flip top packaging instead of the pump and it sucks. I wish I got the pump packaging instead. All in all its a good cleanser and an excellent sponge!</li>
            <li> great product, great timming, great usage.&lt;br /&gt;workes exactly as described and i am overall very satisfied with my purchase, thanks!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cleaner was yellow in color and smells old. One of my sponges did get a little rip in them already and i havent had it for a month yet. But i will say, the coverage of my makeup last ALL DAY LONG, I never have to touch up my foundtaion now if im going out after work...maybe just under my eyes, but half the time not even that. So minus those two issues i mentioned (which are kind of big especially for the price i paid) sponge is great.</li>
            <li> I rate this just okay. I think the best use for this is blush. I will not repurchase, kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Beauty Blender is a great product! I always get a flawless appearance after applying my liquid foundation!! I wish I had invented this!</li>
            <li> Perfect sponge for foundation!</li>
            <li> Love love love the beauty blender! However mine fell apart after a few uses!</li>
            <li> this product makes liquid base application a breeze. its easy to use and blends the base extremely well. id highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this with MAC full coverage foundation. I first apply the foundation to my face with a large concealer brush then blend it with my damp beautyblender and it blends perfectly!</li>
            <li> I already owned one Beauty Blender, and I bought this combo because I loved the first Blender that much! This combo is the best bang for your buck- I paid $19.99 for my first Blender alone, and for $30 some odd bucks, I got 2 Blenders and the cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word on the cleanser- believe the reviews that say it works! I was SO reluctant to buy the cleanser because I was certain I could get it clean without it... and I was WRONG. I tried MANY cleansers, face washes, soaps, etc., and the only thing that worked was dish soap (saw this on another Amazon review)... but I felt like the dish soap would eventually degrade the Blender. I had not washed my Blender in a few days, and I used the cleanser for the first time today... and with 3-4 pumps of the cleanser, plus a little warm water- and my cleanser looked BRAND NEW. No lie! It look at least 5 minutes of washing with the dish soap to accomplish what the cleanser accomplished in less than 2 minutes. And the smell is fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion- this product is worth every penny! The Blender is the best makeup sponge I have ever used (read all the reviews of the Blender if you want more details on that), and the cleanser is definitely worth the money. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- I read on another review that sometimes it is easier to clean the Blender if you let it dry after you apply makeup, and wash it later in the day/the next morning. I agree!! Trying to wash it right after use is time-consuming and takes more effort. Just let it dry and wash it before bed, and it will be ready for use the next day.</li>
            <li> Great and fast shipping. I love how it was package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this because its just makes my foundation look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;i never use liquid foundation because it would make my face all cakey&lt;br /&gt;but not with this beauty blender it makes it so much easier. Very flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather use my beauty blender then my mac brushes!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product its something i can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> SUCH a good deal to buy on Amazon and the product itself is amazing. Would and probably will buy again!</li>
            <li> Wish I had not wasted time/ money on dupes.... this is SO MUCH BETTER!!!!  Perfect application.&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER THOUGH:  Works best when used with NON-water based foundations.  I have seen lots of reviews that say &amp;#34;used so much product&amp;#34;... Not so if you use an oil based foundation.  My fav is MAC full coverage cream foundation, I use LESS with a wet beauty blender than a brush or regular sponge.</li>
            <li> So happy!! I can&#x27;t live without a BB and when I saw this deal I took advantage. Shipping was fast and I did not realize  they were giving such a large bottle of the cleanser (5 fl oz).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it!Not good as cd blushes</li>
            <li> Product came broken I was unable to contact seller...</li>
            <li> These sponges are simple the best when coming to apply foundation! The finish is incredible! It is just a little difficult to clean it, but the blendercleanser does a better job than the other regular cleansers I used to use before purchasing this combo.</li>
            <li> I bought this beauty blender at Sephora so I can&#x27;t comment on the seller of the site.  The Beauty Blender is amazing. I thought everyone was just hopping on a fad and I bought a few no name brands and they were really stiff and dry and they seemed to have absorbed a lot of the foundation, but not with the beauty blender.  It leaves an amazing clean finish.  My entire face looked flawless and there wasn&#x27;t any lines or inconsistencies, everything just sort of spreads out evenly.  My routine before was I would put either a moisturizer or a primer, sometimes on special occasions both then let it dry or pat dry with a tissue.  Then I would take my foundation brush and smear foundation all over my face, blend a little with a knock off blender or a kabuki brush, then I would put a super light concealer under my eyes and contour the rest of my face then blend again either with a kabuki brush or the knock off brushes.  I do the same now except it takes me much less time to blend everything together and I cut out the smearing foundation all over my face with a foundation brush.  I can just pick some up on the sponge or put it on my face in a few dots and spread out with the blender.  I love this thing! The only con I do have is that it is way overpriced for one tiny sponge.  I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s going to last me, but I can get a brush for 20 dollars and it&#x27;ll last me for 10 years, the beauty blender will last for probably 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li> I loved the beauty blender. It&#x27;s so soft, gives an airbrush look, easy to use, easy to clean, and the cleaner can be used for regular brushes as well. I love this and highly recommend it for anyone who wants an airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I just don&#x27;t like the whole cleaning technique it&#x27;s takes to long. So I only used my on special occasion .</li>
            <li> I first learned of the Beautyblender from reading Jessica Alba&#x27;s book, The Honest Life. She says makeup can look clownish and gross if you apply it with your fingers. That saddened me, since I have mostly always used my fingertips for applying concealer. I had, at some point in the past, bought a M.A.C concealer brush, but it just caked it on and gave a weird texture, so I reverted to using my fingers. When Jessica raved in her book about how great the Beautyblender is, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM SO GLAD I DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made a HUGE difference... the concealer doesn&#x27;t just sit on my face in semi-noticeable spots now. The blender creates a nice, smooth BLENDED finish, making skin look flawless! it doesn&#x27;t soak up the makeup or smudge it all off when dabbing (like using my finger would!). It is smooth and soft to the touch, and does not give me that cringe-y feeling I normally get when touching typical foam. I use the tiny end to apply my spot concealer, and the rounded end to apply a finishing powder (which also blends it much nicer than my kabuki brush ever could!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash it with the provided cleanser after every use; it only needs one pump and some water. Rub/squish between hands, rinse, and store. It does a fine job of cleansing the blender of all makeup and oil residue so that it&#x27;s fresh for next time. The cleanser has a nice mild lavender scent which I was afraid would be too strong, but it&#x27;s pretty subtle. The blender did bleed some pink colour during the first several washings, but It never bled on my face during actual application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember during the first week doing double takes when I saw myself in a mirror. My skin just looks so much more even and flawless (even though it is certainly NOT under the makeup)! it&#x27;s amazing what a difference a little pink sponge can make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be using this blender for life.</li>
            <li> SOAKS UP YOUR MAKEUP MORE THAN IT IS PUTTING ON YOUR FACE WHICH IN TURN IS SOAKING UP YOUR MONEY!  MAKEUP IS NOT CHEAP!!!</li>
            <li> Have tried this product many times before and actually bought this kit as a Christmas gift!  Fast shipping is much appreciated!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Legit perfect! I love these and the cleanser!!</li>
            <li> leaves my skin looking flawless i love this! :)</li>
            <li> I prefer not to use brushes at all when applying makeup, ESPECIALLY with foundation/BB cream. The Beauty Blender makes it really easy and nice to apply foundation, and although I prefer using make-up remover and bar soap to clean brushes, the cleanser is really nice and easy to use! Would totally purchase both if needed next time.</li>
            <li> I thought a sponge is a sponge is a sponge. Wrong. This little make up sponge is amazing. I dampen the sponge first and then use it to apply foundation. I&#x27;m actually saving money because the Beautyblender applies the make up evenly and it&#x27;s unique shape gets into the curves and contours of my face. I can&#x27;t believe I spent that for a sponge but I&#x27;m sure glad I did. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> These are great for foundation. The application is easy and the look is smooth.</li>
            <li> I have spend lots of money on imitation blenders. There are no substitutes...none that I found yet...from the high end make sponges to the target ones to the dollar store ones...nothing comes close. Leaves any foundation looking flawless on your skin...from the superstar no rub off foundation to the glory skin foundation to the oil control foundation buy it if you wear foundation every day like me :)</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I was a bit hesitant to spend this kind of money for the Beauty Blender because there are so many similar products that cost waaay less. However, now that I have it I see that none compares! If you want to have that airbrushed look and blend your make up like a dream, THIS IS IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add that I was a bit shocked by the size. These ones seem small. But they get the job done nonetheless.</li>
            <li> This is not authentic. I have to give it one star because it&#x27;s fake.. It is smaller than the actual beauty blender. The foundation does not go on smoothly as the real beauty blender. When you apply foundation on the fake one... It doesn&#x27;t rub on smooth and evenly. It sucks all the foundation on the sponge. Do not buy this product! It is not worth it.</li>
            <li> They are TINY&amp;#62; Not true to picture.</li>
            <li> IN LOVE WITH MY BEAUTYBLENDER!!! Soap is great just a little drop goes a long way for cleaning product. I do RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the suggestion of my daughter. We love this sponge much more than our stippling brush. The finish is perfect. If I had to say one negative thing it would be that I use more foundation now, but that&#x27;s true of any sponge.</li>
            <li> the beauty blender is great for applying liquid foundation you have to use it wet for best results. It never leaves any lines or streaks, to clean wait for it to be completely dry then clean with the cleanser. My only complaint is that it does seem to absorb the foundation so i have to use a little more foundation then usual.</li>
            <li> I love the beauty blender!! Always leaves a flawless finish. Looks like you got airbrushed  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It started tearing apart while washing it for the first time. I don&#x27;t see why this item costs so much. However, I do like the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Just what we needed to have and at a very great price. Definitely recommend this to all of you looking for this.</li>
            <li> The beauty blenders themselves are absolutely great and I will be purchasing more soon.  My only issue is that I couldn&#x27;t get the cleansing solution to come out of the bottle at all and had to screw off the top to use it.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing the solid cleanser next time.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!! Very good product! Totally worth it</li>
            <li> this little pink tear drop of joy has changed my makeup routine. Make up in the more has become effortless for me. I use one for me and one for my pro makeup kit. i will be buying more. i had to water down the cleanser a bit. i couldn&#x27;t get a good lather and had used half the bottle. Once i watered it down it cleans up licky split.</li>
            <li> Love the Beauty Blender for liquid makeup.  Does what everyone says it does.  This kit was a very good value.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Beauty Blender, however this one broke (I didn&#x27;t think a sponge could break!) after just a few uses. I am somewhat disappointed, because the last BB lasted me for months.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She loves makeup and accesseries.  She loves the Beauty Blender, this is her second one to buy..</li>
            <li> I hate the feel of makeup, so the beauty blender is perfect for light and even applications. Plus this deal just can&#x27;t be beat. I clean mine after every use and use the cleaner very sparingly, it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> After hearing so much about them, I finally gave in a decided to see if Beauty Blenders are all they’re cracked up to be. I got two BB’s with the liquid cleanser for $30 which seemed like a great deal compared to what they sell for individually. Overall, I can see what all the hype is about, however, like any product, they have flaws. I have been using Revlon ColorStay Foundation which completely and totally stains BB’s! I have read MANY reviews of this happening with ColorStay with other people as well, so I get it’s the foundation fault, not the BB’s. I had only had it for a week and was just been rinsing with water after each use, so I think to myself, “Time to whip out the cleaner and see if I can get some of the leftover color out.” I put the cleanser on the BB and very gently massaged it and worked the soap in and it didn’t seem to make much of a difference. So, I then took advice off of BB’s website to soak it in water with the cleanser if you have stubborn stains. So I let it sit for about 8 hours while I was at work, came home and started to rinse it and GENTLY massage the soap out and the whole thing started to fall apart!!! It started with a tiny tear at the wide base and then just started to crumble! I was being very gentle and don’t have very long or sharp nails that it could get caught on or anything. I was so disappointed! However, since I still had the second one I thought I would give it one more chance. This one has lasted a lot longer and held up much better! I had been alternating between the BB and my brushes, but recently bought Hard Candy’s Glamoflauge Foundation, which ends up being very streaky when using brushes and I can only use the BB with. Basically I have just been doing trial and error but I am overall impressed with the coverage it provides, and well as the finish. The cleanser works well on the BB (aside from that stubborn ColorStay) and I also use it on my brushes with great results! When it is my current BBs time to go, I will probably only re-buy if on sale, since I’d rather not drop a ton of money on a sponge that might fall apart right away.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!! Goes on beautifully and blends very well! The cleanser is awesome too! Does a great job at cleaning makeup brushes also!!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve Been able to use the Beauty Blender for a month, I feel I can provide a priper review. The delivery was smooth and prompt. It came when expected and I truly appreciate excellent Customer Service. I&#x27;ve had brushes from Sephora, Sigma and MAC. None of them give the finish and longevity that the Beauty Blender does. I find that after using the beauty blender for my foundation and concealer, I look very natural, almost as though I didn&#x27;t even put any makeup on. Not to mention I save A LOT of product and I know my expensive foundation will stay with me longer until I finally run out. Quick tip: from the bottle, apply your foundation with your index or middle finger in a dotted motion. Once on the forehead, both cheeks, nose and chin. Start pressing and spreading with the beauty blender and you&#x27;ll see the coverage it provides as well as how much foundation you&#x27;ll actually need which shouldn&#x27;t be a lot. Also, the cleanser is phenomenal! I absolutely LOVE the way it cleans the beauty blender as well as my brushes! The stains from my brushes that I thought were permanent from foundations, lip colors, eye creams or concealers have all been completely washed away! I normally use the Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo and though it smells better than the beauty blender cleanser, I now feel as though my blender and the brushes are thoroughly washed and cleaned. The amount they provide as quite substantial too. Best investment and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This beauty blender has been a great purchase. I love the way it blends my foundation and the way it sets my powder. This is a must have.</li>
            <li> This sponge is sturdy and easy to use. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t absorb foundation. It&#x27;s versatile. I love it and will order more once I run out. I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Never used a blending sponge before, so I was a little reluctant to buy this.  After reading tons of reviews, I went for it and am so happy I did.  Very easy to use and the cleanser works great on brushes as well.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!! what can I say but awesome....the finish is perfect and flawless with liquid and cream and I&#x27;m still mastering the powder and mineral.  I use much less of my product and the cleanser is nice as well with a pleasant herbal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: when cleansing the sponge soak it with water don&#x27;t squeeze out the excess add the cleaner and squeeze and massage the sponge and cleanser together with 2 or 3 fingers at a time on both sides squeezing out water as you do this and you&#x27;ll see all the foundation come&#x27;s out if I used it for a lot that day than i have to clean it like that more than once and but the sponges always come clean and look new again...</li>
            <li> All time favorite love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item 3 or four times, each time I got the same item and each time the item was wrong, it is suppose to have a spray unit in it but it didn&#x27;t come the way it is pictured.</li>
            <li> At first I was sceptical because I thought brushes work just as well, if not better, boy I was wrong.  The first time I used the beauty blender, my family and friends from school noticed  how flawless my faced looked. They asked me if I was using a new foundation, or a new face wash. I told them about the beauty blender and that that was the new product I was using. They were so shocked and my sister said she would buy the second one from me lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable. I split the amount with my sister so it didn&#x27;t seem a lot for a good product. I definitely recommend this product to all the girls :))</li>
            <li> saw this by luck...and did my research and decided to give it a try.  i&#x27;m usually don&#x27;t wear make up... but the first time i used this...i&#x27;m in love!  i couldn&#x27;t ever put on my foundation on this evenly or make it seem this flawless.</li>
            <li> I will never apply my foundation with brushes again... The beauty blender is great! After you have applied your makeup and are set and ready to go wet the sponge again and rinse it then go over your face again it leaves a beautiful finish...</li>
            <li> Hmmm.. I will have to stay this is great as I bought it for my wife, and she didn&#x27;t yell at me!</li>
            <li> Have not used this product yet but I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things so I&#x27;m excited to use it. Fast shipping but a little pricey for this thing</li>
            <li> Was delivered on time, and it was a great deal!</li>
            <li> Love the blenders! And love that it came with 2 blenders and a cleaner. Don&#x27;t use it too often because I don&#x27;t hav a lot of time to get ready in the morning.. But they definitely work great!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried the Blender sponge and feel like throwing away my make-up brushes. Excellent blending! Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this blender cuts my make up time in half! Don&#x27;t have to worry if I have a full coverage because the blender does the work for you. Would buy again and again and recommend to anyone. A big plus is the cleaner that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this.  I use the beauty blenders mostly for blending in my under eye concealer.  I haven&#x27;t mastered using them for foundation, but I think I prefer a brush for that anyway.  The cleanser works really well for the beauty blenders as well as my brushes.  Getting this as a package is a great deal and I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in trying beauty blenders or who just want to stock up.</li>
            <li> Great deal for 2 beauty blenders and the daily cleaner. I was already a big fan of beauty blenders before - they really do give your skin a flawless &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look.  I&#x27;ve found that cleaning the sponge daily really helps extend it&#x27;s life, so finding a deal with two blenders, plus a generous bottle of the cleaner was a win-win.  I also use the cleaner for powder puffs and occasionally makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I i i i i i i I love this makeup. makes your face smoother no lines helps makeup into pores  younger look</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Product was tossed around a bit one of the sponges was loose in the box but still in perfect condition. They work amazingly. I love how flawless my skin looks after applying my foundation with these! I have bought several before from sephora, but Amazon shipped so much faster. These are not fake they are the real deal!</li>
            <li> This beauty blender is magic for applying liquid and powder make up, gives a flawless airbrushed finish. I will re- order.</li>
            <li> awesome pack and way cheaper than at sephora (where this bundle is always sold out anyways)</li>
            <li> every thing was great .. it come on the time ..same of pic..just the taxes was so much</li>
            <li> I ordered two sets of these. One set for my sister and one for myself. Well, the blender balls seemed ok from the outside but once I wet them like the instructions say, one of them expanded into double its size beautifully. The second one remained small. This makes me wonder if I received a real and a fake. So, basically I paid double the price for one good piece. This is the third time I ordered with you and I hadn&#x27;t had any problems before :/</li>
            <li> This is the best price out there and I LOVE the cleanser kit. I use the cleaning wash to clean ALL my brushes and love the faint lavender smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was converted to the beautyblender a long time ago and was so happy when I found this steal.</li>
            <li> The Beautyblender has become a staple in my morning routine. This blender can literally make ANYTHING look good. If you ever look at yourself and think &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know how I feel about how that looks...&amp;#34; take the blender to it. The kit is extremely convenient and I recommend it highly for those purchasing this tool for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes in a small, clear, rectangle box with the beauty blender packaging in the circle container as shown and the cleanser right along side of it. Truthfully, my blender rarely sees the inside of the packaging it came in. The cleanser sits opposite of my hand soap in my bathroom and the blender is typically always on top of the pedestal inside of the cleanser drying from when I cleaned it last. However, I can see the packaging being a nice storage place for everything too. (Packaging is super important to me because I tend to repurpose it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the cleanser and I&#x27;m glad that I purchased this kit with one provided. As with anything, the tool gets dirty and needs to be cleaned. The cleanser that comes with this kit is great- it cleans well, has minimal to no scent, and doesn&#x27;t leave any apparent residue on the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the sponges, I think that they are made very well and having two comes in handy. There are times where I grab for the other one because one of my blenders is dirty and I forgot to clean it. Cleaning the blender is SUPER important. It doesn&#x27;t give off an odor or anything but you will see that if you let it go too long without a nice clean the effectiveness will go with it. Cleaning it will fix that right up. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star for two reasons: one, when I first got the blender I tore some holes in the top from my nails. While I haven&#x27;t noticed any differences from the scratches (I&#x27;m not sure what you would call them!) I was hoping it would be a littleeee more durable than that. Secondly, the cleanser is great but the packaging leaves more to be desired. Pumping out the cleanser can be a pain. I was using the pedestal that comes with it to dry the blender on top of as a way to push out the cleanser but it just made a mess. Now, I have to use my finger nails and push down on the outer rim of the smallll litttle circle. I definitely think (and hope) that this will be improved in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used the small make-up sponges that you can get anywhere and never thought I&#x27;d like using a sponge. The BeautyBlender is fantastic. My make-up looks great. It makes coverage better and doesn&#x27;t use as much as I do when using a brush. I also noticed it makes it easier to get in around my eyes without getting the concealer or foundation into the rims of my eyes. Love this product.  &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This cleanser that comes with the sponges is terrific!  I was using soap to clean my sponges and unfortunately I accidentally ripped off the pointed tip.  With this cleanser, it is so gentle and cleans the sponge easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using these Beauty Blenders and stippling foundation and/or foundation on..... covers a multitude of age!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!! All makeup guru will agree that beauty blenders are an important item in all makeup artist or collectors. :-) I highly recommend :-)</li>
            <li> This product makes applying makeup so easy, and so natural appearing!  Love it!  Plan to buy again and have suggested it to others.</li>
            <li> I had avoided liquid foundation as an adult because of horrible memories from high school of looking spackled instead of dewy. But after a makeup consultation at Sephora, I ended up purchasing Make Up Forever water-based foundation, which matches my skin perfectly and goes on extremely light (it also smells faintly of rosewater, making it extra lovely!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I needed a makeup sponge, and was loathe to buy those little white round or square ones -- I hate the way they become so discolored from use and everything about them just feels &amp;#34;not fresh&amp;#34; to me. When I saw these, with their nice egg shape and hot pink color, I thought I&#x27;d give them a shot, and they are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is amazing, and gets the foundation right out, so the sponge stays a nice bright pink and never feels dirty. And the sponges themselves are fantastic. I use one wet for overall coverage, and then use the dry one to dab a bit extra under my eyes or anywhere else that needs a bit more attention. The end result is great. They&#x27;re totally worth the money, and the little plastic container they come in makes it easy to pack for travel as well.</li>
            <li> I love and love my beautyblender, I love make up and I  have so many different type of foundation brushes but no nothing come close for the perfect finish the beautyblender give me. If you used foundation you most get the beautybender</li>
            <li> Not sure that these do any better than any other smooth, make-up sponge. The cleanser definitely is no better that just squirting on hand soap on a sponge.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t get it.  It is just a sponge.  BUT this sponge is like no other.  It truly gives my foundation a perfect application.  I&#x27;ve used my fingertips, foundation brushes, stipler brushes, knock-off BB sponges, and nothing beats this BeautyBlender!  I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I hadn&#x27;t caved and bought the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t explain why the BeautyBlender is the best foundation applicator I have found, because it makes absolutely no sense to me.  But if you haven&#x27;t purchased one yet because you are thinking &amp;#34;it&#x27;s just a sponge - it can&#x27;t be that great&amp;#34;, then you just need to take the plunge like I did and it will make a believer out of you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cleanser that comes with it?  It is fine.  I don&#x27;t know if your own brush cleanser or baby shampoo would work just as well.  I just thought if I was going for it, I would go all out - and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The best way to put on your makeup ever!!! Used for 1st time today. Amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Flawless touch to the makeup. I use it everyday and get compiments on my clear skin! This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> the item said: 2 beautyblenders, 1 blendercleanser, beautyblender portibility pouch, 1 sample of blendercleanser, instruction cards., plus the bottle of cleanser said that it comes with a pedestal to dry the beauty blender but I didnt get anything like that, yet I get two sponges and the cleanser but nothing else. I tried to contact the vendor but there is not way to do it. No happy with this</li>
            <li> OMG I just love this product, it is so beyond to just a sponge.. I saw all the reviews at Youtube and it is amazing, you just should be carefull with the right care of the sponge but it just works so nice... I bought a copy and there&#x27;s not comparison between, this product it is just perfect, I will buy the micro...</li>
            <li> I find that the beautyblender really speeds up the process of putting on foundation if you only use one layer. Makes the second layer really cakey. Also do not work well with powders. And I like full coverage and this thins out the foundation. I also use this with a Korean BB Cream-did not work as well as using fingers. It is good and convenient, but not as magical as they hype seemed to be.&lt;br /&gt;The beautycleanser is amazing though! It gets all the products out. My blender still got stained and the pink fades though it is clean.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge it gives a flawless finish ...thee only down fall of it is that the foundation stains the sponge and wont come off  but other then that i love it!(:</li>
            <li> While I was apprehensive about spending so much on sponges, I really don&#x27;t like liquid foundation much.  When I use this beauty blender it gives me much better coverage and I use less liquid foundation plus it doesn&#x27;t feel or look so heavy and it doesn&#x27;t settle in my lines. I love this sponge. I read people had trouble with the pink bleeding onto their skin and it crumbling. I haven&#x27;t had any problems. The cleaner seems fine but I can&#x27;t tell if its entirely effective because the color is still on my sponge but it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is actual residue left after cleansing. I&#x27;ll continue to use it for sure. One more thing....if you use a foundation that has adjustable coverage by applying it twice in certain areas, you&#x27;ll probably find this sponge very effective in application.</li>
            <li> The Beautyblender is terrific but the liquid cleanser that came with it does not work. I wish I had gotten the solid cleanser which is terrific. Otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars since I faithfully use the sponge everyday for flawless Lancome makeup application.</li>
            <li> Beauty blenders are awesome! There is no comparison between these and the budget beauty sponges. Just buy it, its worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Love this make up sponge. I have always been a brush person but this sponge changes the way your make up looks. You use minimal amount of makeup and you are able to spread it evently across your entire face.</li>
            <li> Great product! Just wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> In love! My last beauty blender broke in half so i was looking for a replacement. I was really ify about buying this out of fear it wasn&#x27;t authentic. I purchased this and it&#x27;s an original. The price is AMAZING for 2 AND cleaner..shipping was fast as well. I def recoomend.</li>
            <li> I mean, yeah, it&#x27;s a cool sponge but not that much better than other copies. Will not buy again, just too expensive</li>
            <li> For years I have heard the raves on youtube about the beauty blender, and I wasn&#x27;t ready to put out the money for one. I got a great deal on this. I&#x27;ve been using the beauty blender for a couple months, and I really like it so far. The soap isn&#x27;t the best cleaner I prefer to just use dawn dish soap works better in my opinion. The sponge really does blend my make up really well.</li>
            <li> I love it its awesome so is the cleaner 😄</li>
            <li> Makes putting foundation on so much easier. I just use the stipple effect and it feels light and airy. I agree with another reviewer - I don&#x27;t clean it until it&#x27;s dry. When it&#x27;s dirty and I&#x27;m ready to put make up on, I dab a little cleaner on and get it wet. It seems to clean up easier that way. I&#x27;d totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. I&#x27;ve bought from sephora before and they are the exact same ones at a better price.</li>
            <li> I was contemplating for quite sometime if I should get this since the price is a tad bit ridiculous for a sponge, but I had to see what the hype was about. Honestly, by far the best investment I&#x27;ve made when comes to beauty products. It gives a flawless finish, it works way better then my fingers and my foundation brushes. This is definitely an item every girl should have and the beauty blender cleanser is great too. I find it works better when the beauty blender is completely dry and then I apply the cleanser to my beauty blender with a tad bit of water and it takes the product right off. Hope this helps (:</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as to whether a make-up sponge could actually be worth the cost of the Beauty Blender. I&#x27;ve been using mine now for about two months. Clean up is a breeze. Just a few drops of the cleaner is enough to do the job. The sponge is soft,  and just the perfect size so that it&#x27;s not bulky to hold. The tip of the teardrop shape is great for blending concealer and foundation in the corner of the eyes and around the nose. It doesn&#x27;t soak up a huge amount of foundation like cheap sponges do, and it dries quickly. After over two months of use,  it&#x27;s still in great shape.  I&#x27;m impressed. .</li>
            <li> I wanted to know what the hype was, and let me say that the hype is RIGHT! These sponges are amazing. Really perfect your makeup. I love them. Easy to use, easy to clean, and carry on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the soap/shampoo, my favorite part about it is using it on my make up brushes. They really get cleaned in less washes than normally, and they are truly clean and fresh. I recommend it, even if it is just to clean your current brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this invention! I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Cleaner works great and i love the sponge. Application in pretty much flawless. The only think i dont love is having to rub the sponge to clean. The tip of the sponge is already starting to break down a bit :(</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money. Save your money and time and all the excitement of waiting for it to arrive... IT&#x27;S FAKE!!!! First of all the 2 sponges were different shades of pink. They were also smaller than the original. I also noticed they had rings at the bottom. I REAL beautyblender will not be like this! I will be returning this item. If it seems too good to be true its because it is... BIG DISSAPOINTMENT</li>
            <li> These are real the real beautyblenders. Mine came with 2 regular sized blenders and the cleaning stuff. Cleaning stuff had opened in the box before arrival but not biggy, didn&#x27;t make a big mess. I love using these on my dry skin!</li>
            <li> I was expecting the sponges to be A bit bigger. They did arrive on time but the liquid was not closed right so it spilled.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life!  I don&#x27;t apply my make up without it. It is a must have in your kit. ..the cleanser is amazing.</li>
            <li> When I wear foundation this is an incredible tool. Love it</li>
            <li> Thank u for speed shimpend</li>
            <li> I have been using the Beauty Blender for a few years now and I cannot do my makeup without it! I know most use it for foundation however I found it most useful for me to buff out my concealer with. It gives my under eye coverage and highlight a flawless well blended coverage and though I apply my foundation with a brush, I go over it with the BeautyBlender for an all over buffed out effect. My order lasted me 3 years and I just recently has to repurchase because it was getting old and tattered up. I was a little disappointed to see my new one ripped a bit so quickly near the tip after only a few months however it still works fine and this comes in two which is perfect. The cleanser is great as well and really gets the make up out of the blender. Definitely a must have in any makeup kit, professional or not.</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Forget using those cheap sponges. The beauty blender is the only way to apply your makeup. Some items are worth paying extra!</li>
            <li> I like the product but the beautyblender cleaner doesn&#x27;t clean the makeup off the sponge. I&#x27;m still learning how do use the beautyblender sponge.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge! I just did wedding makeup for 5 people yesterday using this. The skin ranged from mature to supple (the mother of the bride, the bride and her younger sisters) and the result for everyone was flawless airbrushed looking skin. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this blender!!!! The best tool for your Foundation and conceler aplication, gives you perfectly smuth flawless airbrush look. Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> Im extremely satisfied. I love these lil too big pink spongies. I enjoy cleaning them its pretty fun. My face looks flawless after I use it and get so many compliments. It doesnt cake up makes u look fab :)</li>
            <li> Changed my life with liquid foundation! The finish is wonderful! It&#x27;s smooth and easy! The cleaner works well!</li>
            <li> I think you end up using a little bit more with beauty blenders than brushes, but I think it is easier to get a more natural sheer look with these beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> I love the blender for applying my foundation.  Use to apply the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; way before and I agree the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; way is far better.&lt;br /&gt;but the cleaner is not 100% proof.  The sponge stay stain after a short period of time.  I still use the soap as I believe that bacteria and make up don&#x27;t go hand in hand.  Glad I bought it</li>
            <li> Delivery to the door. Goods as promised</li>
            <li> I had tried a similar sponge in design without knowing how to use it appropriately or clean it. I loved this package, as it provides to sponges, instructions on use, and the cleanser. Using the sponges makes make-up go on so smoothly, and you use so little of the product compared to other modes. And the design of the cleanser bottle makes cleaning even easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but the sponge doesn&#x27;t have the effect on my face as it did the first couple uses. The sponges seem to be a little worn out now and I only have had the product for two months. But the cleanser does wonders for the sponges and brushes!</li>
            <li> Its a must for makeup kits and the cleanser is a lot bigger than I thought!!</li>
            <li> A good deal for two beauty blenders and the cleanser! I love beauty blenders and will continue to repurchase them until they&#x27;re no longer made. They&#x27;re especially wonderful for people with dry skin because of the moisture being pressed into the skin with whichever product you choose to use on the blender. I apply my moisturizer, primers, and concealer with the pink ones and foundation and any cream bronzing with the black one (ordered separately). and it&#x27;s also great to set your foundation with powders in the areas that tend to crease because you&#x27;re pressing it into the product! I wash mine before every single use-which is really important because it does soak up foundation and will lock it in, causing stains and bacteria.</li>
            <li> The absolute best way to apply product on your face!</li>
            <li> These are a great tool, a must for me from now on.</li>
            <li> i like it very much, this is a very good one that i chose . and I will let my friends know</li>
            <li> This thing is perfection...&lt;br /&gt;and It it original... no tricks on this</li>
            <li> a definite must have! Great price and I will be repurchasing</li>
            <li> Perfect for a flawless and light foundation application. Worth the price?? It was a splurge for me...but I love the BB so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Pricy, but useful, just not as magical as I thought it would be &#x27;cause I can find make up sponge that can do the same job but with lower price. The cleanser is really good though. I use it to clean my brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the beauty blender it really works.</li>
            <li> I love the beauty blender and cleaner kit! Thought the deal was great but expected it to be the full size Beauty Blenders, not the minis. I am highly disappointed that in the description it DOES NOT tell you this will be the small blenders. I am unsure as to whether it was, indeed, a good deal and also, whether I want to keep this item. Thank you for the fast shipping and great care you took with shipping the product.</li>
            <li> I love love this sponge, I was very skeptical about the performance, but based on all the great reviews I decided to splurge and order it, and I am so glad I did, this not only makes my foundation look flawless but I also makes it last longer, the cleaner doesn&#x27;t clean as well as I expected but in overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally sold on this product. May never go back to brush application again! Why, because this sponge does not waste any makeup. And my hands aren&#x27;t getting dirty with every makeup application. It&#x27;s like an airbrush effect. I look so even.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that I can apply my concealer - still use a brush for that, but then use the sponge on top and what a natural blend. At first I tried it with Urban Decay&#x27;s NAKED SKIN liquid because the beauty supply had run out of my usual make up (Sue Devitt&#x27;s Whipped Foundation) and the makeup did not come off with the cleanser, but I also didn&#x27;t like that foundation as much so I switched back to Sue Devitt and now it&#x27;s like brand new after every wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my opinion is that if the foundation has any type of oil in it that the sponge will not cleanse and you don&#x27;t want that foundation on your face anyway. But back to this review; I was surprised that the cleanser was a good size bottle and you get two applicators, more for the $$.</li>
            <li> Love this product helps with blending and contouring foundation</li>
            <li> Great sponge..I think it&#x27;s better than using a brush..I think using the Beautyblender sponge you use less foundation than a brush</li>
            <li> I heard about these sponges over a year ago and have wanted to try them since.  The price held me back for a long time, but once I took the plunge I was so glad. They were totally worth it!  I love the flawless finish these sponges give.  I have used it both wet and dry and I think I prefer to wet the sponge first, but either way works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get the Beauty Blender, then you really have to get the blendercleanser.  It&#x27;s the best sponge cleaner that I have ever used and is totally worth it.  I use it almost every day and it seems like it will last for a long time.  I haven&#x27;t used very much at all and i&#x27;ve been using it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody posted on here how to get it clean, but I will reiterate it:  It doesn&#x27;t clean well well when the make up is still wet on the sponge right after you use it, so wait till it dries. Put the blendercleanser on a dry sponge (I clean it right before I need to use it again the next morning) and massage the cleanser in.  Then rinse with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best sponge and the best method for applying make-up I have ever found.</li>
            <li> THis is very worth the try and when you finally try, you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s very worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I thought it was any other makeup sponge but so many people rave about it that I wanted to see what the buzz was all about..&lt;br /&gt;Liquid foundation goes on BEAUTIFUULLY. OH MY GOSH. My best stippling foundation brush can&#x27;t compare. The application and wash was so much easier than a brush too. The set I bought came with two and if they ever need replacing (which I doubt for years) I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!!!!  This is unlike any sponge I&#x27;ve every used.  Flawless application.  I don&#x27;t care for the cleanser but the sponge is amazing!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE BEAUTY BLENDER! However the liquid cleansing soap is not as great as the bar soap. I recommend you buy it separately</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than a brush but I found it just ok. I saw some cheaper versions in Marshall&#x27;s and I was very disappointed. Not worth the money to me. They have cheaper ones on CVS and other stores.</li>
            <li> These have made my foundation routine so much easier. I like getting them wet first because the foundation goes on a lot smoother. These are great and you will absolutely love them. 100X better than a brush! My only problem is that one of them ripped a tiny bit in the first week I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this just for a few days, and its amazing! It distributes your foundation throughout your whole face in a nice even layer. Unlike the brush this does not leave your skin feeling so heavy. Even after 5 hours of wear I noticed around my nose and chin were I get really oily that it was very minimal to when I use to apply with a brush. Its truly awesome!</li>
            <li> I have been using the disposable white wedges for years. Luckily I happened to watch a beauty blogger on youtube and she talked about the beauty blender. I am so glad I ordered. By getting it wet first the makeup does not soak into the sponge. I was wasting so much makeup every day.  I bought store brands of this product to try. But I love the Beauty Blender so much I have not even opened the others. I have been using it for a month now. It did take a few tries before I figured out exactly how wet the sponge should be and how much makeup was needed. So don&#x27;t give up if the first few time you use it you find the finish is not what you want. Make sure you get the cleanser with it! You will need it to clean your sponge.</li>
            <li> This is the only way ill ever apply my make-up ever again! I perfect for my dry skin type. Dont make my liquid foundation look powdery, ect. I love this Beautyblender!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Perfect. Thank you</li>
            <li> Applies makeup perfectly.  Doesn&#x27;t clean that well - at least it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the brown color, but I am assuming it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> Amazing sponges blends so beautifully. Heard all the good things about it and glad I bought the blender and cleaner pack</li>
