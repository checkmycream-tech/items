            <li>The problem I had with it was having to relearn how to comb a pompadour with this product instead of using pomade, I lost an inch or so off the top of the pompadour but</li>
            <li>all-around feel texture was great.</li>
            <li>Best hair product I have used, I have been using it for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Healthy Corner Supply&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>

            <li>Got my hubby to try a new pomade, which is definitely in it&#x27;s own class!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good as new.</li>
            <li>We usually order two of the 4 oz jars but in the end that costs more than the 32 oz, so this time I ordered two jars one 32 oz and one 1 oz ( for traveling)  the look on his face when he opened the box was priceless.</li>
            <li>Will forever be my go to pomade, nothing I&#x27;ve tried works like the super hold!</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s water soluble gives it two special powers.</li>
            <li>Showed up at my door right away!</li>
            <li>Best to wipe forehead periodically if you are sweating from the hot sun, high humidity, light to heavy rain.</li>
            <li>A side note: it really does wash out unbelievably easy.</li>
            <li>The best pomade on the market for thick and wavy hair!</li>
            <li>It washes right out like gel.</li>
            <li>Ihave used layrite, love the way my hair stays,  the only problem I have doesn&#x27;t work well in humidity. ?.</li>

            <li> After using this miracle product that Mr. Hawley obvious signed a partnership deal with beezlebub himself  to create, I had the immediate need to play a stand up bass, get a neck tattoo, drink a can of PBR, ride a vintage bobber, buy a pair of levis, polish my Doc Martens, shave with a straight razor, pinstripe my Cadillac, Jump a shark on waterskis, change my name to Ponyboy, carry a switchblade, Listen to a Hank William album, roll my smokes up in my sleeve, cuff my jeans, visit Graceland, drag race in an empty quarry, fight in a rumble and date a girl named Pinky.</li>
            <li> You save money in the long run</li>
            <li> Having used EVERY brand (and I mean every) looking for something that would actually hold the entire day, I finally found this.</li>
            <li> Gets to soft,  but gets hard inside the building.</li>
            <li> The only negative is; for some reason after a few hours it almost seems like it attracts the dust in the air causing tiny white specs in my black hair, but applying a small amount of water makes it go away instantly.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my pomp down and neat all day or all night.</li>
            <li> I usually have to apply water a few times a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and its about 13 dollars for a small container.</li>
            <li> BTW I don&#x27;t think you can compare this to the nasty crap he was using called Black Magic.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and I have a few terrible calics.  </li>

            <li> Love this product, I get it for my husband all the time.</li>
            <li> Works great washes out only had a small problem with it. The problem I had with it was having to relearn how to comb a pompadour with this product instead of using pomade, I lost an inch or so off the top of the pompadour but all-around feel texture was great. Best part about this is it sets with cold air so if you comb your hair and drive with the air conditioner on it will set in about two minutes craziest thing I have ever seen!!!</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have used, I have been using it for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly/frizzy hair and this is the only product that allows me to achieve a &#x27;Don Draper&#x27; style look while still being easy to wash out</li>
            <li> Incredible pomade. Having used EVERY brand (and I mean every) looking for something that would actually hold the entire day, I finally found this. This product (when applied correctly) is the only one I&#x27;ve found that is capable to hold back my thick straight hair. If your looking for a hair product that actually works look no further. A side note: it really does wash out unbelievably easy.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I could find that does exactly as it claims: Holds like a wax, washes out like a gel.</li>
            <li> Ihave used layrite, love the way my hair stays,  the only problem I have doesn&#x27;t work well in humidity. ?. Gets to soft,  but gets hard inside the building.</li>
            <li> Ive been using Layrite for a couple years now to do my pomp on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;Buying a 32 oz. tub of it saves a ton of money and lasts me about 3-5 months.&lt;br /&gt;Holds like a wax, washes out like a gel. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Great product, and in great condition upon arrival</li>
            <li> The best pomade on the market for thick and wavy hair! It smooths out my waves to achieve the perfect pomp with ease. Will forever be my go to pomade, nothing I&#x27;ve tried works like the super hold!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and its about 13 dollars for a small container. You save money in the long run you just have to put all the money up front obviously.</li>
            <li> My teenage son would not think of leaving the house without having used this in his hair.  We usually order two of the 4 oz jars but in the end that costs more than the 32 oz, so this time I ordered two jars one 32 oz and one 1 oz ( for traveling)  the look on his face when he opened the box was priceless.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! Showed up at my door right away!</li>
            <li> The best pomade in existence.</li>
            <li> Got my hubby to try a new pomade, which is definitely in it&#x27;s own class! It washes out easily and leaves no residue and holds his hair with minimal amount of product. I will definitely have him purchase the bigger bottle so it lasts longer! BTW I don&#x27;t think you can compare this to the nasty crap he was using called Black Magic.</li>
            <li> Best hair product in the market hands down 5 stars love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff on Earth. It molds, it holds, and it stays put! The fact that it&#x27;s water soluble gives it two special powers. 1. It washes out very easily. 2. It is easily reactivated with a little water. It does lose it&#x27;s power rather quickly in the sun, but add a little water and run a comb through it and it&#x27;s good as new. The 32 oz size is on pace to last me well over a year, and I use it every day. Great value!</li>
            <li> Lay Rite Super Hold is an Awesome pomade !!! . My hair is thick and I have a few terrible calics.  This stuff keeps my pomp down and neat all day or all night. The best part is that its water soluble. It washes right out like gel. Now my pillow doesn&#x27;t look like someone left a burger on it !!! Just wish it was cheaper !!!  I definitely recommend this brand !!!</li>
            <li> Layrite Superhold Deluxe Pomade 32 oz&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Healthy Corner Supply&lt;br /&gt;Best price, fast shipping, great product.  Works best for me when applied with damp hair. Holds in place all day.  Does burn eyes a little when sweating from the hot sun.  Best to wipe forehead periodically if you are sweating from the hot sun, high humidity, light to heavy rain.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he loves the smell and hold of this pomade. I would definitely recommend the bigger container for sure.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd jar. Great value for the size. The Layrite comb is also a great product because of the tapered style teeth. Layrite knows pomade! Beware! Dangerously strong hold! Nothing else comes close.</li>
            <li> Good hair product and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I had the honor and privilege of getting my hair masterfully cut by the purveyor of this fine product, Mr. Donnie Hawley of Hawleywoods Barber shop. After using this miracle product that Mr. Hawley obvious signed a partnership deal with beezlebub himself  to create, I had the immediate need to play a stand up bass, get a neck tattoo, drink a can of PBR, ride a vintage bobber, buy a pair of levis, polish my Doc Martens, shave with a straight razor, pinstripe my Cadillac, Jump a shark on waterskis, change my name to Ponyboy, carry a switchblade, Listen to a Hank William album, roll my smokes up in my sleeve, cuff my jeans, visit Graceland, drag race in an empty quarry, fight in a rumble and date a girl named Pinky. My jar of Layrite has turned into my security blanket. I keep a jar at home, a jar at work, a jar in my Cadillac and a jar at my girlfriends house. If you find yourself fortunate enough to use this product, I guarantee that you will have a life changing experience. Thumbs up Mr. Hawley, thumbs up!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. It does the work.</li>
