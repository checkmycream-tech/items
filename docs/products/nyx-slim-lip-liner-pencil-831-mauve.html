            <li>and it looks super cute!</li>

            <li>Its a good color, its like your lips but better add some lips stick in a neutral color and a pinkish clear gloss</li>
            <li>Nice lip liner, the mauve color is pretty neutral.</li>
            <li>But this was great too, especially for the price</li>
            <li>Mauve is my new favorite lip color!  </li>
            <li>I love it for more natural looks.</li>
            <li>I like this color because it is a true mauve.</li>

            <li>I love this lip liner, it is so natural looking if you have pigmented lips already!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little lighter than I needed but a great liner</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My lips have a tendency to dry out with most products, but this is creamy, goes on smoothly, and lasts for some time.</li>
            <li>Or just the liner and the gloss is really pretty</li>
            <li>Really pretty</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>They offer an affordable option to higher end brands.</li>
            <li>I actually like this one better.</li>
            <li>I liked the Italian  brand a little more, and they were even cheaper.  </li>
            <li>priced!The color stays on a long time and I love the variety of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>More brown than expected but five stars otherwise.</li>
            <li>I apply the whole thing to my lips almost every day since I got it.</li>
            <li>The color is very rich and lasts through eating or drinking (carefully).</li>
            <li>Such a great color for a slight natural look.</li>
            <li>Frequently used as a dupe of higher priced name brands.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips.</li>
            <li>I use this more then my covergirl, sephora, wet n wild, and MAC liners.</li>
            <li>, i highly recommend this pencil</li>
            <li>Just like MAC Lip Whirl Liner for less! :)</li>

            <li>Goes on smooth and last surprisingly long for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the color but the liner is so dry and rough.</li>

            <li> Mauve is my new favorite lip color!  I apply the whole thing to my lips almost every day since I got it. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips.
