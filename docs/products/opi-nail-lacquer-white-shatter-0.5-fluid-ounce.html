    <ol>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t impressed at all.  </li>
            <li>It is very awesome.</li>
            <li>, she think it is very good!!</li>
            <li>I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s a good 8-10 dollars cheeper than buying it at the nail salons here in my hometown!! :D</li>
            <li>It sure isn&#x27;t shatter polish!!</li>
            <li>I did a multi colors bright pattern and then painted over with shatter and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>Use over a darker color first coat for best results.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them both!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I will keep trying it to see if I can find a good color combo, but so far, nothing looks that great with it.</li>
            <li>Love love love LOVE this polish!</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve been better off going into a retail store to buy it.</li>
            <li>I love OPI products - but their Shatter....</li>
            <li>I just have a couple tips for a better manicure  1.</li>
            <li>I will probably be buying this product in a darker color for a more polished look.</li>
            <li>The more polish on the brush the heavier on the crackle.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more when I need it.</li>
            <li>I used this on top of the OPI Spiderman color &#x27;</li>
            <li>Just love it on my nails.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>That is still going strong.</li>
            <li>OPI is a great nail polish in general.</li>
            <li>This stuff works JUST like the black shatter and looks GREAT!</li>
            <li>So I decided to go with an OPI because I&#x27;ve heard such great things...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using OPI for years, so I was excited to see they offered shatter polishes.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t dry that great either, so</li>
            <li>really cool though</li>
            <li>the white shatter is not AS good as it seems but definately not bad either.</li>
            <li>OPI is generally thought of as one of the best polish brands available, but the white &#x60;Shatter&#x27; looks like absolute trash!</li>
            <li>opi has the best shatter, however the white is a pinch translucent where you can see the color under the white part a pinch.  </li>
            <li>This one is a beauty - dries quick with lots of shatter and dies not smear.</li>
            <li>My Boyfriend Scales Walls&#x27; , if the shatter dries properly it looks really great on top of the white polish.</li>
            <li>I first bought the black shatter polish and LOVED IT!</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because it kind of cakes up after quite a long time and many, many uses.</li>
            <li>Fun to wear.  </li>
            <li>(not that us girls would mind going every week, right?</li>
            <li>on some of the colors it litterally does not stick to them and wipes right off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute, and since it&#x27;s white, it goes over 99% of my nail polishes!</li>
            <li>AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>I loved the black shatter so much over my bright and light colors that I was so excited to have the white for my dark colors.  </li>
            <li>Crackle is hard to find, this is great</li>
            <li>I first tried the silver crackle polish and fell in love with it, so I had to try the white!</li>
            <li>Thinner coats make smaller shatter effects and more \\&quot;broken\\&quot; looking pieces.</li>
            <li>But I love all the different looks you can get combining it with the shatter.</li>
            <li>and I love white for summer.</li>
            <li>, you need have bottom nail polish first, then it will work.</li>
            <li>that is EXACTLY what it looks like.</li>
            <li>I would say black is more for light colors or bright colors, but white is definitely flexible with some lighter, softer colors and bright or dark colors!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super fun to put over a bright neon color, or a deep dark color for a pop of contrast.</li>
            <li>Finish with a top coat of clear when dry to seal it and make it smooth so any ridges don&#x27;t snag on clothing, etc.</li>
            <li>I own a black shatter by Sinful Colors.</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>Haha)      </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really shatter</li>
            <li>I have a zillion other Crackle colors and for some reason, the white just isn&#x27;t as good as the others.</li>
            <li>Overall, definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Long lasting and adds a cool effect to your nails easily and without the need to go to a nail salon as often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase it again, I can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s worth the time you have to invest just to get your nails to look interesting.</li>
            <li>It completely picked up on the pink and turned itself into a light pink color of its own.</li>
            <li>Black shatter nail polish is great with light colors, but the white shatter nail polish is for the dark nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I am a big black and white fan so this is perfect to put over my black polish.</li>
            <li>My husband thought it looked like an 8 year old painted my nails for me....</li>
            <li>This polish is so see thru that I can see all the edges of the patterns underneath and it barely even shattered, mostly it looks like long streaky lines down my nail.</li>
            <li>if you do put a little too much on it just takes that much longer to set.</li>
            <li>After opening a brand new bottle it instantly got clumpy.</li>
            <li>So I thought a pastel pattern with a white shatter would give a more subtle springtime effect.</li>
            <li>Imagine painting a thin layer of white-out over your favorite color and then having it peel.</li>
            <li>but other than that really like it</li>
            <li>Always let the color under the shatter dry COMPLETELY before applying shatter.  </li>
            <li>The white seemed much thicker than the black that I have</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it does not shatter nearly as well as the black does, in fact it barely shatters at all, and</li>
            <li> The only problem is it goes on slightly clumpy, so you have to be really careful how much of it you apply.</li>
            <li> I have used a few other Shatters by different brands and have found that I prefer them over OPI, which is a first.</li>
            <li> I had a hot pink as the base then put the white over top.</li>
            <li> If you want to get it just be careful how you put it on and follow the tips I mentioned above.</li>
            <li> okay, I used it over the OPI Mad as a Hatter glitter polish.</li>
            <li> I purchased black and white shatter.</li>
            <li> I have both the white and  black shatter nail polish.</li>
            <li> I chose a hot pink color for the base and waited for it to dry completely, I then applied the white crackle and waited for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I think if it was watered down a bit it would dry nicer and apply easier.</li>
            <li> so I had a layer of pink then a layer of white with very little shatter.  </li>
            <li> The polish did not \\&quot;shatter\\&quot; as the other polishes I have purchased from the OPI line did.</li>
            <li> So I went on line to see what other colors there were.  </li>
            <li> it makes me scared to try any of the other colors besides the black.</li>
            <li> try to just do a couple swipes over your dark color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i believe the shipper sent me some water down polish&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cap was on tight.</li>
            <li> But this white shatter is SUCH a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> Thicker gives less broken pieces.     </li>
            <li> Seriously-</li>
            <li> I wish I had known this before I spent 11 dollars on it in the store because I hate it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the OPI White Shatter nail polish.</li>
            <li> Can someone tell me what went wrong with this company??</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Easier to use when the base color is set for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried applying it very lightly, heavily, vertically, horizontally; you name it: it always came out looking like crap.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!</li>
            <li> It even has a sickening smell.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> simply awful!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in these bottles that I received, but it is not shatter polish. I purchased black and white shatter. Both polished on like white out. The result was not even close to how it was supposed to be. I have had crakle and shatter polish done before, so I know how it should look. I wasted my money on this. I would&#x27;ve been better off going into a retail store to buy it. Can someone tell me what went wrong with this company?? What is in these bottles that I have?? It sure isn&#x27;t shatter polish!!</li>
            <li> I first tried the silver crackle polish and fell in love with it, so I had to try the white! I chose a hot pink color for the base and waited for it to dry completely, I then applied the white crackle and waited for it to dry. It completely picked up on the pink and turned itself into a light pink color of its own. My finger nails looked like Valentine&#x27;s Day colors! Needless to say, it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. I will keep trying it to see if I can find a good color combo, but so far, nothing looks that great with it.</li>
            <li> Use over a darker color first coat for best results. Don&#x27;t over think this. You don&#x27;t want to keep going over the same nail again and again or the whole thing will be just plain white. try to just do a couple swipes over your dark color. and then wait for it to &amp;#34;develop&amp;#34;. Finish with a top coat of clear when dry to seal it and make it smooth so any ridges don&#x27;t snag on clothing, etc.</li>
            <li> I own a black shatter by Sinful Colors. They were out of the white or I would have bought it. I did a multi colors bright pattern and then painted over with shatter and LOVED it. So I thought a pastel pattern with a white shatter would give a more subtle springtime effect. So I decided to go with an OPI because I&#x27;ve heard such great things... WRONG!! This polish is so see thru that I can see all the edges of the patterns underneath and it barely even shattered, mostly it looks like long streaky lines down my nail. So disappointed. Never buying shatter from OPI again. Guess I should have saved my money and waited for the Sinful Colors version.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the OPI White Shatter nail polish. The polish did not \\&quot;shatter\\&quot; as the other polishes I have purchased from the OPI line did. It just created a one line streak for some reason. I&#x27;m not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> I love OPI products - but their Shatter.... not so much. The nail polish is clumpy and doesn&#x27;t give you the desired effect. I think if it was watered down a bit it would dry nicer and apply easier. I have used a few other Shatters by different brands and have found that I prefer them over OPI, which is a first.</li>
            <li> After opening a brand new bottle it instantly got clumpy. It feels and looks like white out. My husband thought it looked like an 8 year old painted my nails for me.... simply awful!</li>
            <li> the white shatter is not AS good as it seems but definately not bad either. I just have a couple tips for a better manicure  1. Always put a color under the shatter.  2. Always let the color under the shatter dry COMPLETELY before applying shatter.  3. You might consider putting your shatter in the fridge for about five minutes before using to reduce clumpiness.  4. Shake well before using.  5. Thinner coats make smaller shatter effects and more \\&quot;broken\\&quot; looking pieces. Thicker gives less broken pieces.     I&#x27;d also like to mention that I did not try Mia, Sally Hansen, China Glaze etc. crackle products, only opi white shatter. If you want to get it just be careful how you put it on and follow the tips I mentioned above.</li>
            <li> OPI is a great nail polish in general. But I love all the different looks you can get combining it with the shatter. And combed with OPI topcoat, it stays on forever!</li>
            <li> Black shatter nail polish is great with light colors, but the white shatter nail polish is for the dark nail polish.  This stuff works JUST like the black shatter and looks GREAT!</li>
            <li> THE SHATTER CRAZE HAS HIT ME LIKE A TORNADO!! I am obsessed with this and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. Thank GOD Amazon was here for me to fill my SHATTER craving!</li>
            <li> this polish cam awhile ago i know but i was had on this&lt;br /&gt;it never worked from day one and to tell the truth i don&#x27;t believe it was OPI&lt;br /&gt;i believe the shipper sent me some water down polish&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> I have a zillion other Crackle colors and for some reason, the white just isn&#x27;t as good as the others. Maybe it&#x27;s just me?</li>
            <li> It shattered okay, I used it over the OPI Mad as a Hatter glitter polish. I will probably be buying this product in a darker color for a more polished look.</li>
            <li> opi has the best shatter, however the white is a pinch translucent where you can see the color under the white part a pinch.  really cool though</li>
            <li> Crackle is hard to find, this is great and I love white for summer.</li>
            <li> I have both the white and  black shatter nail polish. I absolutely love them both! I would say black is more for light colors or bright colors, but white is definitely flexible with some lighter, softer colors and bright or dark colors! Long lasting and adds a cool effect to your nails easily and without the need to go to a nail salon as often. (not that us girls would mind going every week, right? Haha)      The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because it kind of cakes up after quite a long time and many, many uses. Nothing that would keep me from buying again, though.    Overall, definitely worth a try! And you get quite a bit of product for the price too!</li>
            <li> I loved the black shatter so much over my bright and light colors that I was so excited to have the white for my dark colors.  But this white shatter is SUCH a disappointment. it does not shatter nearly as well as the black does, in fact it barely shatters at all, and on some of the colors it litterally does not stick to them and wipes right off. I wish I had known this before I spent 11 dollars on it in the store because I hate it. it makes me scared to try any of the other colors besides the black.</li>
            <li> Fun to wear.  The more polish on the brush the heavier on the crackle.  Easier to use when the base color is set for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I first bought the black shatter polish and LOVED IT! So I went on line to see what other colors there were.  Of course I wanted to try the white. I had a hot pink as the base then put the white over top. The white seemed much thicker than the black that I have and it didn&#x27;t really shatter so I had a layer of pink then a layer of white with very little shatter.  Wasn&#x27;t impressed at all.  [[ASIN:B004ZT0CQO OPI Nail Lacquer, White Shatter, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using OPI for years, so I was excited to see they offered shatter polishes. This one is a beauty - dries quick with lots of shatter and dies not smear. I love it!</li>
            <li> It is very awesome. I give it to my friends, she think it is very good!! And I try it as well, you need have bottom nail polish first, then it will work.</li>
            <li> I bought the White Shatter in 2012. The polish is now hardened in the bottle. The cap was on tight. I bought this because it was OPI. I had also bought and inexpensive brand at the grocery store about the same time. That is still going strong. I guess it is not all about the name. Will not buy OPI Shatter again.</li>
            <li> OPI is generally thought of as one of the best polish brands available, but the white &#x60;Shatter&#x27; looks like absolute trash! It looks like peeling  white-out. Seriously- that is EXACTLY what it looks like. Imagine painting a thin layer of white-out over your favorite color and then having it peel. It even has a sickening smell.&lt;br /&gt; I tried applying it very lightly, heavily, vertically, horizontally; you name it: it always came out looking like crap.</li>
            <li> I am a big black and white fan so this is perfect to put over my black polish. I will buy more when I need it.</li>
            <li> I used this on top of the OPI Spiderman color &#x27;My Boyfriend Scales Walls&#x27; , if the shatter dries properly it looks really great on top of the white polish. The only problem is it goes on slightly clumpy, so you have to be really careful how much of it you apply. And it doesn&#x27;t dry that great either, so if you do put a little too much on it just takes that much longer to set. I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase it again, I can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s worth the time you have to invest just to get your nails to look interesting.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STUFF, REACH BEFORE I WAS EXPECTING, GOOD PRICE AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> I like white shatter. I had a while for the product do to package damage. but other than that really like it</li>
            <li> I bought this one for the holidays to use over my red opi polish. Just love it on my nails.</li>
            <li> Love love love LOVE this polish! :) It&#x27;s super cute, and since it&#x27;s white, it goes over 99% of my nail polishes! It&#x27;s super fun to put over a bright neon color, or a deep dark color for a pop of contrast. I would soo buy this again! PLUS; it&#x27;s a good 8-10 dollars cheeper than buying it at the nail salons here in my hometown!! :D Yay for saving money! &amp;lt;3</li>
