    <ol>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>Works GREAT!</li>
            <li>A lot of hair products irritate my scalp, not had an issue with this one and for my hair style it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Perfect for shorter , thinner hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>The product is one of the best.</li>
            <li>great stuff!  </li>
            <li>This is the best stuff there is.</li>
            <li>Keeps me looking fly.</li>
            <li>Otherwise happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have used many products, but this works the best as I like a mat finish.  </li>
            <li>What I like is that it isn&#x27;t greasy or waxy, while still having good hold.</li>
            <li>and it has a nice, matte look to it when on your hair.</li>
            <li>Very strong hold.</li>
            <li>Best product for me so far.  </li>
            <li>but this may not be an issue for others as I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is  a nice smooth consistency and gives all day hold.</li>
            <li>Love it, need Jay Fata to keep representing this product</li>
            <li>The best of all of the above options.  </li>
            <li>One thing to note is that this product does provide more of a \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; hold rather than a \\&quot;soft\\</li>
            <li>, the better it looks as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>Love this hair stuff.</li>
            <li>Its more of a clay thickness than a putty.  </li>
            <li>easy is it to work into the hair?  </li>
            <li>Easy.  </li>
            <li>it wash out easily?  </li>
            <li>It also washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>but each have a unique set of pros and cons.  </li>
            <li>Most people, however, should still be able to get it out in a single wash.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I later purchased a container full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t know if my hair style or hair type is the right one for this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of hair products and couldn&#x27;t ever seem to find the right one for me.</li>
            <li>Eufora Hero Texture Putty is the best I&#x27;ve used so far (and I&#x27;m on my 4th round)!</li>
            <li>Unlike most hair products where &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; this is quite the opposite.</li>
            <li>the hold consistent?</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a top contender.  </li>
            <li>I actually feel like the more I run my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li>keep my hair short on the sides and a bit longer on top.  </li>
            <li>and I use this product to stop the pokey / fuzzy parts while giving me total of my longer hair up top.</li>
            <li>One of the few hair waxes/puttys that does not use petroleum Jelly (PETROLATUM) or mineral oil--which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Holds better and much lighter than American Crew Fiber,</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a nice natural finish but at the same time give me the control I need to adjust it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>You can layer it for EXTRA strong hold</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than the other products and spreads very easily and evenly into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Great matte finish and actually makes your hair look a little thicker.  </li>
            <li>Goes on light, does leave your hands extra sticky.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use too much for it to work well</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have much smell at all.  </li>
            <li>It has a MUCH stronger hold than Fiber too (bonus NOT greasy or waxy feeling).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an interesting feeling that I haven&#x27;t gotten from any other brand</li>
            <li>much do you need to get a decent hold?  </li>
            <li>However it is well worth it because you have to use barely any of it.</li>
            <li>With the right amount of product, your hair will stay \\&quot;locked\\&quot; for an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If anything, there are a small amount of floral notes but I don&#x27;t think most people will notice.  </li>
            <li>Just little dabs at the tip of a couple fingers is more than enough.</li>
            <li>natural does the hair feel throughout the day?  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Somewhat\\&quot; natural.  </li>
            <li>This particular product should last for 12+ hours before you see any loss in hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because the hold is so strong, you get a little bit of crunchiness (even with a tiny amount of product).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with the following hair type / style:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it dries my hair slightly more than the aforementioned products</li>
            <li>This is the only hair product you can NEVER &amp;#34;over use.&amp;#34;  Only complaint is that they could use a more upscale looking jar.  </li>
            <li>With the smallest amount (relative to the other products), I can get a longer and firmer hold than pretty much any other product.  </li>
            <li>Although it costs a little more than some other products on the market, it lasts long and you can tell the difference in quality.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that this product is a few dollars more than the others; however, it&#x27;s a wash as you will use less of this product per application.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Please see my other reviews to compare against all of the above products.  </li>
            <li> (Seriously, you can never use too much of this product).  </li>
            <li> It has a very dry feel to it.</li>
            <li> Crunching is minimal and there is a minimal amount of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feel compare to the amount of hold you get.  </li>
            <li> Not much.  </li>
            <li> Not too waxy, not too heavy, not too thin and sliplpery, JUST RIGHT.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I usually use american crew fiber wax.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other products, this product has a marshmallow creme-ish texture to it.  </li>
            <li> A while back they gave me a small sample to take home to try.</li>
            <li> Although other brands were supposed to be matte, they always ended up being crispy or made my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> Although my last purchase had some little clumps of it dried in the container a bit anoying for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Have long thick wavy dark hair.  </li>
            <li> my previous product of choice.</li>
            <li> &quot; hold that you might get from a slightly weaker product, like Fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you need the strongest hold and don&#x27;t mind a little bit of elbow grease in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> I go for the messy look</li>
            <li> (it is sort of like REALLY fluffy marshmallow ).  </li>
            <li> Small chunky separation.</li>
            <li> Over the past year, I have been in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair creme/wax which provides the highest hold and a matte look.  </li>
            <li> the evenings when we want to go out to dinner or somewhere and my hair sticks up or doesn&#x27;t do what it should, or just any bad-hair-day, applying a small dab on my hair takes care of it.</li>
            <li> A bit hard to work with and</li>
            <li> My hair is 1-2 inches, extremely thick</li>
            <li> The ladies at the place I get a haircut apply a very small dab of this afterwards.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still difficult to wash out.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad and goes away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst (like Molding Clay or GrungeMat)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome. It is  a nice smooth consistency and gives all day hold.</li>
            <li> Best product for me so far.  Have long thick wavy dark hair.  Product holds well almost all day and even prevents my hair from reforming waves.  Crunching is minimal and there is a minimal amount of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feel compare to the amount of hold you get.  Goes on light, does leave your hands extra sticky.  Holds better and much lighter than American Crew Fiber, my previous product of choice.</li>
            <li> didnt hold, too crunchy.</li>
            <li> I usually use american crew fiber wax. I came on amazon hoping to find something cheaper.. and ended up with this even more expensive brand. However it is well worth it because you have to use barely any of it. Just little dabs at the tip of a couple fingers is more than enough. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and after a couple of hours my hair stays in place and you can&#x27;t feel that there is anything on it. However at the beginning the hair does feel like it&#x27;s got a layer of wax all over it. It&#x27;s an interesting feeling that I haven&#x27;t gotten from any other brand but it&#x27;s not that bad and goes away.</li>
            <li> I have tried all hair products to hold my short pixie hair cut with all the texture and mussed-up stuff. Works GREAT! Not too waxy, not too heavy, not too thin and sliplpery, JUST RIGHT. MY 5th jar</li>
            <li> Keeps me looking fly.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a solid product especially when compared to Sumotech and American Crew Fiber. You don&#x27;t need to use too much for it to work well and it has a nice, matte look to it when on your hair. My only complaint is that it dries my hair slightly more than the aforementioned products but this may not be an issue for others as I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, need Jay Fata to keep representing this product</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve found this product it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used.  A lot of hair products irritate my scalp, not had an issue with this one and for my hair style it is perfect. Small chunky separation. A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A bit hard to work with and a lil does NOT go a long way. Unlike most hair products where &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; this is quite the opposite. Although I don&#x27;t know if my hair style or hair type is the right one for this product. It doesn&#x27;t provide the effect I was expecting.</li>
            <li> My hair is 1-2 inches, extremely thick and I prefer the spiky look.  Over the past year, I have been in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair creme/wax which provides the highest hold and a matte look.  In short, there are lots of options that function very differently.  To date, I have tried American Crew Fiber, D:fi D:sculpt, TIGI matte separation, Moving Rubber Spiky Edge, Moving Rubber Grunge Mat, Jonathan Dirt, Sticky Rice, TRENDStarter matte finishing wax and Eufora Hero.  All of these options are priced in the same range (per oz) but each have a unique set of pros and cons.  I&#x27;m still searching for the silver bullet (for my hair type and style).  For Eufora Hero, here&#x27;s the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the \\&quot;actual\\&quot; hold like?  The best of all of the above options.  With the right amount of product, your hair will stay \\&quot;locked\\&quot; for an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How easy is it to work into the hair?  Easy.  Unlike the other products, this product has a marshmallow creme-ish texture to it.  It&#x27;s much lighter than the other products and spreads very easily and evenly into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How natural does the hair feel throughout the day?  \\&quot;Somewhat\\&quot; natural.  Because the hold is so strong, you get a little bit of crunchiness (even with a tiny amount of product).  However, if you need the strongest of holds, this product should be your go-to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the hold consistent? Yes.  This particular product should last for 12+ hours before you see any loss in hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much do you need to get a decent hold?  Not much.  These guys have perfected their product in the \\&quot;hold\\&quot; category.  With the smallest amount (relative to the other products), I can get a longer and firmer hold than pretty much any other product.  One thing to note is that this product does provide more of a \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; hold rather than a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; hold that you might get from a slightly weaker product, like Fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it wash out easily?  No.  It&#x27;s not the worst (like Molding Clay or GrungeMat) but it&#x27;s still difficult to wash out.  Most people, however, should still be able to get it out in a single wash.  This, no doubt, is a tradeoff you must accept on account of the hold strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it smell? This product doesn&#x27;t have much smell at all.  If anything, there are a small amount of floral notes but I don&#x27;t think most people will notice.  If you are anti-smell, this should definitely be your go-to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see my other reviews to compare against all of the above products.  Overall, this is a top contender.  If you need the strongest hold and don&#x27;t mind a little bit of elbow grease in the shower.  Personally, this product and Grunge Mat are my two go-tos.  The only downside is that this product is a few dollars more than the others; however, it&#x27;s a wash as you will use less of this product per application.</li>
            <li> The ladies at the place I get a haircut apply a very small dab of this afterwards. A while back they gave me a small sample to take home to try. I liked it so much I later purchased a container full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evenings when we want to go out to dinner or somewhere and my hair sticks up or doesn&#x27;t do what it should, or just any bad-hair-day, applying a small dab on my hair takes care of it. What I like is that it isn&#x27;t greasy or waxy, while still having good hold.</li>
            <li> This product is used where I get my hair cut..  I have used many products, but this works the best as I like a mat finish.  It also washes out easily.  Although it costs a little more than some other products on the market, it lasts long and you can tell the difference in quality.  You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Great matte finish and actually makes your hair look a little thicker.  Do not need to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> My friend had this product and I gave it a shot. I&#x27;ll never go back. Perfect for shorter , thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of hair products and couldn&#x27;t ever seem to find the right one for me. Although other brands were supposed to be matte, they always ended up being crispy or made my hair look greasy. Eufora Hero Texture Putty is the best I&#x27;ve used so far (and I&#x27;m on my 4th round)! It gives my hair a nice natural finish but at the same time give me the control I need to adjust it throughout the day. I actually feel like the more I run my fingers through my hair, the better it looks as the day goes on. I highly recommend this product to anyone with the following hair type / style:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type:&lt;br /&gt;Straight and flat when long and pokey / fuzzy when short&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair style with this product:&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair short on the sides and a bit longer on top.  I go for the messy look and I use this product to stop the pokey / fuzzy parts while giving me total of my longer hair up top.</li>
            <li> Love this hair stuff. Although my last purchase had some little clumps of it dried in the container a bit anoying for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> This putty works great and even though it feels stiff on your hair is is nearly impossible to see. You will like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Holds hair in place without shine or that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Okay...this is A- MAZ--ZING STUFF! It&#x27;s sort of like American crew fiber but it&#x27;s a bit creamier and easier to use (it is sort of like REALLY fluffy marshmallow ).  It has a MUCH stronger hold than Fiber too (bonus NOT greasy or waxy feeling).  You can layer it for EXTRA strong hold and it never looks greasy (Seriously, you can never use too much of this product).  It has a very dry feel to it. This is the only hair product you can NEVER &amp;#34;over use.&amp;#34;  Only complaint is that they could use a more upscale looking jar.  The product is one of the best. And, I&#x27;ve used $60 waxes/puttys and this putty is strongest!&lt;br /&gt;REALLY great stuff!  One of the few hair waxes/puttys that does not use petroleum Jelly (PETROLATUM) or mineral oil--which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Very strong hold. Its more of a clay thickness than a putty.  Otherwise happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff there is. It is a little pricey but this brand is ultra concentrated so you don&#x27;t have to use near as much as other similar products. This is definitely one of those situations where you are going to get what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
