            <li>EXCELLENT moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>great product!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell that great while putting it on, but we can&#x27;t have it all now can we?</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Also love their everything balm!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This Rosehip Oil is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I apply once in the morning 3 drops to weledas rose cream and massage in after I&#x27;ve showered and then just the 3 drops of the rosehip oil before bedtime.</li>
            <li>Liked the moisturizing without the greasiness even though I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product amazing results :)</li>
            <li>but this one works magic; hydration without clogging pores.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I have been using more than a year</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of skin oils and have tried many.</li>
            <li>need more than a drop to cover you face lightly with this oil.</li>
            <li>I am so glad they are now available in the States.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, honestly I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li>:) love this product and love the new glow.</li>
            <li>It absorbs wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or clogging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy and feels light on my face.</li>
            <li>Still, I like it and it makes my face feel so good and soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to work over night, but I didn&#x27;t find very much improvement even over many weeks - and I did see some milia on my cheekbones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice as oils go, with a good moisturizing-yet-dry-to-the-touch consistency (I hate when oils make me feel greasy) and a pleasant neutral smell.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff so much</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>During winter when my skin is really dry, I use it on its  own.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit I have been freaking out about fine lines and clear skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best beauty product and beauty secret ever made!</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth, but the Olay products do that as well</li>
            <li>First time ever using oil</li>
            <li>On top of that my daughter was wowed by how much its changed my facial skin</li>
            <li>I am becoming a big fan of trilogy products.  </li>
            <li>but this product has been extremely complimentary to my new anti aging regimen.</li>
            <li>My skin is already relatively &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m still pretty young so, this is more preventative than reparative.</li>
            <li>It is very healing for the skin.</li>
            <li>You will see the renewing and restoring effect  more than any other fancy serums or creams.</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and for the first time in my life have received compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love it, I feel like the wrinkles are less pronounced.</li>
            <li>and I notice the ruddy red complexion has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>High praise.</li>
            <li>The products are natural, high quality, and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>The dropper is very nice and the glass bottle has survived a few drops due to clumsiness on my part.</li>
            <li>I have very oily  but sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I first learned about Trilogy when when my sister in New Zealand gave me several products.  </li>
            <li>İts all natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for natural replacements for my non-organic anti-aging products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t completely gone, but I have only been using it for about a month.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m looking for natural replacements for my non-organic anti-aging products. I was hopeful that this could be a compelling option, but alas. It&#x27;s very nice as oils go, with a good moisturizing-yet-dry-to-the-touch consistency (I hate when oils make me feel greasy) and a pleasant neutral smell. The dropper is very nice and the glass bottle has survived a few drops due to clumsiness on my part. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work over night, but I didn&#x27;t find very much improvement even over many weeks - and I did see some milia on my cheekbones. So, now I just use it as a body oil or as an eye makeup remover to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell.  Could not use product.  Threw it out. complete waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great! I have an oily skin and was afraid to use oil but this one works magic; hydration without clogging pores.</li>
            <li> I use this oil every night after cleansing and toning. I have dry skin and I find this product wonderfully nourishing. In cold weather I use it in day time too along with my normal day cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for years and bought it on Amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it in the USA.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I have two autoimmune diseases that cause a red facial rash and blotchiness. I&#x27;ve tried various over the counter creams for the red rashes and to no avail they don&#x27;t touch it. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now and I notice the ruddy red complexion has improved tremendously. On top of that my daughter was wowed by how much its changed my facial skin :) love this product and love the new glow. I apply once in the morning 3 drops to weledas rose cream and massage in after I&#x27;ve showered and then just the 3 drops of the rosehip oil before bedtime. Amazing product amazing results :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of skin oils and have tried many. This is by far my favorite. It moisturizes my skin and get this- makes it less oily! It doesn&#x27;t smell that great while putting it on, but we can&#x27;t have it all now can we?</li>
            <li> This Rosehip Oil is amazing.  I have a really bad scar on the bridge of my nose from Mohs surgery and this is the only thing that has lightened and smoothed out the scar.  It isn&#x27;t completely gone, but I have only been using it for about a month.  So my hopes is that the scar will be a thing of the past.  It is a bit oily so if you wear it under make-up you need just a drop.  This product will not disappoint!!</li>
            <li> One if the best oils I have found!! Use it daily!!</li>
            <li> This is the best beauty product and beauty secret ever made! It hydrates and erases the lines and wrinkles. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews for this is the Australian press. They sing it&#x27;s praises, but frankly you can use other things. I just figured I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;You need more than a drop to cover you face lightly with this oil. Try 1 drop for forehead and 1 for each cheek and neck. It goes on well and can be used under a serum and cream. I do not put it on my chin as I tend to break out there. I use the Oil morning and night with Olay Regenerist serum and Day/Night cream respectively. My skin is soft and smooth, but the Olay products do that as well and I swear by Olay. Have been using their products for 30+ years.&lt;br /&gt;They say models use it but they have 15-22 year-old skin. Not exactly in need of extra care.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT moisturizer!  I have very oily  but sensitive skin so I use this as my moisturizer at night.  It absorbs wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or clogging. I had no reaction to this at all. I am becoming a big fan of trilogy products.  Also love their everything balm!</li>
            <li> Love love love. I use this every night. Makes my dry skin glow in the morning. Love this stuff so much</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it on my face every night and every morning. I have bad acne, and since I started using this my skin looks and feels so much healthier!</li>
            <li> I first learned about Trilogy when when my sister in New Zealand gave me several products.  I have been using the oil faithfully for several years now, a couple of drops mixed into my day and night creams. During winter when my skin is really dry, I use it on its  own.  It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  I am 65 years old and for the first time in my life have received compliments on my skin.  My much younger sister swears the oil got rid of lip wrinkles. The products are natural, high quality, and reasonably priced.  I am so glad they are now available in the States.  A few years ago, the toney department store Harrod&#x27;s in London featured the Trilogy line.  High praise.</li>
            <li> I think the products works well on my skin.  I did not give it 5 stars because it is oily.  I may look for another product for the summer months.</li>
            <li> bottle was broken. completely empty. glass everywhere.</li>
            <li> Reshape oil works as described!  Liked the moisturizing without the greasiness even though I have oily skin.  It is very healing for the skin. Would recommend this product.  It did take a few weeks to see the effects.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s not too greasy and feels light on my face.</li>
            <li> Love it, I feel like the wrinkles are less pronounced. First time ever using oil</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on a Pinterest recommendation. I have to admit I have been freaking out about fine lines and clear skin. In only one week I&#x27;ve seen a change even on the texture of my skin. I have been doing a lot of at home DIY masks but this product has been extremely complimentary to my new anti aging regimen. The product was well wrapped and arrived on time. I will definitely order from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Can not get enough of this product....would recommend it to anyone male and female as it is does not make your face shiny or greasy.</li>
            <li> great product!!! It gives everything in just 2-3 drops.I have been using more than a year and i am addicted already.You will see the renewing and restoring effect  more than any other fancy serums or creams.İts all natural!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I can tell the difference in my skin already--it glows! I will order it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, honestly I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference. My skin is already relatively &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m still pretty young so, this is more preventative than reparative. Still, I like it and it makes my face feel so good and soft.</li>
