    <ol>
            <li>and I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li>I think it is the best product of its type for the money.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>PERFECT !!!!!</li>
            <li>it is sooo much better!!!</li>
            <li>They used to make a flexible model that worked great for years.</li>
            <li>Seems like it works great, just doesn&#x27;t hold up for us.</li>
            <li>This has been in use now for many months, and no complaints at all!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this a 2 because there are some good points.</li>
            <li>We bought this and he loved it.</li>
            <li>all it is a great design and does not fog, but there are too many design flaws in it for me to recommend it.</li>
            <li>My husband has had many shower mirrors and wasn&#x27;t really happy with any of them.</li>
            <li>this is amazing....</li>
            <li>This may be a great fog free mirror.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product, but would be better if it would extend.</li>
            <li>Does not fog up and installs easily !</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this mirror for the really low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, I turn the shut off valve off to shave making most of the water and pressure to go to the mirror.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if it drained out the bottom.</li>
            <li>Nobel prize winning product...</li>
            <li>rip-off....piece of junk....would cost us more to return</li>
            <li>Having said that, the mirror surface of my unit became encrusted with minerals and was easily scratched during cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It easily connected watertight to my shower head pipe.</li>
            <li>i used to have a Sharper Image one on a flexible plastic link mount, and it could easily be moved to any location and stay there.  </li>
            <li>the attachment doesnt fit some shower heads, but its easy to unscrew and use as a hand held mirror</li>
            <li>The fog-free part works fine.</li>
            <li>and then the shower head easily fit onto the shut off valve.  </li>
            <li>Had a big name brand previously but have found this to be a much better value and have been using it happily ever since!!!  </li>
            <li>These issues I could have live with because I was able to fix them.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>might work fine if you have a shower head with a very deep fitting.</li>
            <li>it is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost of the product.</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>Very crappy quality!</li>
            <li>The water wasn&#x27;t extremely hot, so I don&#x27;t know what happened.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>The first unit I have lasted 8 months before breaking.  </li>
            <li>The replacement unit I got broke on the first use.  </li>
            <li>advice, find a better product from a different company.</li>
            <li>He installed it and the first time he used it, the mirror shattered.</li>
            <li>My shower pipe is real high</li>
            <li>Maybe the company should go back to the older better model.</li>
            <li>My shower head is very high, so</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t really want to dismantle my shower to install the mirror, it was a different diameter and wouldn&#x27;t even fit.  </li>
            <li>WHILE THE WATER IS FLOWING THROUGH IT, IS TOO MUCH FOR THE THREADED SCREW.</li>
            <li>Just too much</li>
            <li>This mirror performs as stated...even better than expected.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is only fog free if it is plumbed in.</li>
            <li>They spray a fairly strong stream of water that can get outside the shower if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>Mirror and general concept is good but the plastic threads are weak and leaks after using teflon tape.</li>
            <li>The other reviews about the threads not working and leading are true as well.  </li>
            <li>It is not as flexible as some but with the way it keeps the fog off and how clear is stays</li>
            <li>Another issue I fixed was the angle of the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I fixed this problem by using picture hanging wire.  </li>
            <li>So, unless you hang the mirror directly below your shower head, it will sag.  </li>
            <li>Both of mine leaked from the top edge allowing water to run down the center of the mirror blocking my view.  </li>
            <li>If you do get this mirror, I would drill out the top hole on the back of the mirror making it a little bigger.  </li>
            <li>I have had five or more in the shower mirrors and this uses the least amount of water and keeps the mirror the cleanest of any that I have had!  </li>
            <li>Most of the bad reviews are true.  </li>
            <li>After three days it developed a crack and started to leak, then finally broke.</li>
            <li>Problem is that no modern shower head has enough threads to really engage well.  </li>
            <li>THEN, WHEN I REALLY BEARED DOWN ON IT, THE TIGHTENER CRACKED.</li>
            <li>The water used to eliminate fog tended to flow straight down the middle of the mirror after 6 or 7 years.  </li>
            <li>First, the joint where the mirror attaches to the water tube is not strong enough to support the weight of the mirror.  </li>

            <li> Over time the mirror will hang straight down making it hard to see in.  </li>

            <li> You end up stripping one or the other out.  </li>
            <li> The connection is so flimsy to the mirror that when it fills with water the mirror flops down and forward.</li>
            <li> so I needed to angle the mirror down to see in it.  </li>
            <li> And just so you know, there are five very small holes on the back of the mirror used for pressure relief and they spray the water</li>
            <li> Mirror cracked in half today, with water streaming out the bottom half of the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I was just standing there, heard a snap, and the mirror was cracked in half.      </li>
            <li> AND, NO MATTER HOW TIGHT I TIGHTENED THE TIGHTENER</li>
            <li> quality and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I could have lived with all the above issues, but the one issue I could not get over was the mirror is too thin and breaks.  </li>
            <li> Cracked after a few months.</li>
            <li> I think the holes are too small.  </li>
            <li> , THE MIRROR CONTINUED TO SLOWLY FALL.</li>
            <li> Wanted to buy a less expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> the item is shody, impossible to adjust to existing shower head, it fogs up immediately and spews water out of jets in the back of the mirror....</li>
            <li> This is one of the WORSE purchases I have ever made on Amazon...</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting off about 1/4\\&quot; of threads</li>
            <li> Needless to say you get what you pay for because this mirror is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and their idiotic response was that it is being used in the shower and will of course get water on it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this mirror because of all the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> awful,awful, awful product ....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very crappy quality! Shot water out all over!!</li>
            <li> I have had five or more in the shower mirrors and this uses the least amount of water and keeps the mirror the cleanest of any that I have had!  It is not as flexible as some but with the way it keeps the fog off and how clear is stays it is by far my favorite.  I read the other review and was hesitant to buy but it has been two months and mine is still working!  I am very happy with this mirror for the really low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 09/25/2012&lt;br /&gt;This is still working and I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Mirror cracked in half today, with water streaming out the bottom half of the mirror.  This happened after 3 weeks of using it.  The water wasn&#x27;t extremely hot, so I don&#x27;t know what happened.  I was just standing there, heard a snap, and the mirror was cracked in half.      I don&#x27;t recommend this product, and would not buy another one.</li>
            <li> My last Zadro finally broke last week while I was removing it from its fourth shower in 12 years.  I think it is the best product of its type for the money.  The alternative is a stainless steel version that costs a little over $70.  Having said that, the mirror surface of my unit became encrusted with minerals and was easily scratched during cleaning.  The water used to eliminate fog tended to flow straight down the middle of the mirror after 6 or 7 years.  I made do until last week.  Time to start another decade of shower shaving.</li>
            <li> This unit installs between your shower head and outlet pipe.  After three days it developed a crack and started to leak, then finally broke.</li>
            <li> I always bought my shower mirrors in Sharper image. When it went belly up I bought this one and it is sooo much better!!!</li>
            <li> I PLACED THE MIRROR IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION (AS I AM TALL) AND, NO MATTER HOW TIGHT I TIGHTENED THE TIGHTENER, THE MIRROR CONTINUED TO SLOWLY FALL. THEN, WHEN I REALLY BEARED DOWN ON IT, THE TIGHTENER CRACKED. SO, IT SEEMES THE WEIGHT OF THE MIRROR, WHILE THE WATER IS FLOWING THROUGH IT, IS TOO MUCH FOR THE THREADED SCREW.</li>
            <li> During installation, noted that all the parts on this item besides the mirror itself are made of plastic.  Figured, no problem, just about everything is these days.  All went well with the install until I was attaching the shower head to the mirror body.  The threads are actually cut in a taper (like a pipe thread).  Problem is that no modern shower head has enough threads to really engage well.  You end up stripping one or the other out.  In my case, I tried 2 different shower heads and neither even started to tighten before the threads were \\&quot;skipping\\&quot;.  I ended up cutting off about 1/4\\&quot; of threads and then everything worked well.  Just too much taper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item might work fine if you have a shower head with a very deep fitting.</li>
            <li> The mirror works as advertised. It could have a little larger mirror. It easily connected watertight to my shower head pipe.</li>
            <li> I have had a Shower Tek mirror for over 10 years now but recently it started to leak. Wanted to buy a less expensive alternative. Needless to say you get what you pay for because this mirror is a piece of crap. Plastic everything so of course it doesn&#x27;t seal properly. The connection is so flimsy to the mirror that when it fills with water the mirror flops down and forward. And just so you know, there are five very small holes on the back of the mirror used for pressure relief and they spray the water everywhere!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality and a waste of money. Buy a Shower Tek.</li>
            <li> Great product! the attachment doesnt fit some shower heads, but its easy to unscrew and use as a hand held mirror</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims to do. Does not fog up and installs easily ! Worth the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this mirror because of all the bad reviews.  Most of the bad reviews are true.  This mirror from day one will leak around the edge.  Both of mine leaked from the top edge allowing water to run down the center of the mirror blocking my view.  The other reviews about the threads not working and leading are true as well.  These issues I could have live with because I was able to fix them.  For the leaky threads I used a lot of thread tape and a rubber washer to connect it to the shower pipe.  For the threads at the exit end where you connect the shower head, I used a shut off valve.  The shut off valve was deep enough to tighten the treads to and then the shower head easily fit onto the shut off valve.  Another issue I fixed was the angle of the mirror.  Over time the mirror will hang straight down making it hard to see in.  My shower pipe is real high so I needed to angle the mirror down to see in it.  I fixed this problem by using picture hanging wire.  I connected it to the center bottom screw on its back and over the pipe and back to another screw on the back of the mirror.  This kept the mirror&#x27;s angle the same - downward.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I could have lived with all the above issues, but the one issue I could not get over was the mirror is too thin and breaks.  The first unit I have lasted 8 months before breaking.  The replacement unit I got broke on the first use.  Yes, I turn the shut off valve off to shave making most of the water and pressure to go to the mirror.  This should not be an issue, because I am on a well with a max water pressure of 80 psi.  If you do get this mirror, I would drill out the top hole on the back of the mirror making it a little bigger.  This would re-leave some of the pressure in the mirror and may prevent it from cracking.&lt;br /&gt;Over all it is a great design and does not fog, but there are too many design flaws in it for me to recommend it.</li>
            <li> This mirror performs as stated...even better than expected.  Had a big name brand previously but have found this to be a much better value and have been using it happily ever since!!!  Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I have had this mirror for about a year.  I got in the shower this morning and the mirror was cracked from edge to edge.  Up until then, it worked as advertised except for a couple of issues.  First, the joint where the mirror attaches to the water tube is not strong enough to support the weight of the mirror.  So, unless you hang the mirror directly below your shower head, it will sag.  This was a problem for me because I have soap/shampoo dispensers under the shower head.  The mirror rested on the lid of one of the soap dispensers.  The other issue I had is the water holes in the back of the mirror.  They spray a fairly strong stream of water that can get outside the shower if you are not careful.  I think the holes are too small.  I think calcium built up in these holes, clogging them, and causing the water pressure to crack my mirror.  If they were larger, they wouldn&#x27;t spray as hard and would be less likely to clog.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it!!! Cracked after a few months. They used to make a flexible model that worked great for years. Maybe the company should go back to the older better model.</li>
            <li> Mirror and general concept is good but the plastic threads are weak and leaks after using teflon tape. They should have just used a clamping system instead of running the water through it.</li>
            <li> ...i used to have a Sharper Image one on a flexible plastic link mount, and it could easily be moved to any location and stay there.  This one tends to want to sag downwards from where it&#x27;s positioned, and because it&#x27;s all plastic, you can only wind it so tight trying to make it stay in place.  The fog-free part works fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the water shoots out the back of the mirror. It would be better if it drained out the bottom.</li>
            <li> Nobel prize winning product...this is amazing....</li>
            <li> This is one of the WORSE purchases I have ever made on Amazon...the item is shody, impossible to adjust to existing shower head, it fogs up immediately and spews water out of jets in the back of the mirror....awful,awful, awful product ....rip-off....piece of junk....would cost us more to return</li>
            <li> After 3 uses the mirror began leaking around the seam between the mirror and the case allowing water to run across the mirror obstructing the view. I contacted the company and their idiotic response was that it is being used in the shower and will of course get water on it. I contacted them a second time to let them know that it was a defect that made the water leak through to the front, not my shower or the wet environment. Their final response was for me to ship it back for repair/replacement (cost to me $8-$10) and include $10 for return shipping. Add that up and I could basically purchase another one.&lt;br /&gt;My advice, find a better product from a different company.</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING. PERFECT !!!!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of this product. I returned it for a refund</li>
            <li> This mirror does not fog up from the shower steam.  My husband uses it daily and even when we&#x27;ve moved, he has had me order another one through Amazon.  He loves them.</li>
            <li> This has been in use now for many months, and no complaints at all!!  Shaving in the shower has never been easier!</li>
            <li> This may be a great fog free mirror.  It will not work in my shower, so I will never know.  In the description of the product, it was not clear that the mirror had to plumbed into the shower faucet to work.  It also had no spec about the size of the pipe.  While I didn&#x27;t really want to dismantle my shower to install the mirror, it was a different diameter and wouldn&#x27;t even fit.  The mirror is only fog free if it is plumbed in.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but would be better if it would extend. My shower head is very high, so in order to use this, I have to have it tilted at a steep angle just to use. If it would be extendable. it would have got 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 2 because there are some good points. My husband has had many shower mirrors and wasn&#x27;t really happy with any of them. We bought this and he loved it. He had it for about 3 years and knocked it off and broke the &amp;#34;arm&amp;#34;. We looked for another but they were always sold out. Found one on Amazon and bought it. He installed it and the first time he used it, the mirror shattered. Seems like it works great, just doesn&#x27;t hold up for us.</li>
