            <li>Smells great, goes on very well.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for a night cream or to take off my eye makeup at night....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizing products made for oily skin but none of them has worked for me.</li>
            <li>I hope I get greater results after a while.</li>

            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>is way better.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the feel of it on my skin.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and it also doesn&#x27;t feel like I have a mask on like so many moisturizers make your skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel, and more so love how it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li>I am sure this product would work well for some</li>
            <li>Lo and behold my face is nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this cr√®me.  </li>
            <li>My mother told me when I turned 20 to never use soap or hot/warm water on my face again and to be sure and use a moisturizer with &amp;#34;hormones&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The price is much better than in the store.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy-smells great and works well on my normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>Great product, my skin is soft and not greasy!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for everything but your face if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>you get a good amount of cream for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This cream is very nice, it seems to be just as good as the much more expensive creams and it has a good clean smell too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only economical, but the best cream I have found.  </li>
            <li>great product that I haven&#x27;t been able to find locally</li>
            <li>This is the first product that really works!!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells good, but there is really nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li>Works wonders on the fine lines around my mouth and forehead.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and easily applied.</li>
            <li>Really can&#x27;t give it an honest appraisal.  </li>
            <li>I use it every night and it leaves my face feeling so smooth without making my skin too greasy.</li>
            <li>If you are a DE Shaver like me, you will enjoy lathering this on your face to moisturize your skin, after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I just know that despite the low price tag , this is a great face cream:  </li>
            <li>The smell was light though and it made my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>My facial skin gets irritated very easily, however, this lotion is perfect for my entire face....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend St. Ives Timeless Skin!!!!</li>
            <li>This is amazing,love the texture and it doesnt leave ur face sticky,recomend this for dry skin,ive seen such a wonderful improvement in my skin,and the priceüòçüòçüòç for 2 is amazing</li>
            <li>Feels good, barely scented.</li>
            <li>and I did love it at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for moisturizing creams that can be readily accessible to me that don&#x27;t have parabens in them.</li>
            <li>That said, I would not pay the price for the original Nivea from Germany.</li>
            <li>It feels cool and light on my face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy - light, absorbs quickly, and *hopefully* is slowing the aging process.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft, it&#x27;s very reasonably priced on amazon in comparison to in stores, and it&#x27;s a good size jar for the price.</li>
            <li>Price was low and I bought the 2 pack which seemed a good deal.  </li>
            <li>My fiancee highly recommends,and I can attest to her Beauty! :-)</li>
            <li>Regardless,  it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking nice.</li>
            <li>it is soo reasonably priced give it a try you might be as pleased as I am.</li>
            <li>I liked this product but it caused irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that is not going to make me look 20 years younger - but neither is the $100+ one, no matter what they say.</li>
            <li>Buy this instead of the more expensive products and you will be very happy.</li>
            <li>Look this stuff is nice as a body moisturizer but for all those using it on your face, it really doesn&#x27;t do much for you.  </li>
            <li>I have an oily skin and this cream makes my skin super oily.</li>
            <li>I have seen a tremendous improvement in my skin since using it.  </li>
            <li>I am a 75 year old lady with excellent skin due to this produce.</li>
            <li>I am happy to be able to share this great secret with other ladies.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles are more less and not so deep, my skin is smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li>so far i love it.</li>
            <li>Good product but not as efficient as expected.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin so nice and soft and really does make it look and feel firmer...</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful facial moisturizer just like all the other products from St. Ives.</li>
            <li>and it soaks right in</li>
            <li>really makes you feel clean and relieves your face.  </li>
            <li>Most of the major pharmacies no longer carry it</li>
            <li>It is absorbed very quickly and leaves my skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>Better still, it is not only exactly what I want in a moisturizer, but it&#x27;s super affordable.</li>
            <li>He said I looked younger and more fresh.</li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>The first two ingredients are water and mineral oil.</li>
            <li>, I have always  purchased it through stores, but in sure it is the same product</li>
            <li>I have purchased countless moisturizers over the years and was never fully satisfied with any of them, but in this product I&#x27;ve found a winner.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>So absorbent, Leaves your skin soft and smooth and relaxed.</li>
            <li>It is different than I&#x27;m used to, but it seems to work ok.</li>
            <li>I bought this sometime over the summer on recommendation from a friend, and still have most of one whole jar left.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this about a week, so can&#x27;t really say what the long term will be, but it seems like a very nice moisturizer and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve searched down aisles in store trying to find something I liked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large container</li>
            <li>and although she was never vain, she certainly knew her stuff about taking care of skin.  </li>
            <li>So this product really works.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer works very well for me.</li>
            <li>It hydrates the skin very well...</li>
            <li>I really like.  </li>
            <li>It seemed light enough, but still moisturizing for my skin.</li>
            <li>34;used up&amp;#34; the whole thing before moving onto something else.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and fast service.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Light and silky, and gives my skin a glow, and the collagen definitely softens the appearance of my crows feet.</li>
            <li>I almost never wear foundation or concealer, and this product gives my face just enough light and glow to still look &amp;#34;done up&amp;#34</li>
            <li>reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for mine.</li>
            <li>Actually, I have very oily skin that needs to be washed with a special lotion between 2 and 4 times a day.</li>
            <li>This product offers quality skincare  @ a reasonable price...win-win!</li>
            <li>My skin never tires of the cool moisture and feel of St Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elasten Facial,</li>
            <li>Love this product,  Better than many other expensive creams  </li>
            <li>This is a good facial lotion to use during the summer since it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the Timeless Skin Collagen as it is a thicker cream but not heavier cream.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for all skin types.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to others...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy but does a great job and really inexpensive compared to the expensive department store brands I used.</li>
            <li>This lotion moisturizers very well without cloging pores and making sensitive skin break out.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s very moisturizing and does not negatively effect her sensitive skin, no breakouts or anything.</li>
            <li>I love this cream I put on everyday and night</li>
            <li>Mineral oil pulls moisture away from the basal cells where cells are newly formed.</li>
            <li>however I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Fine lines and wrinkles are now less visible.</li>
            <li>It smooths on evenly, absorbs fast, and really goes a long way, even when applied liberally twice a day as I have.</li>
            <li>The value is wonderful too - I&#x27;m getting tired of seeing one ounce or less tubes of the same basic facial cream selling for $100+ simply because a famous person put their name on it.  </li>
            <li>Soaks right into my dry and thirsty skin.</li>
            <li>I always had rather clear skin, and never had any bumps on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the least irritating, best moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li>It does what is intended to do, moisturize a 60 yr old face and neck with no slimy/gooey feeling.</li>
            <li>old skin too oily.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel and look so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mineral oil coats the skin like plastic wrap, disrupting the skin&#x27;s natural immune barrier and inhibiting its ability to breathe and absorb the &#x27;natural moisture factor&#x27; (moisture and nutrition).</li>
            <li>Your skin is a vital organ that needs to work with your kidneys and liver to rid the body of toxins.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and tend to have allergies to creams and soaps and the St Ives brand never bothers me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this cream didn&#x27;t cause any burning, itching or redness.</li>
            <li>and I completely agree.</li>
            <li>Rather, it feels so soft.</li>
            <li>At 76 it leaves my skin taut and soft.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised I broke out because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would caution those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product seems to have a lot of water and needs to be used frequently.  </li>
            <li>Start using it young, follow my mom&#x27;s advice and you&#x27;ll look 35 at 65.</li>
            <li>I also like the natural smell.</li>
            <li>It also slows down skin function and normal cell development, resulting in premature ageing of the skin and many other health and skin disorders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping my fine lines or not,  </li>
            <li>Not sure that they are as complex as some more expensive creams, but I just use more  and that seems to work OK.</li>
            <li>No need to spend big bucks for the fancy new products...collagen and elastin are all you need.  </li>
            <li>A decent moisturizer for anyone on a fixed budget with limited funds.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been warned by a friend that the St Ives brand in general does this when I bought it, but for the price I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if I am really going to like it.</li>
            <li>I got it to replace the Neutrogena brand of body butter that has apparently been discontinued...</li>
            <li>It is much thinner than I expected.</li>
            <li>I am 75 years old; but, people say I only look 50.  </li>
            <li>If you have normal or slightly dry skin, then this is the moisturizer for you!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, but it absorbs quickly and leaves my face looking dewy.</li>
            <li>I took her advice but over the years there have been so many expensive alternatives for &amp;#34;younger looking skin&amp;#34; being developed that just plain collagen and elastin, which are the two things really needed to keep skin young have been pushed to the back of the shelf.  </li>

            <li> I also like the design of the container, because it&#x27;s easy to scoop out a good amount in one swoop for your face/neck/chest.</li>

            <li> Smells great, goes on very well.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for a night cream or to take off my eye makeup at night....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizing products made for oily skin but none of them has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I hope I get greater results after a while.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price.</li>
            <li> Love it will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion.  </li>

            <li> The best facial product out there.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> is way better.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the feel of it on my skin.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and it also doesn&#x27;t feel like I have a mask on like so many moisturizers make your skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel, and more so love how it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> I am sure this product would work well for some</li>
            <li> Lo and behold my face is nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cr√®me.  </li>
            <li> My mother told me when I turned 20 to never use soap or hot/warm water on my face again and to be sure and use a moisturizer with &amp;#34;hormones&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The price is much better than in the store.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy-smells great and works well on my normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product, my skin is soft and not greasy!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for everything but your face if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> you get a good amount of cream for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This cream is very nice, it seems to be just as good as the much more expensive creams and it has a good clean smell too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only economical, but the best cream I have found.  </li>
            <li> great product that I haven&#x27;t been able to find locally</li>
            <li> This is the first product that really works!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, but there is really nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders on the fine lines around my mouth and forehead.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and easily applied.</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t give it an honest appraisal.  </li>
            <li> I use it every night and it leaves my face feeling so smooth without making my skin too greasy.</li>
            <li> If you are a DE Shaver like me, you will enjoy lathering this on your face to moisturize your skin, after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I just know that despite the low price tag , this is a great face cream:  </li>
            <li> The smell was light though and it made my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> My facial skin gets irritated very easily, however, this lotion is perfect for my entire face....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend St. Ives Timeless Skin!!!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing,love the texture and it doesnt leave ur face sticky,recomend this for dry skin,ive seen such a wonderful improvement in my skin,and the priceüòçüòçüòç for 2 is amazing</li>
            <li> Feels good, barely scented.</li>
            <li> and I did love it at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for moisturizing creams that can be readily accessible to me that don&#x27;t have parabens in them.</li>
            <li> That said, I would not pay the price for the original Nivea from Germany.</li>
            <li> It feels cool and light on my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy - light, absorbs quickly, and *hopefully* is slowing the aging process.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft, it&#x27;s very reasonably priced on amazon in comparison to in stores, and it&#x27;s a good size jar for the price.</li>
            <li> Price was low and I bought the 2 pack which seemed a good deal.  </li>
            <li> My fiancee highly recommends,and I can attest to her Beauty! :-)</li>
            <li> Regardless,  it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking nice.</li>
            <li> it is soo reasonably priced give it a try you might be as pleased as I am.</li>
            <li> I liked this product but it caused irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that is not going to make me look 20 years younger - but neither is the $100+ one, no matter what they say.</li>
            <li> Buy this instead of the more expensive products and you will be very happy.</li>
            <li> Look this stuff is nice as a body moisturizer but for all those using it on your face, it really doesn&#x27;t do much for you.  </li>
            <li> I have an oily skin and this cream makes my skin super oily.</li>
            <li> I have seen a tremendous improvement in my skin since using it.  </li>
            <li> I am a 75 year old lady with excellent skin due to this produce.</li>
            <li> I am happy to be able to share this great secret with other ladies.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are more less and not so deep, my skin is smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li> so far i love it.</li>
            <li> Good product but not as efficient as expected.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so nice and soft and really does make it look and feel firmer...</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial moisturizer just like all the other products from St. Ives.</li>
            <li> and it soaks right in</li>
            <li> really makes you feel clean and relieves your face.  </li>
            <li> Most of the major pharmacies no longer carry it</li>
            <li> It is absorbed very quickly and leaves my skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li> Better still, it is not only exactly what I want in a moisturizer, but it&#x27;s super affordable.</li>
            <li> He said I looked younger and more fresh.</li>
            <li> Really like it!</li>
            <li> The first two ingredients are water and mineral oil.</li>
            <li> , I have always  purchased it through stores, but in sure it is the same product</li>
            <li> I have purchased countless moisturizers over the years and was never fully satisfied with any of them, but in this product I&#x27;ve found a winner.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> So absorbent, Leaves your skin soft and smooth and relaxed.</li>
            <li> It is different than I&#x27;m used to, but it seems to work ok.</li>
            <li> I bought this sometime over the summer on recommendation from a friend, and still have most of one whole jar left.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this about a week, so can&#x27;t really say what the long term will be, but it seems like a very nice moisturizer and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve searched down aisles in store trying to find something I liked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large container</li>
            <li> and although she was never vain, she certainly knew her stuff about taking care of skin.  </li>
            <li> So this product really works.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works very well for me.</li>
            <li> It hydrates the skin very well...</li>
            <li> I really like.  </li>
            <li> It seemed light enough, but still moisturizing for my skin.</li>
            <li> 34;used up&amp;#34; the whole thing before moving onto something else.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and fast service.  </li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Light and silky, and gives my skin a glow, and the collagen definitely softens the appearance of my crows feet.</li>
            <li> I almost never wear foundation or concealer, and this product gives my face just enough light and glow to still look &amp;#34;done up&amp;#34</li>
            <li> reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for mine.</li>
            <li> Actually, I have very oily skin that needs to be washed with a special lotion between 2 and 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> This product offers quality skincare  @ a reasonable price...win-win!</li>
            <li> My skin never tires of the cool moisture and feel of St Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elasten Facial,</li>
            <li> Love this product,  Better than many other expensive creams  </li>
            <li> This is a good facial lotion to use during the summer since it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the Timeless Skin Collagen as it is a thicker cream but not heavier cream.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for all skin types.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to others...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy but does a great job and really inexpensive compared to the expensive department store brands I used.</li>
            <li> This lotion moisturizers very well without cloging pores and making sensitive skin break out.</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s very moisturizing and does not negatively effect her sensitive skin, no breakouts or anything.</li>
            <li> I love this cream I put on everyday and night</li>
            <li> Mineral oil pulls moisture away from the basal cells where cells are newly formed.</li>
            <li> however I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Fine lines and wrinkles are now less visible.</li>
            <li> It smooths on evenly, absorbs fast, and really goes a long way, even when applied liberally twice a day as I have.</li>
            <li> The value is wonderful too - I&#x27;m getting tired of seeing one ounce or less tubes of the same basic facial cream selling for $100+ simply because a famous person put their name on it.  </li>
            <li> Soaks right into my dry and thirsty skin.</li>
            <li> I always had rather clear skin, and never had any bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the least irritating, best moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li> It does what is intended to do, moisturize a 60 yr old face and neck with no slimy/gooey feeling.</li>
            <li> old skin too oily.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel and look so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mineral oil coats the skin like plastic wrap, disrupting the skin&#x27;s natural immune barrier and inhibiting its ability to breathe and absorb the &#x27;natural moisture factor&#x27; (moisture and nutrition).</li>
            <li> Your skin is a vital organ that needs to work with your kidneys and liver to rid the body of toxins.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tend to have allergies to creams and soaps and the St Ives brand never bothers me.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this cream didn&#x27;t cause any burning, itching or redness.</li>
            <li> and I completely agree.</li>
            <li> Rather, it feels so soft.</li>
            <li> At 76 it leaves my skin taut and soft.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised I broke out because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would caution those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product seems to have a lot of water and needs to be used frequently.  </li>
            <li> Start using it young, follow my mom&#x27;s advice and you&#x27;ll look 35 at 65.</li>
            <li> I also like the natural smell.</li>
            <li> It also slows down skin function and normal cell development, resulting in premature ageing of the skin and many other health and skin disorders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping my fine lines or not,  </li>
            <li> Not sure that they are as complex as some more expensive creams, but I just use more  and that seems to work OK.</li>
            <li> No need to spend big bucks for the fancy new products...collagen and elastin are all you need.  </li>
            <li> A decent moisturizer for anyone on a fixed budget with limited funds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been warned by a friend that the St Ives brand in general does this when I bought it, but for the price I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if I am really going to like it.</li>
            <li> I got it to replace the Neutrogena brand of body butter that has apparently been discontinued...</li>
            <li> It is much thinner than I expected.</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old; but, people say I only look 50.  </li>
            <li> If you have normal or slightly dry skin, then this is the moisturizer for you!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but it absorbs quickly and leaves my face looking dewy.</li>
            <li> I took her advice but over the years there have been so many expensive alternatives for &amp;#34;younger looking skin&amp;#34; being developed that just plain collagen and elastin, which are the two things really needed to keep skin young have been pushed to the back of the shelf.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a far way.</li>
            <li> I would order a 2-pack again because it is does not go a long way</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s done anything to my wrinkles, but it makes my skin FEEL smoother, and softer than it has felt in a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and luxurious, and really, truly moisturizes your face like nothing else.  </li>
            <li> A jar for me lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I would describe it as &amp;#34;comforting&amp;#34; to dry skin...</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin felt thin and dry and it has really improved the overall look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m really particular on the consistency of the cream and don&#x27;t like anything that&#x27;s too thick or oily.</li>
            <li> On an extreme low budget however, this could do between other products.</li>
            <li> My husband also uses it for his REALLY rough dry hands.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way with this facial mostierizer</li>
            <li> I use it every morning, and every other night.</li>
            <li> Works well at a fraction of the cost of the other creams.</li>
            <li> Oz recommended this cream, as I know other people have as well.</li>
            <li> I have used the other collegan elastin moisturizer by St. Ives and this formula</li>
            <li> Mostly due to St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin</li>
            <li> I have been using St Ives Moisturizer for years and was very disappointed not to be able to purchase it in my local store.</li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t know if I have less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This in turn slows down the cell renewal rate that breaks down the collagen and elastin and then begins to destroy the connective tissue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few months.</li>
            <li> One of the few face creams  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I had been using a collagen gel for years but had trouble finding an elastin product.  </li>
            <li> But after reading other reviews, it seems to be fairly common with this product.</li>
            <li> It does heavy duty work but doesn&#x27;t go on thick or goopy.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what caused the bumps from this cream specifically, but I don&#x27;t plan on ever buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this moisturizer in my usual stores and it&#x27;s nowhere to be found</li>
            <li> Seems alright but not sure yet.</li>
            <li> Hardly.  </li>
            <li> lke Nivea because the cream is not as thick.  </li>
            <li> even around the delicate eye area!</li>
            <li> We tend to think that any product with a small price tag must be inferior, but tests have proven that premise wrong.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so thick and creamy!</li>
            <li> Hard to find anymore!!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about getting this...</li>
            <li> I bought this here because its was impossible to find around town.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t use it on my face because it causes me to break out terribly.</li>
            <li> This gave me the worst rash.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product for everything but your face if you have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s a large container so it lasts for a while when used on larger areas. I just can&#x27;t use it on my face because it causes me to break out terribly. I&#x27;d been warned by a friend that the St Ives brand in general does this when I bought it, but for the price I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. If you&#x27;re prone to break outs think twice before getting this for your face!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. A little goes a far way.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!! This is the first product that really works!!!!! I applied it yesterday evening, and this morning, my husband asked me today what I did to my face..... I asked why???? He said I looked younger and more fresh. So this product really works. My wrinkles are more less and not so deep, my skin is smooth and looks great. A wonderful product to a reasonable price. I really would recommend it to everybody that looks for a very good anti wrinkle cream. :) Thank you for a wonderful product that really works.</li>
            <li> Fine lines and wrinkles are now less visible. My skin seems younger and firmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a year now and I love it! A jar for me lasts for a very long time. I use it every morning, and every other night. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream! Soothing and doesn&#x27;t cause me any allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Works well at a fraction of the cost of the other creams.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works very well for me. Feels very calming to the skin and keeps it in great condition.</li>
            <li> Hard to find anymore!!  Really like it!</li>
            <li> A lot of very nice skin cream for not a lot of money.  My facial skin gets irritated very easily, however, this lotion is perfect for my entire face....even around the delicate eye area!</li>
            <li> It does what is intended to do, moisturize a 60 yr old face and neck with no slimy/gooey feeling. This is an essential for all ages.</li>
            <li> This was given to my girlfriend as a gift. She says it&#x27;s very moisturizing and does not negatively effect her sensitive skin, no breakouts or anything.</li>
            <li> This is a good facial lotion to use during the summer since it&#x27;s not too heavy. I use this as preventative measure for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Fantastic - Recommended by Dr Oz and its cost effective and good. Buy this instead of the more expensive products and you will be very happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few months. I like the smell of it. I like that you get a good amount of cream for a reasonable price. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. But, I don&#x27;t know if I have less wrinkles. Anyways, my daughters like it and I will continue to use it. I would recommend this item to others.</li>
            <li> Love the results, bought two jars &amp; will buy more</li>
            <li> Not sure that they are as complex as some more expensive creams, but I just use more  and that seems to work OK.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial moisturizer just like all the other products from St. Ives. You can&#x27;t beat the price here at Amazon and you can&#x27;t beat the results with a more expensive product either. Highly recommend this for all skin types. I have dry skin but I don&#x27;t like a lot of moisturizers because they make my 66 yr. old skin too oily. This product absorbs and does the job without that oily feeling. It makes my face feel and look so soft.</li>
            <li> St. Ives skin products are the best. This is a great moisturizer that is non-greasy and makes skin look amazing. Plus, it&#x27;s affordable. A little goes a long way, but it absorbs quickly and leaves my face looking dewy. I love St. Ives</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used...I got it to replace the Neutrogena brand of body butter that has apparently been discontinued...I was skeptical about getting this...Price was low and I bought the 2 pack which seemed a good deal.  It hydrates the skin very well...It is absorbed very quickly and leaves my skin feeling so soft.  I would describe it as &amp;#34;comforting&amp;#34; to dry skin...I use it day and night.  The smell is very nice and not overpowering at all...I am so glad I found it and I highly recommend it to others...</li>
            <li> so far i love it. i am using on my chest as well and the skin is improving.</li>
            <li> Second time purchase!</li>
            <li> Look this stuff is nice as a body moisturizer but for all those using it on your face, it really doesn&#x27;t do much for you.  I&#x27;d go with the Eclos or Dermalogica night creams - they are rich and wonderful.  On an extreme low budget however, this could do between other products.</li>
            <li> One of the few face creams  I really like.  Does an excellent job moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation unlike many I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Feel good and does seem to tighten up some skin,</li>
            <li> Love this product. Feels good, barely scented. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found and the best price too!  I gave one to my mother and now she won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Good product but not as efficient as expected.</li>
            <li> The first two ingredients are water and mineral oil. This also contains Phenoxyethanol which is toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil coats the skin like plastic wrap, disrupting the skin&#x27;s natural immune barrier and inhibiting its ability to breathe and absorb the &#x27;natural moisture factor&#x27; (moisture and nutrition). Your skin is a vital organ that needs to work with your kidneys and liver to rid the body of toxins. Anything that interferes with this transfer system blocks the elimination of toxins. The skin needs to attract moisture to stave off infection and bacteria. Mineral oil pulls moisture away from the basal cells where cells are newly formed. This in turn slows down the cell renewal rate that breaks down the collagen and elastin and then begins to destroy the connective tissue. It also slows down skin function and normal cell development, resulting in premature ageing of the skin and many other health and skin disorders.</li>
            <li> This cream is great. I have sensitive skin and tend to have allergies to creams and soaps and the St Ives brand never bothers me. I particularly like the Timeless Skin Collagen as it is a thicker cream but not heavier cream. It goes on smoothly and provides great moisturizing. I put some on whenever I wash my face or shower.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream, leaves skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> If you have normal or slightly dry skin, then this is the moisturizer for you! It does heavy duty work but doesn&#x27;t go on thick or goopy. It works great as a body lotion as well. It has a light, pleasant smell and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite moisturizer ever, I order two jars and will order again</li>
            <li> I fell into the trap of believing that Dr.Oz recommended this cream, as I know other people have as well. I got this and I did love it at first. It seemed light enough, but still moisturizing for my skin. I have sensitive skin, and this cream didn&#x27;t cause any burning, itching or redness. After about a month of using this I noticed that I kept getting pimple like bumps all over my face. I always had rather clear skin, and never had any bumps on my face. I stopped using this for a month, and I noticed that the bumps had disappeared. I am not sure what caused the bumps from this cream specifically, but I don&#x27;t plan on ever buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great product, my skin is soft and not greasy! It gives a shine to my skin. So fat so good!</li>
            <li> best face lotion out there. Moisturizing but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Just started using it.  Really can&#x27;t give it an honest appraisal.  Therefore, I&#x27;m going with what I think at this time.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of a friend.  I seriously love it.  My skin felt thin and dry and it has really improved the overall look and feel of my skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> girl friend likes the product</li>
            <li> Love this product. Only one I&#x27;ve tried that worked with my allergies.</li>
            <li> Using this for almost a year now, and I absolutely love t! Works wonders on the fine lines around my mouth and forehead. Just an excellent moisturizer overall. PLUS, works so well under makeup! TRY IT!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face lotion for years and absolutely love it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling, like some lotions do.</li>
            <li> I have been using St Ives Moisturizer for years and was very disappointed not to be able to purchase it in my local store. But now am extremely happy to find it obtainable on line.  I am a 75 year old lady with excellent skin due to this produce. I am happy to be able to share this great secret with other ladies.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but there is really nothing special about it.  It is much thinner than I expected.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful..it makes my skin so nice and soft and really does make it look and feel firmer...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. It is a great, non-greasy, light moisturizer. I get many compliments on lack of wrinkles on my face- even at my age.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my hands and feet - though it is not made for that. Why not - it works for me?</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on very well. Very light and great for the price. St. Ives is one of the only budget creams that I trust.</li>
            <li> I Like it. I use it at night..</li>
            <li> My fiancee highly recommends,and I can attest to her Beauty! :-) This product offers quality skincare  @ a reasonable price...win-win!</li>
            <li> The only lotion that I have ever &amp;#34;used up&amp;#34; the whole thing before moving onto something else. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy - light, absorbs quickly, and *hopefully* is slowing the aging process. I am 26 - so I use it just because I like it, and hope that it has preventative powers against aging lol... but even if it wasn&#x27;t advertised as an anti-aging product, I would still just use it because I like the feeling it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve used it for a year as directed. Great results. I&#x27;d recommend it for routine skin care.</li>
            <li> Good price. good product.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! I saw results in two days! Healthy looking skin! Nice and lightly for those with oily skin! Also. Makes fade very smooth! Try it!</li>
            <li> It feels so smooth on my face, its a great moisturizer, after rinsing your face has this fresh look and feel. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Slaver it on my face after a shower.  Walmart was out of it when I when there for my bi-weekly shopping trip, so I checked to see if Amazon has it.  And thank goodness, they did!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very good.  Fast delivery and fast service.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for a night cream or to take off my eye makeup at night....Ive never got in online, I have always  purchased it through stores, but in sure it is the same product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for moisturizing creams that can be readily accessible to me that don&#x27;t have parabens in them. But I&#x27;m really particular on the consistency of the cream and don&#x27;t like anything that&#x27;s too thick or oily. I have dry skin and I&#x27;ve searched down aisles in store trying to find something I liked. I came across St. Ives and found that all of their products are paraben-free. I decided to try this one and Iove it. It has a pleasant smell and I love the consistency of it. It makes my skin feel so soft, it&#x27;s very reasonably priced on amazon in comparison to in stores, and it&#x27;s a good size jar for the price.</li>
            <li> I am a regular purchaser of this skin cream.  I really like it and it is also affordable. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist friend says this is the only moisturizer you need and I completely agree. It&#x27;s not heavy but does a great job and really inexpensive compared to the expensive department store brands I used. My husband also uses it for his REALLY rough dry hands. Great inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> I just got my order this evening. I applied it after using the Volcanic Mud Facial Mask from Amazon. Actually, I have very oily skin that needs to be washed with a special lotion between 2 and 4 times a day. I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizing products made for oily skin but none of them has worked for me. This is the only moisturizer not making my skin feels oily or shiny. Rather, it feels so soft. I hope I get greater results after a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product four or five times now and am out here today to buy this two-pack again. I LOVE this moisturizer! I haven&#x27;t used anything else since I discovered it about three years ago. Light and silky, and gives my skin a glow, and the collagen definitely softens the appearance of my crows feet. (I&#x27;m 56.) I&#x27;ve started using it on the backs of my hands in hopes I can stall the inevitable &amp;#34;old lady hands&amp;#34; look and it does seem to be reducing the crepe-iness on the thinner skin there. I don&#x27;t have skin allergies and nothing seems to cause me to break out, so I can&#x27;t speak to that problem that some others have had. I Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price.</li>
            <li> I have an oily skin and this cream makes my skin super oily. i am going to end up using this as a body lotion.</li>
            <li> Smear this stuff all over my arms, chest, neck and face before bed. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this cream I put on everyday and night</li>
            <li> the best stuff ever.  I use it on my face, neck and chest area that is exposed to sun.  Love it will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I have seen a tremendous improvement in my skin since using it.  Thank you for a geat product.</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion.  It&#x27;s non-greasy-smells great and works well on my normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It isn&#x27;t heavy and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping my fine lines or not,  but i think it is. Regardless,  it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking nice.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. I use mine all over and it soaks right in</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST!!  I use it every night and it leaves my face feeling so smooth without making my skin too greasy.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time.  It&#x27;s not only economical, but the best cream I have found.  At 76 it leaves my skin taut and soft.  What more can one ask for?</li>
            <li> The best facial product out there.  really makes you feel clean and relieves your face.  very good quality</li>
            <li> I ordered this moisturizer because I trust St. Ives products.  It&#x27;s lightweight compared to most others! I keep mine in the refrigerator...goes on cold...and it stays on all day... and I feel it&#x27;s doing the job!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I have used the other collegan elastin moisturizer by St. Ives and this formula is way better. I love the scent and the feel of it on my skin. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it also doesn&#x27;t feel like I have a mask on like so many moisturizers make your skin feel. I will reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years.  It&#x27;s the least irritating, best moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  Just wish it came in a pump rather than a big tub which can collect dust/lose moisture every time it is opened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years. It&#x27;s the only one out there with collagen and elastin. Most of the major pharmacies no longer carry it so I was happy to find a twin pack online.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so thick and creamy! A little goes a very long way with this facial mostierizer, I apply it every night to my face and neck. Don&#x27;t think twice about buying this!</li>
            <li> This made me break out terribly in a tiny whitehead rash all over my face and neck. Otherwise I would have loved it. I was really surprised I broke out because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. But after reading other reviews, it seems to be fairly common with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this sometime over the summer on recommendation from a friend, and still have most of one whole jar left. It smooths on evenly, absorbs fast, and really goes a long way, even when applied liberally twice a day as I have. I love the way it makes my skin feel, and more so love how it makes my skin look. I almost never wear foundation or concealer, and this product gives my face just enough light and glow to still look &amp;#34;done up&amp;#34;, even undone. I have purchased countless moisturizers over the years and was never fully satisfied with any of them, but in this product I&#x27;ve found a winner. Better still, it is not only exactly what I want in a moisturizer, but it&#x27;s super affordable. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> I am sure this product would work well for some however I have very sensitive skin so it caused my skin to not only burn/tingle but caused redness and rash.  I would caution those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  Not greasy and seems to work on keeping skin supple.  No offensive odor.</li>
            <li> Great product-Great Price!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It was mentioned in a beauty blog I follow and decided to give it a try since it&#x27;s so affordable. I&#x27;ve found some cheaper moisturizers can leave a film after they soak in your skin. I am happy to report that this product is not one of them! I also like the design of the container, because it&#x27;s easy to scoop out a good amount in one swoop for your face/neck/chest. I&#x27;ve purchased this several times and will continue to.</li>
            <li> This product seems to have a lot of water and needs to be used frequently.  I will not get it again.</li>
            <li> Love this it is great I wash my face with it.</li>
            <li> Using this for years. All st. Ives products work well and reasonably priced as well. Great hydration. Use along with cleanser.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found in many years of searching.  Being a sun abuser collagen was zapped out of my body/face.  Told by a doctor to use this product.  Lo and behold my face is nice and smooth.  I was recommended to apply twice a day.  If I keep using this product my nick name may become &amp;#34;Baby Face&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It smells good but it made my skin break out.</li>
            <li> A good price for a good product.  A decent moisturizer for anyone on a fixed budget with limited funds.  I would order a 2-pack again because it is does not go a long way lke Nivea because the cream is not as thick.  That said, I would not pay the price for the original Nivea from Germany.</li>
            <li> great product that I haven&#x27;t been able to find locally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week and already see a difference! I use it morning &amp; night, so happy I made the right choice in buying this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cr√®me.  My mother told me when I turned 20 to never use soap or hot/warm water on my face again and to be sure and use a moisturizer with &amp;#34;hormones&amp;#34;  which is what she called Collagen and Elastin.  That was back in 1970.  She was a photographers model in the 30&#x27;s and although she was never vain, she certainly knew her stuff about taking care of skin.  I took her advice but over the years there have been so many expensive alternatives for &amp;#34;younger looking skin&amp;#34; being developed that just plain collagen and elastin, which are the two things really needed to keep skin young have been pushed to the back of the shelf.  I had been using a collagen gel for years but had trouble finding an elastin product.  This was a find and I highly recommend it.  So good to feel on your face.  No need to spend big bucks for the fancy new products...collagen and elastin are all you need.  Start using it young, follow my mom&#x27;s advice and you&#x27;ll look 35 at 65.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this about a week, so can&#x27;t really say what the long term will be, but it seems like a very nice moisturizer and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I love this product, its a nice lightweight moisturizer for my face. The price is much better than in the store.</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old; but, people say I only look 50.  Mostly due to St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Dancer</li>
            <li> If you are a DE Shaver like me, you will enjoy lathering this on your face to moisturize your skin, after shaving.  It is thick and luxurious, and really, truly moisturizes your face like nothing else.  The price is very reasonable, and the ingredients collagen and elastin are the best thing you can put on your skin.  Also has a wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a face cream with collegian or Elastin and this cream was the only one that had both. We tend to think that any product with a small price tag must be inferior, but tests have proven that premise wrong. I just know that despite the low price tag , this is a great face cream:  it&#x27;s light and easily applied. It feels cool and light on my face so I tend to use it liberally.  I just love it. I use it for everything. I use it to smear off my makeup. I use it under my make up and even use as a night cream. Did I mention that I love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used...  I like the fact that it contains collagen/elastin!  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s done anything to my wrinkles, but it makes my skin FEEL smoother, and softer than it has felt in a long time.  The cream is light, and cool, and feels great on my skin.  I wear it under my foundation, and use it as a night cream.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch to anything else!  I highly recommend St. Ives Timeless Skin!!!!</li>
            <li> Have used this cream off and on over the years- works great, and you get a lot for the price. I smear it all over my face, neck and chest. I also like the natural smell.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I bought this here because its was impossible to find around town.  I definatly would recomend this to anyone looking for a good product at a great price.  What the heck it is soo reasonably priced give it a try you might be as pleased as I am.</li>
            <li> This cream is very nice, it seems to be just as good as the much more expensive creams and it has a good clean smell too! I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> St Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Facial&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. My skin never tires of the cool moisture and feel of St Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elasten Facial, So absorbent, Leaves your skin soft and smooth and relaxed. Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;N. K. Tucson:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product.  Miracle cream?  Hardly.  But it has a nice scent, goes on well, not greasy at all.  Would I buy it again? Yeah, I do like it, but don&#x27;t expect it to transform your face. It didn&#x27;t do much for mine. But it feels good.</li>
            <li> Purchased because Dr Oz said it was a good product.  As I have been looking for products&lt;br /&gt;without chemicals, I decided to try it.  It is different than I&#x27;m used to, but it seems to work ok.</li>
            <li> For some reason my face tingled with this.  The smell was light though and it made my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this</li>
            <li> I liked this product but it caused irritation to my sensitive skin. It also feels like it builds up over time.</li>
            <li> This is amazing,love the texture and it doesnt leave ur face sticky,recomend this for dry skin,ive seen such a wonderful improvement in my skin,and the priceüòçüòçüòç for 2 is amazing</li>
            <li> GREAT CREAM AM  OR PM</li>
            <li> This lotion moisturizers very well without cloging pores and making sensitive skin break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this moisturizer in my usual stores and it&#x27;s nowhere to be found so I&#x27;m really happy to find it on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs into the skin well and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  A 10 ounce container lasts quite a while and I use it morning and at night. The value is wonderful too - I&#x27;m getting tired of seeing one ounce or less tubes of the same basic facial cream selling for $100+ simply because a famous person put their name on it.  This is a good product that is not going to make me look 20 years younger - but neither is the $100+ one, no matter what they say.</li>
            <li> This gave me the worst rash.</li>
            <li> Will always be my favorite moisturizer!!! It was on dr oz a year ago for being the best and ever since I have been using it and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if I am really going to like it. Seems alright but not sure yet.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  Better than many other expensive creams  Soaks right into my dry and thirsty skin.</li>
