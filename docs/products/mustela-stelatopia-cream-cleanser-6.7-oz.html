            <li>, I tried a combination of Honest Company&#x27;s bath wash, Vanicream and Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>You have to use some kind of oil after the shower if your skin has problems with dryness.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!!!</li>
            <li>This has been great for my 2 year olds skin after she experienced some sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li>I found this cleanser is very easy to wash off</li>
            <li>make my mistake in thinking all natural is always the best.</li>
            <li>make my mistake in thinking all natural is always the best.</li>
            <li>Have been looking for suitable alternatives and have since been alternating with Aveeno Baby Cleansing Therapy.</li>
            <li>This creamy wash is perfect for his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest miracle ever for sensitive, irritated skin or cradle cap, you can use as a body wash and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Designed for babies, but suitable for adults.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>and my baby is safe with this product.</li>
            <li>(Badger is mostly olive oil.)</li>
            <li>I would have stuck with them if they had worked because I love the ingredients and EWG (Environmental Working Group) ratings, but they just did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is my winning combination:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products for my eczema-prone skin, none of which worked.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser..</li>
            <li>I use cetaphil formulated for eczema because it&#x27;s safe on babies 3 months and up.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>

            <li>Helps my toddlers skin immediately and leaves it looking amazingly healthy.</li>
            <li>A lot of cleansers strip your skin, causing it to produce more oil and resulting in acne.</li>
            <li>What can we say, it works, but we just need to pay more for it</li>
            <li>With in a day or two of using this his skin was so much better.  </li>
            <li>We absolutely love this body cleanser.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my daughters extream dry skin</li>
            <li>Very mild.</li>
            <li>We noticed improvement very quickly and could see the difference if we ever stopped using it</li>
            <li>the Stelatopia cream cleanser by Mustela is the most reliable and consistent!  </li>
            <li>Pure, lovely and light!  </li>
            <li>It has a light lather but rinses clean easily.</li>
            <li>I am a huge stelatopia fan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had eczema my whole life, so I&#x27;ve tried everything from Eucerin to my own home made stuff.</li>
            <li>The best product on the market for mixed baby skin we have no problem since using this product, we would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also started to use this stuff as a face wash and am hoping it will have the same amazing results there!</li>
            <li>Love this whole skin line!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product for my newborn&#x27;s eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li>So glad I did because as predicted our precious guy has sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>The cleansing &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; takes some getting use to - but it is soooo worth it!  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>Does a great job with gentle cleaning and works well with their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This brand by far helps the most!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old, and I love this product!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love all three products, esp.</li>
            <li>We have been using for 2 years now and his eczema has been so much better thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>It builds a nice lather, cleans well (even cleans waterproof makeup), and leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST product out there, and I tell everyone I meet that has a child with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>We use this on his whole body and his hair and seem to clean his hair just fine.  </li>
            <li>I rarely review products on Amazon but felt like this amazing product garnered a positive review so that more people with similar skin problems will try it.</li>
            <li>There is no unpleasant \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; smell to it, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>Lasts for a good long while too!</li>
            <li>The soap is gentle, has no fragrant, and easily rinses off without drying out her skin.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best baby wash for sensitive and/or eczema-prone skin.</li>
            <li>and I am off prescription steroid cream for the first time in years!  </li>
            <li>This is truly the best wash for a baby (or any human) with dry, itchy, eczema prone skin!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip moisture like most of the cleansers for sensitive skin still seem to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Mustela products have been the only effective creams, cleansers, and shampoos.  </li>
            <li>TOTALLY worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Excellent gentle cream cleanser for people with eczema or other sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I find this formula superior to other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This moisturizing cream is THE BEST of both worlds - sinks in better than a typical LOTION, but doesn&#x27;t leave as much sticky residue as an OIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>tried once on the shower and for me was not the right one</li>
            <li>I have gotten one for myself and use it during the winter to combat the dried out winter skin I get on my own face!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re pleased with how gentle and moisturizing this cleanser has been so far.</li>
            <li>This product is very gentle and cleans well.  </li>
            <li>someone who has suffered for years &amp; tried every product on the market, I am very thankful I found this product!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>The next morning after using my baby&#x27;s skin looked so much better.</li>
            <li>This cleanser and Aveeno Eczema lotion are what keep her legs clear and itch free.</li>
            <li>We love Mustela baby products and has only used this brand for our daughter.</li>
            <li>My hands feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My daughter had baby eczema, every cleanser would just dry her skin even more.  </li>
            <li>2 in 1 soap and things were going well with it until she developed a mild case of eczema.  </li>
            <li>The affected area would be really red after using, but it cleared everything up very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented, makes an amazing lather and leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft, not dry like some other &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; soaps.</li>
            <li>I really believe that this product, along with a change in my diet, cleared up the eczema on my hands that I had been struggling with for years.</li>
            <li>The stuff does really help to control/contain ezcema (outbreaks)</li>
            <li>Gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help with eczema</li>
            <li>I bought the whole Mustela arsenal of milk oil, soap and lotion.</li>
            <li>Gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>We use it for washing her whole body, and she is now 2.</li>
            <li>He doesnt have a whole lot of hair which maybe that would make a difference as to how it works on hair.</li>
            <li>It gently removes make up and oil and leaves my face smooth and clean without feeling tight.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We use only one full pump of the cleanser and lather it up with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Now that she&#x27;s a bit older</li>
            <li>I rarely break out using this product, and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend the Mustela brand and this cream cleanser.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s skin was so sensitive she needed &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; for it and Mustela worked for her!!</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s skin was so sensitive she needed &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; for it and Mustela worked for her!!</li>
            <li>Mild product that does not dry the skin or leave a film for adults with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that keeps her skin calm and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It is working very well for our 6 month old son.</li>
            <li>A friend suggested switching his shampoo/soap to something fragrance free, and after looking at amazon reviews for a few different products, this seemed to fit the bill.</li>
            <li>although it is supposedly for sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t really work like it is.</li>
            <li>This cream cleanser is gentle and makes your skin feel soft  and helps with any type of rash.</li>
            <li>My son has super sensitive skin, and this cleanser actually worsened his condition, so I&#x27;m going to return this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My son has very sensitive skin and Mustela is 1 out o 2 brands (</li>
            <li>This is the only brand I&#x27;ve trusted since my daughter was first born.</li>
            <li>only product I have found that consistently works for these issues.</li>
            <li>It helps clear things up within days.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive hands, history of eczema and contact dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Angel Baby Oil (from Earth Mama Angel Baby, just for an added all natural element, to get the calendula in there, and to help her scalp.</li>
            <li>As a mother I wash my hands frequently and as a result my eczema would flare up on my hands.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to agree with the person who said this product was not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>keeps my toddler&#x27;s skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Works for my daughters who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter loves this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>bath stuff for his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My son had had eczema since he was 6 months old.</li>
            <li>I use it on my sensitive skin and on my toddler&#x27;s eczema-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>So far, this soap seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>if only they had seen it with her dry, scaly, eczema breakouts to see the true difference.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but worth it for us!</li>
            <li>This was the only lotion that helped clear up the eczema on my hands!!</li>
            <li>My 9 month old has very sensitive skin, especially under his chin and on his neck.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I have used on my son since he developed eczema at 4 months old.</li>
            <li>I suffer from blepharitis and dry eyes, I had tried using other baby shampoos (Johnsons and California Baby), special washes and scrubs per my doctors</li>
            <li>I tried all kinds of different lotions to clear it up and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>My daughter is almost 3 years old now and has only had 2 flare ups from eczema, which I had to use a cream prescribed by her pediatrician.</li>
            <li>The reason why I&#x27;m saying that it works so far is that this soap along with different types of moisturizing creams (not the product by itself) have shown an improvement on her skin.  </li>
            <li>after the first couple of uses, I started to see marked improvements, until it all went away after only a few weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li>Her skin is not dry after bath with this.</li>
            <li>but, if your skin is very sensitive and dry, this product is for you.  </li>
            <li>As a frequent hand washer (no, I&#x27;m not ODD), my hands itch and look rough and red.</li>
            <li>Her skin is dry and sensitive and it is the only product that works for her.</li>
            <li>My 2 month old had very dry, flaky skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does a great job with gentle cleaning and works well with their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This brand by far helps the most!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old, and I love this product!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love all three products, esp.</li>
            <li> We have been using for 2 years now and his eczema has been so much better thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> It builds a nice lather, cleans well (even cleans waterproof makeup), and leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST product out there, and I tell everyone I meet that has a child with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> We use this on his whole body and his hair and seem to clean his hair just fine.  </li>
            <li> I rarely review products on Amazon but felt like this amazing product garnered a positive review so that more people with similar skin problems will try it.</li>
            <li> There is no unpleasant \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; smell to it, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a good long while too!</li>
            <li> The soap is gentle, has no fragrant, and easily rinses off without drying out her skin.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best baby wash for sensitive and/or eczema-prone skin.</li>
            <li> and I am off prescription steroid cream for the first time in years!  </li>
            <li> This is truly the best wash for a baby (or any human) with dry, itchy, eczema prone skin!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip moisture like most of the cleansers for sensitive skin still seem to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Mustela products have been the only effective creams, cleansers, and shampoos.  </li>
            <li> TOTALLY worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Excellent gentle cream cleanser for people with eczema or other sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I find this formula superior to other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing cream is THE BEST of both worlds - sinks in better than a typical LOTION, but doesn&#x27;t leave as much sticky residue as an OIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried once on the shower and for me was not the right one</li>
            <li> I have gotten one for myself and use it during the winter to combat the dried out winter skin I get on my own face!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re pleased with how gentle and moisturizing this cleanser has been so far.</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle and cleans well.  </li>
            <li> someone who has suffered for years &amp; tried every product on the market, I am very thankful I found this product!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> The next morning after using my baby&#x27;s skin looked so much better.</li>
            <li> This cleanser and Aveeno Eczema lotion are what keep her legs clear and itch free.</li>
            <li> We love Mustela baby products and has only used this brand for our daughter.</li>
            <li> My hands feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My daughter had baby eczema, every cleanser would just dry her skin even more.  </li>
            <li> 2 in 1 soap and things were going well with it until she developed a mild case of eczema.  </li>
            <li> The affected area would be really red after using, but it cleared everything up very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented, makes an amazing lather and leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft, not dry like some other &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; soaps.</li>
            <li> I really believe that this product, along with a change in my diet, cleared up the eczema on my hands that I had been struggling with for years.</li>
            <li> The stuff does really help to control/contain ezcema (outbreaks)</li>
            <li> Gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help with eczema</li>
            <li> I bought the whole Mustela arsenal of milk oil, soap and lotion.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> We use it for washing her whole body, and she is now 2.</li>
            <li> He doesnt have a whole lot of hair which maybe that would make a difference as to how it works on hair.</li>
            <li> It gently removes make up and oil and leaves my face smooth and clean without feeling tight.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We use only one full pump of the cleanser and lather it up with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Now that she&#x27;s a bit older</li>
            <li> I rarely break out using this product, and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend the Mustela brand and this cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s skin was so sensitive she needed &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; for it and Mustela worked for her!!</li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s skin was so sensitive she needed &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; for it and Mustela worked for her!!</li>
            <li> Mild product that does not dry the skin or leave a film for adults with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that keeps her skin calm and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It is working very well for our 6 month old son.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested switching his shampoo/soap to something fragrance free, and after looking at amazon reviews for a few different products, this seemed to fit the bill.</li>
            <li> although it is supposedly for sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t really work like it is.</li>
            <li> This cream cleanser is gentle and makes your skin feel soft  and helps with any type of rash.</li>
            <li> My son has super sensitive skin, and this cleanser actually worsened his condition, so I&#x27;m going to return this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin and Mustela is 1 out o 2 brands (</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I&#x27;ve trusted since my daughter was first born.</li>
            <li> only product I have found that consistently works for these issues.</li>
            <li> It helps clear things up within days.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive hands, history of eczema and contact dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Angel Baby Oil (from Earth Mama Angel Baby, just for an added all natural element, to get the calendula in there, and to help her scalp.</li>
            <li> As a mother I wash my hands frequently and as a result my eczema would flare up on my hands.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to agree with the person who said this product was not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> keeps my toddler&#x27;s skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Works for my daughters who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter loves this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> bath stuff for his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My son had had eczema since he was 6 months old.</li>
            <li> I use it on my sensitive skin and on my toddler&#x27;s eczema-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> So far, this soap seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> if only they had seen it with her dry, scaly, eczema breakouts to see the true difference.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but worth it for us!</li>
            <li> This was the only lotion that helped clear up the eczema on my hands!!</li>
            <li> My 9 month old has very sensitive skin, especially under his chin and on his neck.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I have used on my son since he developed eczema at 4 months old.</li>
            <li> I suffer from blepharitis and dry eyes, I had tried using other baby shampoos (Johnsons and California Baby), special washes and scrubs per my doctors</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of different lotions to clear it up and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> My daughter is almost 3 years old now and has only had 2 flare ups from eczema, which I had to use a cream prescribed by her pediatrician.</li>
            <li> The reason why I&#x27;m saying that it works so far is that this soap along with different types of moisturizing creams (not the product by itself) have shown an improvement on her skin.  </li>
            <li> after the first couple of uses, I started to see marked improvements, until it all went away after only a few weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li> Her skin is not dry after bath with this.</li>
            <li> but, if your skin is very sensitive and dry, this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> As a frequent hand washer (no, I&#x27;m not ODD), my hands itch and look rough and red.</li>
            <li> Her skin is dry and sensitive and it is the only product that works for her.</li>
            <li> My 2 month old had very dry, flaky skin</li>
            <li> It has very little smell which I really like.  </li>
            <li> So we went back to Mustela, and immediately, his dry skin was gone.  </li>
            <li> As the weather became cooler and dryer we noticed she began to have eczema (dry patches on her back, elbows, and legs)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant to buy a product that wasn&#x27;t 100% organic with all natural ingredients, however, I went down a long road before I came to this one</li>
            <li> Helped a bit, but stopped working after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;Third, I went all natural and bought Badger Baby Balm, Badger Oil and Babo Miracle Cream.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gonna feel the same as the other gels with soap, because this is soapless</li>
            <li> We tried other brand of cleansers like Aveeno or Burt&#x27;s Bee for our son, and he ends up with dry patches of skin all over, especially during winter.  </li>
            <li> It does the work, but it makes my daughter&#x27;s skin dry.  </li>
            <li> I plan to order additional product to place by my household sinks to use as hand cleanser.  </li>
            <li> baby (under age 1) has had dry skin with red patches on her ears, legs, under her elbows, knees, and anywhere drool is left behind.</li>
            <li> She does not use any other creams, prescribed or OTC.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t believe the other reviewers, but after JUST ONE BATH we saw an improvement!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Welleda being the other)</li>
            <li> I recommend this to every parent with a little one suffering from severe dry skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from extremely dry skin with our harsh Western New York winters.</li>
            <li> She does have eczema, but once we started using this soap and the lotion and milky bath oil, everything calmed down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural (and equally expensive) products but</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a face cleanser that didn&#x27;t dry me out around my mouth and nose.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected and was less expensive than our local drug store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(4) Mustela Moisturizing Cream after the bath and everyday all over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans well, no scent left behind.</li>
            <li> I follow up with a few drops of emu oil as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> , we&#x27;ve had no more eczema flare ups.</li>
            <li> Gone was the angry red rash</li>
            <li> My 10mo old suffers from eczema</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews, but I just had to because...</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I had cracks in the creases of my skin and would be embarrassed to show my hands in public (yes, seriously).</li>
            <li> After a nasty bout of infantile eczema and several sleepless nights, she responded well to our regimen of Hydrocortizone Cream 1% (used only for 3 days), Mustela Stelatopia Cream Cleanser, Mustela Stelatopia Milky Bath Oil, Vanicream Moisturizing Cream and Vanicream Lite Lotion.</li>
            <li> Not good for baby hair though</li>
            <li> This cleared him up within a weak.  </li>
            <li> and so I was searching for a soap that wouldn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li> My 6 month old son had horrible eczema on his face.</li>
            <li> Grandson had a BAD, BAD case of eczema.  </li>
            <li> My daughter had bad eczema as an infant, and a friend recommended this and it has worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has really bad eczema on her thighs.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a really bad cradle cap and eczema and this was a dream!</li>
            <li> My son has terrible eczema and cannot use any soaps with fragrance or irritants.</li>
            <li> Use this for both of my babies, who had terrible eczema.  </li>
            <li> Went to pedi with 6wo with awful rash, she recommended this along with moisturizer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive hands, history of eczema and contact dermatitis. I find this formula superior to other products I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t strip moisture like most of the cleansers for sensitive skin still seem to do.</li>
            <li> We use this cleanser for our grandson who has eczema.  This product is very gentle and cleans well.  Highly recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have use this cleanser for my son since his birth from Jan.2011.  I found this cleanser is very easy to wash off which is especially good in winter season.</li>
            <li> We have been using Mustela&#x27;s Stelatopia line for our daughter for almost 5 years now.  This is the only product that keeps her skin calm and moisturized.  She does have eczema, but once we started using this soap and the lotion and milky bath oil, everything calmed down.  She does not use any other creams, prescribed or OTC.  This is by far the BEST product out there, and I tell everyone I meet that has a child with dry skin.  Like I said, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 5 years now and I will never switch products.</li>
            <li> i feel it is not chemical and my baby is safe with this product.</li>
            <li> It is working very well for our 6 month old son. Highly recommend the Mustela brand and this cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews, but I just had to because... This moisturizing cream is THE BEST of both worlds - sinks in better than a typical LOTION, but doesn&#x27;t leave as much sticky residue as an OIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My baby (under age 1) has had dry skin with red patches on her ears, legs, under her elbows, knees, and anywhere drool is left behind. She was constantly itchy and scratched herself to the point of bleeding sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy a product that wasn&#x27;t 100% organic with all natural ingredients, however, I went down a long road before I came to this one and I want to save you the time and energy I wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I tried Honest Company&#x27;s bath wash and lotion. Fail.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I tried a combination of Honest Company&#x27;s bath wash, Vanicream and Aquaphor. Helped a bit, but stopped working after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;Third, I went all natural and bought Badger Baby Balm, Badger Oil and Babo Miracle Cream. (Badger is mostly olive oil.) I really wanted to love all three products, esp. the Babo but I agreed with the reviewers that said the smell turned them off. I would have stuck with them if they had worked because I love the ingredients and EWG (Environmental Working Group) ratings, but they just did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I bought Mustela&#x27;s Cream Wash and Moisturizing Cream!!!&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I also bought Aveeno Baby Eczema Therapy Bath (oatmeal bath packets).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hers is my winning combination:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Mustela Cream Wash in separate tub/sink&lt;br /&gt;(2) Aveeno oatmeal bath in her baby tub&lt;br /&gt;(3) Angel Baby Oil (from Earth Mama Angel Baby, just for an added all natural element, to get the calendula in there, and to help her scalp. It contains: grape seed oil, jojoba oil, and organic calendula)&lt;br /&gt;(4) Mustela Moisturizing Cream after the bath and everyday all over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t believe the other reviewers, but after JUST ONE BATH we saw an improvement!&lt;br /&gt;It has been 3 days now and her red patches are almost all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make my mistake in thinking all natural is always the best. I realized sometimes we need medications and those are synthetic. My baby&#x27;s skin was so sensitive she needed &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; for it and Mustela worked for her!! I&#x27;ve been agonizing for 10 months...Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make my mistake in thinking all natural is always the best. I realized sometimes we need medications and those are synthetic. My baby&#x27;s skin was so sensitive she needed &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; for it and Mustela worked for her!!

            <li> As a mother I wash my hands frequently and as a result my eczema would flare up on my hands. It was so bad that I had cracks in the creases of my skin and would be embarrassed to show my hands in public (yes, seriously). But once I started using the Mustela Stelatopia Cream Cleanser I noticed that I wouldn&#x27;t need to moisturize as often as a I used to. I really believe that this product, along with a change in my diet, cleared up the eczema on my hands that I had been struggling with for years. I rarely review products on Amazon but felt like this amazing product garnered a positive review so that more people with similar skin problems will try it. I&#x27;ve also started to use this stuff as a face wash and am hoping it will have the same amazing results there!</li>
            <li> Love this whole skin line! It doesn&#x27;t have the wonderful Mustella fragrance so I bought the Musti cologne and now my daughter smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Best eczema brand I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve had eczema my whole life, so I&#x27;ve tried everything from Eucerin to my own home made stuff. This brand by far helps the most!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my daughters extream dry skin</li>
            <li> The stuff does really help to control/contain ezcema (outbreaks) though it&#x27;s pricey.  Have been looking for suitable alternatives and have since been alternating with Aveeno Baby Cleansing Therapy.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product for my newborn&#x27;s eczema prone skin. It worked wonders for him and it was soon after I decided to try it for myself. I had a hard time finding a face cleanser that didn&#x27;t dry me out around my mouth and nose. This was a life saver. It gently removes make up and oil and leaves my face smooth and clean without feeling tight. It has a light lather but rinses clean easily. I am forever a Mustela Stelatopia customer because of this versatile cleanser.</li>
            <li> My 6 month old son had horrible eczema on his face. I tried all kinds of different lotions to clear it up and nothing seemed to work. A friend suggested switching his shampoo/soap to something fragrance free, and after looking at amazon reviews for a few different products, this seemed to fit the bill. I use it for his shampoo and soap and it&#x27;d worked wonderfully especially paired with Vanicream moisturizer, we&#x27;ve had no more eczema flare ups.</li>
            <li> Very good product, excellent 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> Wow. I have tried so many products for my eczema-prone skin, none of which worked. I would always have a reaction, but not with Stelotopia. It doesn&#x27;t strip the lipids and I am not allergic to any of the ingredients. My hands feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It does the work, but it makes my daughter&#x27;s skin dry.  I had tried mustela before but not the stelatopia line, although it is supposedly for sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t really work like it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to agree with the person who said this product was not for sensitive skin. My son has super sensitive skin, and this cleanser actually worsened his condition, so I&#x27;m going to return this. This product may work for others, but after seeing what it does to my son&#x27;s face, I have to give this a one star rating.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! The only thing I have used on my son since he developed eczema at 4 months old. It is a little pricey but worth it for us!</li>
            <li> This cream cleanser is gentle and makes your skin feel soft  and helps with any type of rash. Just a tiny bit will cover you body. The products from this company are all excellent. I searched for years for products I would not be allergic too . You will be happy with it !</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser..keeps my toddler&#x27;s skin soft and hydrated.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected and was less expensive than our local drug store.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I&#x27;ve trusted since my daughter was first born. Now that she&#x27;s a bit older I use cetaphil formulated for eczema because it&#x27;s safe on babies 3 months and up. My daughter is almost 3 years old now and has only had 2 flare ups from eczema, which I had to use a cream prescribed by her pediatrician.</li>
            <li> As a frequent hand washer (no, I&#x27;m not ODD), my hands itch and look rough and red. I started out just using this on my hands and ordered a second bottle for the shower. Very mild. My skin has improved.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and did as a baby so I wasn&#x27;t taking any chances. I actually brought this to the hospital with me and requested that the nurse bath our baby boy using this and the milky bath oil by the same company rather than the standard J&amp;J stuff. So glad I did because as predicted our precious guy has sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Works for my daughters who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and I&#x27;ve tried every cleanser known to man. I find this to work the best for his skin, I use it daily and it seems to help a bit. I the Mustela Stelatopia Milky Bath as well when he has a flare up or when his skin is getting irritated.</li>
            <li> The only wash I&#x27;m going to use for my LO from now on... After a nasty bout of infantile eczema and several sleepless nights, she responded well to our regimen of Hydrocortizone Cream 1% (used only for 3 days), Mustela Stelatopia Cream Cleanser, Mustela Stelatopia Milky Bath Oil, Vanicream Moisturizing Cream and Vanicream Lite Lotion. A month has passed and we haven&#x27;t encountered any recurrence. Best products for babies and grown-ups too!!</li>
            <li> My 2 month old had very dry, flaky skin I tried everything and nothing worked until I found this product. It&#x27;s worth every penny. In combination with the milky bath oil my baby&#x27;s skin showed signs of improvement within 2 days. I recommend this to every parent with a little one suffering from severe dry skin. It is very gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to alleviate my son&#x27;s cradle cap...after the first couple of uses, I started to see marked improvements, until it all went away after only a few weeks of using it.  I would this product to anyone, in fact I have already recommended for use on my godson.  I&#x27;m a happy customer!!!</li>
            <li> My sons akin broke out</li>
            <li> This was the only lotion that helped clear up the eczema on my hands!!</li>
            <li> I am using this product for two years for my daughter I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter loves this cleanser.  Her skin is dry and sensitive and it is the only product that works for her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gonna feel the same as the other gels with soap, because this is soapless but, if your skin is very sensitive and dry, this product is for you.  You have to use some kind of oil after the shower if your skin has problems with dryness.  I bought this as a gift and they say is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried once on the shower and for me was not the right one but, everybody needs are different</li>
            <li> My son has terrible eczema and cannot use any soaps with fragrance or irritants. This creamy wash is perfect for his sensitive skin. We have been using for 2 years now and his eczema has been so much better thanks to this product. We even wash his hair with it. Works great!</li>
            <li> I am using this product as my daily shower cleanser for severe eczema.  Since initiating its use, and in conjunction with the Mustela lipid replacement lotion, my eczema is GONE and I am off prescription steroid cream for the first time in years!  Please note this cleansing cream does not lather, so don&#x27;t expect it to act like soap.  It does however rinse well.  The cleansing &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; takes some getting use to - but it is soooo worth it!  I do use the Mustela lotion after my shower &amp; before bed (per recommendations).  I highly recommend these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who has suffered for years &amp; tried every product on the market, I am very thankful I found this product!  I plan to order additional product to place by my household sinks to use as hand cleanser.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Great for eczema, gentle and no fragrance</li>
            <li> This is the greatest miracle ever for sensitive, irritated skin or cradle cap, you can use as a body wash and shampoo.  Excellent moisturizing affect, clears skin right up.  Pure, lovely and light!  Love, love, love it!  Lasts for a good long while too!</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money.  My daughter had baby eczema, every cleanser would just dry her skin even more.  Mustela products have been the only effective creams, cleansers, and shampoos.  I love their products.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> Grandson had a BAD, BAD case of eczema.  we threw out ALL the J&amp;J baby shampoo and bath wash and scented anything.  This cleared him up within a weak.  We will never go back to the &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; bath stuff for his sensitive skin.  TOTALLY worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The best product on the market for mixed baby skin we have no problem since using this product, we would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help with eczema</li>
            <li> My son had had eczema since he was 6 months old. This is the only soap that works and does not cause a flare up. Love this stuff. I am a huge stelatopia fan. The oil works as well during a flare up.</li>
            <li> Love it and have been using it for 4 years on my daughter to keep her dermatitis under control.  I&#x27;ve tried other natural (and equally expensive) products but the Stelatopia cream cleanser by Mustela is the most reliable and consistent!  I would happily be their spokeswoman!</li>
            <li> I bought the whole Mustela arsenal of milk oil, soap and lotion. Gentle cleanser. Helps my toddlers skin immediately and leaves it looking amazingly healthy. As in people compliment her beautiful skin...if only they had seen it with her dry, scaly, eczema breakouts to see the true difference.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a really bad cradle cap and eczema and this was a dream! It helps clear things up within days. We also purchased a cradle cap brush and the combination was wonderful!</li>
            <li> The only thing that has helped my daughter&#x27;s &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;. Cleans well, no scent left behind. Not good for baby hair though</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I use it on my sensitive skin and on my toddler&#x27;s eczema-prone skin.  It builds a nice lather, cleans well (even cleans waterproof makeup), and leaves skin soft.  Rated 5/5 by National Eczema Association, contains no known irritants.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Use this for both of my babies, who had terrible eczema.  Does a great job with gentle cleaning and works well with their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best wash for a baby (or any human) with dry, itchy, eczema prone skin! It&#x27;s unscented, makes an amazing lather and leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft, not dry like some other &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; soaps. I have gotten one for myself and use it during the winter to combat the dried out winter skin I get on my own face!</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin and Mustela is 1 out o 2 brands (Welleda being the other) that can actually prevent eczema from occurring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old, and I love this product! It cleanses thoroughly without drying your skin.  A lot of cleansers strip your skin, causing it to produce more oil and resulting in acne. I rarely break out using this product, and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use around the eyes.  I suffer from blepharitis and dry eyes, I had tried using other baby shampoos (Johnsons and California Baby), special washes and scrubs per my doctors suggestion to no avail. This is the only product that has worked. Stelatopia has been a godsend for me!  I follow up with a few drops of emu oil as a moisturizer.  I also use this as a shampoo and it works great!</li>
            <li> We tried other brand of cleansers like Aveeno or Burt&#x27;s Bee for our son, and he ends up with dry patches of skin all over, especially during winter.  So we went back to Mustela, and immediately, his dry skin was gone.  What can we say, it works, but we just need to pay more for it but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> So far, this soap seems to be working.  We started bathing our daughter using the mustela 2 in 1 soap and things were going well with it until she developed a mild case of eczema.  The reason why I&#x27;m saying that it works so far is that this soap along with different types of moisturizing creams (not the product by itself) have shown an improvement on her skin.  There is no unpleasant \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; smell to it, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> My daughter had bad eczema as an infant, and a friend recommended this and it has worked wonders. Her skin is not dry after bath with this. We use it for washing her whole body, and she is now 2.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best baby wash for sensitive and/or eczema-prone skin. Combine with the Lipid Replenishing Balm ... Perfection!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from extremely dry skin with our harsh Western New York winters. I used to buy this product at Target but our local store discontinued it. Without this cleanser, we wouldn&#x27;t make it through the winter without cracked and bleeding skin. Sometimes this is enough to nourish her skin back to health, sometimes I also have to use the Mustela Stelatopia lotion. These products are a LIFE SAVER. I highly recommend. Well worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> not as good as the moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> My newborn&#x27;s excema went away in just days. The affected area would be really red after using, but it cleared everything up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Went to pedi with 6wo with awful rash, she recommended this along with moisturizer. The next morning after using my baby&#x27;s skin looked so much better. Gone was the angry red rash I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results. Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This has been great for my 2 year olds skin after she experienced some sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li> Excellent gentle cream cleanser for people with eczema or other sensitive skin problems-- only product I have found that consistently works for these issues. Designed for babies, but suitable for adults. Good for makeup removal (doesn&#x27;t sting eyes).</li>
            <li> Our daughter has really bad eczema on her thighs. This cleanser and Aveeno Eczema lotion are what keep her legs clear and itch free. We noticed improvement very quickly and could see the difference if we ever stopped using it</li>
            <li> Great product. My 9 month old has very sensitive skin, especially under his chin and on his neck.  We tried lots of different cleansers that didnt work. With in a day or two of using this his skin was so much better.  He stopped pulling at his skin which finally allowed his skin to heal.  It has very little smell which I really like.  We use this on his whole body and his hair and seem to clean his hair just fine.  He doesnt have a whole lot of hair which maybe that would make a difference as to how it works on hair.</li>
            <li> We love Mustela baby products and has only used this brand for our daughter. As the weather became cooler and dryer we noticed she began to have eczema (dry patches on her back, elbows, and legs) so we decided to try Mustela&#x27;s Stelatopia Line. We absolutely love this body cleanser. We use only one full pump of the cleanser and lather it up with a wash cloth. The soap is gentle, has no fragrant, and easily rinses off without drying out her skin. We&#x27;re pleased with how gentle and moisturizing this cleanser has been so far. We use it daily and will continue to use it during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Mild product that does not dry the skin or leave a film for adults with sensitive skin.  Works great in conjunction with Mustela moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I received 2 Mustela moisturizing creams.&lt;br /&gt;I did not receive Cream Cleansers as I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I needed them by the 14th because I will take them out of the country to my sister.&lt;br /&gt;What am going to do now?</li>
            <li> My 10mo old suffers from eczema and so I was searching for a soap that wouldn&#x27;t make it worse. This stuff is amazing and he hasn&#x27;t had a rash since we&#x27;ve been using it. Love it!</li>
