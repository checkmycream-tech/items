            <li>I decided that my skin deserved better</li>
            <li>and I am glad I made the investment.  </li>
            <li>i wanted  to be able to try them out for a bit w</li>
            <li>Scents are fabulous, as always!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with Aveda skincare.  </li>
            <li>Love  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had pretty good skin but</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great way to try several products, and it&#x27;s nice travel size samples.</li>
            <li>I do like the rose crÃ¨me, but otherwise, I am glad I got the sample pack as I would have been upset if I had paid full price for full size bottles.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i was able to experiment with each for some time to find the one that really complements my skin type and feels amazing on.</li>
            <li>These products not only make you look and feel beautiful,</li>
            <li>They are healthy for your skin, have a pleasant herbal smell, and actually do what they advertise.  </li>
            <li>I love Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Rose Day Cream, so I thought this was a good way to try several products at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizers are fabulous.</li>
            <li>This kit is compact yet powerful!</li>
            <li>I originally purchase this for my Mom on the recommendation of a friend.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked more glowing or felt more soft.</li>
            <li>the biggest thing is their backage ðŸ˜–but the quality of the cream is cool</li>
            <li>I am so taken with the results, I have purchased full sizes of the cleanser, toner, rose moisturizer, regenerating eye cream, regenerating facial serum and translucent foundation.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome way for folks who are curious about Dr. Hauschka to try it without dropping the big bucks on the full-sized products.  </li>
            <li>My mother-in-law tried the same kit and is thrilled also.</li>
            <li>I didnt find it useful at all</li>
            <li>well worth it)</li>
            <li>But it is still worth</li>
            <li>and it wasnt any better than the regular skin care items i have...not worth the money!</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product, but found the face wash left an oily film on my face causing it to not feel clean and to break out.</li>
            <li>The product is pretty nice but different.</li>
            <li>I really like these products!</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought several more, as I am seeing my grown daughters use the products, also.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love the dr hauschka products - the toner especially - it does wonders to tighten those pores!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit if you&#x27;re interested in this line.  </li>
            <li>Another option if you want to try the line but are nervous about spending so much: some retail stores have very generous return policies.</li>
            <li>both so fabulous I had to get them both and alternate between them.</li>
            <li>/out too much of an investment</li>
            <li>Then i HIGHLY recommend this kit!</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t like the quince day cream or have much use for the toner, so for that reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using dr hauschka mascara, concealer &amp; foundation for a while now and have been very curious about their skin care line but wasn&#x27;t sure where to start.</li>
            <li>But i finally found the right one..</li>
            <li>comfortable on the skin, does not cause &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; sensation due to skin tautness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In addition, it has lessened my natural redness.</li>
            <li>I am partial to the rose cream (regular not light) as I live in a semi arid climate.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first round at Whole Foods, and their policy (I believe) is that you can return any cosmetics for any reason within 30 days of purchase so long as you have your receipt.</li>
            <li>it was pretty expensive to buy a full size.  </li>

            <li> This kit includes small amounts of several products, but used properly, you should be able to get at LEAST two weeks out of these samples, if not more.  </li>
            <li> Excuse my colloquialism</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me when I was pregant..to help with my rosacea and dry skin.</li>
            <li> you have dry dehydrated skin and prone to scaring like I am.</li>
            <li> A little of each goes a long way, and definitely see and feel a substantial difference in skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> I have previously used dr haschka &#x27;s facial products and found they suited my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> They are pretty small samples, but it gives you the chance to find out which ones to buy and you won&#x27;t be sorry once you do--excellent natural products!  </li>
            <li> I tried all of the samples and gave them time and studied carefully the reaction of my skin.</li>
            <li> Please consider:  -A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought it after getting hooked so that I could have small, TSA-approved sized versions to bring on a trip in my carry on bag.  </li>
            <li> A lot of money for a mix of small, barely enough to know if you like it, samples.</li>
            <li> do like the sample kit from other sources.</li>

            <li> even just a little of this stuff makes my face look like an angel&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> for instance, the kit includes 3 different moisturizing creams varying in texture from incredibly thin to really thick &amp; creamy.</li>
            <li> the creams are way too small .</li>
            <li> Its not your usual cleanser or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. H for years and when I travel, I like to order this small kit.</li>
            <li> using them is a treat because of the delicate textures and aromas.</li>
            <li> since the products are so expensive (yet</li>
            <li> i wish it wasnt so expensive!</li>
            <li> Even after I washed it off my skin smelled just as bad.</li>

            <li> Excellent product and seller, thanks for the quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> the creams are way too small . the biggest thing is their backage ðŸ˜–but the quality of the cream is cool</li>

I actually bought it after getting hooked so that I could have small, TSA-approved sized versions to bring on a trip in my carry on bag.  Please consider:  -A little bit goes a long way.  This kit includes small amounts of several products, but used properly, you should be able to get at LEAST two weeks out of these samples, if not more.  -As with all cosmetics, it can take a while to see results.  Try to give it a week or two before you decide it&#x27;s not working.  Another option if you want to try the line but are nervous about spending so much: some retail stores have very generous return policies. Call around and ask if they carry Dr. H and what their return policy is.  I bought my first round at Whole Foods, and their policy (I believe) is that you can return any cosmetics for any reason within 30 days of purchase so long as you have your receipt.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit if you&#x27;re interested in this line.  I purchased it because although I&#x27;d read so many good things about Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s line (including that Jennifer Aniston uses the rose face cream) it was pretty expensive to buy a full size.  They are pretty small samples, but it gives you the chance to find out which ones to buy and you won&#x27;t be sorry once you do--excellent natural products!

            <li> A lot of money for a mix of small, barely enough to know if you like it, samples. a LOT of money for this lot.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty nice but different. Its not your usual cleanser or moisturizer. The biggest issue were the moisturizing creams.I tried all of the samples and gave them time and studied carefully the reaction of my skin.But i finally found the right one..(the Rose Day Cream).BY THE WAY SHIPPING WAS GREAT! THANX AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but found the face wash left an oily film on my face causing it to not feel clean and to break out.</li>
            <li> I have previously used dr haschka &#x27;s facial products and found they suited my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable on the skin, does not cause &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; sensation due to skin tautness.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend using it if affordable.</li>
            <li> Try this kit and you will see why everyone raves about these products.  They are healthy for your skin, have a pleasant herbal smell, and actually do what they advertise.  I am partial to the rose cream (regular not light) as I live in a semi arid climate.  My skin still feels refreshed at the end of the day and I can&#x27;t remember any product before this that made me feel that way.  I am over 50.  I am so taken with the results, I have purchased full sizes of the cleanser, toner, rose moisturizer, regenerating eye cream, regenerating facial serum and translucent foundation.  Ladies...it is time to stop smearing your face with chemicals and harmful ingredients.  I decided that my skin deserved better and I am glad I made the investment.  You will be too!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using dr hauschka mascara, concealer &amp; foundation for a while now and have been very curious about their skin care line but wasn&#x27;t sure where to start. since the products are so expensive (yet well worth it) i wanted  to be able to try them out for a bit w/out too much of an investment so i went with this sampler tin. i am incredibly happy with the products and also incredibly happy that i was able to pinpoint which products i really wanted to buy more of through this sampler. for instance, the kit includes 3 different moisturizing creams varying in texture from incredibly thin to really thick &amp; creamy. i&#x27;m glad i was able to experiment with each for some time to find the one that really complements my skin type and feels amazing on. i absolutely love the dr hauschka products - the toner especially - it does wonders to tighten those pores! and, the cleansing milk is about the most luxurious way to take off make-up and wash your face in the morning EVER! amazing to think it&#x27;s non-toxic to boot!</li>
            <li> Scents are fabulous, as always!  A little of each goes a long way, and definitely see and feel a substantial difference in skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!! After my terrible experience with the Desert Essence Tea Tree Facewash. This kit helped bring back life to my skin. Also tamed all of my breakouts. I went ahead and reordered. I do wish the tubes were bigger. But it is still worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry dehydrated skin and prone to scaring like I am. Then i HIGHLY recommend this kit! GET IT! (:</li>
            <li> Excuse my colloquialism but I can&#x27;t even with this s***. It&#x27;s magic. I&#x27;ve always had pretty good skin but even just a little of this stuff makes my face look like an angel&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing and i loved immediately! it smells incredible, my skin is vital and the results are radiant!! i wish it wasnt so expensive!</li>
            <li> All of the items in this set smell awful except the Quince cream. The rest of them smell rancid or slightly rotten. The cleansing cream smelled like yeast. Even after I washed it off my skin smelled just as bad.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Rose Day Cream, so I thought this was a good way to try several products at a reasonable price.  For that it deserves 5 stars.  However, I didn&#x27;t like the quince day cream or have much use for the toner, so for that reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.  But it&#x27;s a great way to try several products, and it&#x27;s nice travel size samples.</li>
            <li> Loved this sample kit! The moisturizers are fabulous. I would highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This package was already opened ... one item had been used, i threw it away...&lt;br /&gt;I do like the sample kit from other sources.</li>
            <li> See review for Dr. Hauschka revitalizing kit. Great products.</li>
            <li> I do like the rose crÃ¨me, but otherwise, I am glad I got the sample pack as I would have been upset if I had paid full price for full size bottles.</li>
            <li> I originally purchase this for my Mom on the recommendation of a friend. She specifically recommended the Rose Day Cream, but this kit seemed like an affordable way to try a variety of Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products. My Mom loved it, and then I purchased the kit for myself as well. These products not only make you look and feel beautiful, using them is a treat because of the delicate textures and aromas. My skin has never looked more glowing or felt more soft. In addition, it has lessened my natural redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. H for years and when I travel, I like to order this small kit. It always arrives very quickly and the products itself are wonderful!</li>
            <li> It was a nice kit...good sample sizes.  I didn&#x27;t care for the cleanser or the lotions/creams.  Wasn&#x27;t happy with the line.  I have fallen in love with Aveda skincare.  However, this may work for someone else.  It is a good size travel kit for sure if you love the products.</li>
            <li> Love  this kit a great way to try before you buy&lt;br /&gt;seller delivered before time</li>
            <li> I love Dr Hauschka Kit because it&#x27;s a great oportunity to test 6 different Dr Haushcka products for DRY SKIN and choose which ones are best for my face&#x27;s needs, love it !!</li>
