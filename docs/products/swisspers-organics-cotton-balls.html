            <li>A million times better than CVS brand ones.</li>
            <li>And with the amount...  you probably are ok for like a year</li>
            <li>What more could one want?</li>
            <li>And, of course, everything is better organic.</li>
            <li>Top quality non GMO cotton balls.</li>
            <li>You can not find anything better than that.</li>
            <li>Love these cotton balls, love that they&#x27;re organic.</li>
            <li>These keep their individual shape and are the perfect size for makeup remover and toner.</li>

            <li>I am able to sleep without worry knowing I picked these balls up.</li>
            <li>So for this review I have to say I love the product.</li>
            <li>I can sincerely taste the difference in</li>
            <li>Better price on another site.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see how much better these are.</li>
            <li>Nice clean product.</li>
            <li>They are soft and happy to say they are organic.</li>
            <li>I figured organic would be best for the plants (keep those other chemicals away).  </li>
            <li>Product is fine.  </li>
            <li>, I like these thinner ones better because they are easier to roll into a wick instead of having to tear them into the perfect diameter, and they&#x27;re still super fluffy.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely fantastic for building wicks on atomizers.</li>
            <li>As an added plus, they are organic and thoughtfully packaged.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for the price, and go the job done.  </li>
            <li>Are fantastic quality and just what we were seeking.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but using one ball per day, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Packaging was sufficient and clean and delivery on-time.  </li>
            <li>and I have to use four of them squished together to clean out my dogs ears.  </li>
            <li>These cotton balls are nicely oversized and soft.</li>
            <li>Nice soft cottonballs</li>
            <li>These are nice and soft and I like knowing that their organic</li>
            <li>I would purchase these again especially since they are organic and are better to use:)</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and are packed in three separate bags with resealable tops, which is convenient.</li>
            <li>All of the cotton is very consistent.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth and soft and when I use them after applying lotion to my face -</li>
            <li>Nice and soft and very absorbent.</li>
            <li>I think these are definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>With cotton balls I want to use near my eyes and those I love, I would recommend them.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and hold their shape, so I want to buy more to use on my face.  </li>
            <li>These cotton balls are nicely sized and pretty and white.  </li>
            <li>Soft and easy to tear apart.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>These cotton balls are really soft smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>and you get so many of them they are probably going to last me a year.</li>
            <li>These are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>good, soft, as expected.</li>
            <li>I could immediately tell the difference between these amazing ones and previous cotton balls I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Loved the 3 pack deal because this will last me a long time!</li>
            <li>Enough organic cotton for wicking to last me a whole year or more !</li>
            <li>Very soft!!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast thanks to Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>I used these before, and really like the way they hold a liquid.</li>
            <li>They are the absolutely softest cotton balls I have ever touched.  </li>
            <li>so much for ORGANIC when it was treated with those chemicals.</li>
            <li>They do their job very well</li>
            <li>Very soft and gentle on eyes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just normal size.</li>
            <li>Very soft and my baby loves it.</li>
            <li>I mean once you unwind them, they are just as thick, they are just rolled around into a ball more times, this works better!</li>
            <li>Wow these cotton balls are SOFT!!</li>
            <li>Small bag with zip top closure, puffy and soft.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred an all natural cotton.</li>
            <li>With lots of skin issues (eczema) including eye itchiness, this is a winner for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(Yeah, I just can&#x27;t stop wearing my &amp;#34;made for sensitive skin&amp;#34; eye make-up.)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; no problem.</li>
            <li>I found these cotton balls to be both soft and substantial.  </li>
            <li>I use them with a facial toner and, even though they are so gentle, they still get those last bits of dirt and debris off your face and neck without pulling, tugging, or damage.</li>
            <li>The description says that the product is organic but it is clearly printed in the back that it is bleached with hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>While they are extremely soft, they tend to fall apart very easily, especially when exposed to any liquids.</li>
            <li>I use them frequently to clean my newborn&#x27;s delicate face.</li>
            <li>Seems a little funny to do a cottonball review, but I use cottonballs with toner on my face twice a day and wanted organic cotton.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t now cottonballs enough to tell whether these are good or bad.</li>

            <li> These organic cotton balls are gentle on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Does not feel like the ordinary cotton balls you might normally buy.</li>
            <li> long as it stays legitimately organic.</li>
            <li> ridiculously soft - i was skeptical on how soft these would actually be based on some of the reviews raving about these cotton balls, but once you use them on your face</li>
            <li> Wayyy less quantity than I was expecting, because they&#x27;re so tiny!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually quite shocking how soft they really are compared to the basic ones you&#x27;d normally buy.</li>
            <li> I use cotton balls to remove my eye makeup and although I like the softness of these cotton balls, I would have preferred them to be a little larger in size.</li>
            <li> so there obviously aren&#x27;t any hard chemicals or contaminants to worry about within the material</li>
            <li> Have no off flavor, and while they are less thick then other organic cotton balls I have received</li>
            <li> Works well for atomizer and rba wicks, of course after boiling a few times to remove the hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> When I say less thick</li>
            <li> Woudn&#x27;t go back to store brand fake cotton dyed ones.</li>
            <li> I usually buy whatever cotton ball is at the pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> They are a little small, but that just means I had to thin them out less for wicking.</li>
            <li> Very fluffy.</li>
            <li> These bags are very small.  </li>
            <li> so no fear of weird chemicals or dyes.  </li>
            <li> Does not have any bad taste or scratches to the throat when used as wick for an E-Cigarette.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I use cotton balls to remove my eye makeup and although I like the softness of these cotton balls, I would have preferred them to be a little larger in size.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely fantastic for building wicks on atomizers. One bag of this stuff is going to last me until the end of time, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife got the benefit of getting the extra bag I realized I didn&#x27;t need, and she loves them for all of her stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;m using the cotton as wicking material for vaping, or e-cigarette.  All of the cotton is very consistent.  Packaging was sufficient and clean and delivery on-time.  10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> Research &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Cotton&amp;#34; balls.</li>
            <li> I used these before, and really like the way they hold a liquid. I use them for nail polish remover and makeup remover and I feel they last longer using cotton balls. And, of course, everything is better organic.</li>
            <li> Nice soft cottonballs</li>
            <li> Very soft!! Highly recommend. I would purchase these again especially since they are organic and are better to use:) thanks!</li>
            <li> ridiculously soft - i was skeptical on how soft these would actually be based on some of the reviews raving about these cotton balls, but once you use them on your face it&#x27;s actually quite shocking how soft they really are compared to the basic ones you&#x27;d normally buy. will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> While they are extremely soft, they tend to fall apart very easily, especially when exposed to any liquids. If you&#x27;re looking for a good facial cotton, this is not your best bet.</li>
            <li> These organic cotton balls are gentle on delicate skin. I use them frequently to clean my newborn&#x27;s delicate face.</li>
            <li> Top quality non GMO cotton balls. You can not find anything better than that.</li>
            <li> The organic balls are the perfect size and texture for my purposes. They arrived quickly and are packed in three separate bags with resealable tops, which is convenient. Good buy.</li>
            <li> no boiling required! these are the best for rebuildable atomizers, give the cleanest taste and fluffiest vapor! plus will last you forever!</li>
            <li> Use this on my cats.  Very soft and gentle on eyes.</li>
            <li> The description says that the product is organic but it is clearly printed in the back that it is bleached with hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> These are nice and soft and I like knowing that their organic</li>
            <li> good, soft, as expected.</li>
            <li> Love these cotton balls, love that they&#x27;re organic. Getting four starts because I wish the manufacturer would actually make &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; sized cotton balls. These are not jumbo, even though they&#x27;re labeled as such. They&#x27;re just normal size.</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering cotton balls online because some brands tend to mesh together and shed a lot. These keep their individual shape and are the perfect size for makeup remover and toner. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> They are the absolutely softest cotton balls I have ever touched.  As an added plus, they are organic and thoughtfully packaged.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred an all natural cotton. not cotton bleached, or whitened with hydrogen peroxide. so much for ORGANIC when it was treated with those chemicals.</li>
            <li> If you are using a rebuildable dripping atomizer, these cotton balls are perfect, just don&#x27;t forget to boil them they have hydrogen peroxide in them!</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but using one ball per day, it&#x27;s worth it! Gentle for everyday eye make-up removal. With lots of skin issues (eczema) including eye itchiness, this is a winner for my sensitive skin. (Yeah, I just can&#x27;t stop wearing my &amp;#34;made for sensitive skin&amp;#34; eye make-up.) Small bag with zip top closure, puffy and soft. Came in a bag of three bags of 80. I&#x27;d recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> These cotton balls are great. Does not feel like the ordinary cotton balls you might normally buy. It does have a different feel and does the job. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Seems a little funny to do a cottonball review, but I use cottonballs with toner on my face twice a day and wanted organic cotton.  Love these!</li>
            <li> These cotton balls are really soft smooth and silky. Love them. Woudn&#x27;t go back to store brand fake cotton dyed ones. Really great product and worth waiting for. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this since all the CVS locally are always out of stock.  I think these are definitely worth it.  Soft and easy to tear apart.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for the price, and go the job done.  I used these cotton balls for removing eye makeup and applying skin toner.</li>
            <li> Wow these cotton balls are SOFT!! I could immediately tell the difference between these amazing ones and previous cotton balls I&#x27;ve used. I use them with a facial toner and, even though they are so gentle, they still get those last bits of dirt and debris off your face and neck without pulling, tugging, or damage. I will be continuing to buy these again and again.</li>
            <li> Got these for wicking my coils to vape with, they work amazingly well and you get so many of them they are probably going to last me a year. Well except for the fact that I&#x27;ve also started using them for cleaning and makeup applications and removal.</li>
            <li> These cotton balls are astoundingly amazing.  What a deal!  I am able to sleep without worry knowing I picked these balls up.</li>
            <li> So for this review I have to say I love the product. As I am a man&lt;br /&gt;do not use this for make up and that jazz I solely bought it to use for&lt;br /&gt;my rebuildable atomizer. I can sincerely taste the difference in&lt;br /&gt;my flavors by using the organic as opposed to the stuff from&lt;br /&gt;WalMart. Keep it up guys I will continue to buy this product&lt;br /&gt;as long as it stays legitimately organic.</li>
            <li> Works well for atomizer and rba wicks, of course after boiling a few times to remove the hydrogen peroxide. Bought the 3 pack, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll run out anytime soon.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as described. Not too dense, not too springy.  Nice medium size to fit in hand nicely. There&#x27;s no adjustment needed for me, just use &amp; go. I have sensitive skin &amp; no problem.</li>
            <li> They are a little small, but that just means I had to thin them out less for wicking. All in all, good cotton balls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t now cottonballs enough to tell whether these are good or bad. I use them to wipe off makeup and it works.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these cotton balls. They are soft and happy to say they are organic. They do their job very well and I will order these cotton balls again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for wicking material in my micro coils after watching a YouTube video. It works / tastes great and is such a great value!</li>
            <li> Are fantastic quality and just what we were seeking.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product. Very soft and my baby loves it.</li>
            <li> I found these cotton balls to be both soft and substantial.  I actually looked up the &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; of organic cotton.  With cotton balls I want to use near my eyes and those I love, I would recommend them.  The packaging is a plus with separate zip-locked bags.</li>
            <li> Product is fine.  I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to the quantity.  I was thinking it was 240 balls per bag.  These bags are very small.  Better price on another site.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for a preschool bean growing project.  I figured organic would be best for the plants (keep those other chemicals away).  They are soft and hold their shape, so I want to buy more to use on my face.  I usually buy whatever cotton ball is at the pharmacy.  I use one a day on my acne prone face.  I&#x27;d love to see how much better these are.</li>
            <li> They work well, though I would have preferred a larger cotton ball.  These are rather tiny and I have to use four of them squished together to clean out my dogs ears.  I do appreciate an organic option that isn&#x27;t laden with chemicals.</li>
            <li> Every time I use these I think - these have to be the best cotton balls ever.  Very smooth and soft and when I use them after applying lotion to my face - I don&#x27;t end up with fuzz balls stuck and tickling my entire face.</li>
