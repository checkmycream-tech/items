            <li>fresh smell...love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this still smells like the original stuff I had before it.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s not a scam--the original company just delegated it out.</li>
            <li>Not so sure its the real thing though!</li>
            <li>Got it for a friend for his birthday and was so excited.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pleasing scent...not too strong!</li>
            <li>Always presents a clean and woderful aroma.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong, just right.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells great and is stronger than the other curve colognes that are available for a lower price here on amazon.</li>
            <li>Only compliant would be dented nearly crushed top on bottle though in perfect working condition  I spray and smell aaaaaamaaaaazingggg!</li>
            <li>But, it smells good and brings back memories.</li>
            <li>and this was the most reasonable.</li>
            <li>But I just love it so much.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really a gift for me :)</li>
            <li>I have had several people comment on how good it smells.  </li>
            <li>It has a sensual and sweet aromatic smell.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s such a good cologne</li>
            <li>I have been using Curve for at least 20 years and it&#x27;s one of the best products I have used.  </li>
            <li>Good price for a big bottle of it.</li>
            <li>I notice the scent is not as strong as the original and fades much sooner.</li>
            <li>It has a clean and fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
            <li>Lucky.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery...</li>
            <li>Two quick sprays to either side of my shirt</li>
            <li>Not only do I love this scent (&amp; it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite, too)</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted and at a fabulous price.  </li>
            <li>orders always arrive very quickly, and very well</li>
            <li>Therefore, when I found it on Amazon I immediately purchased it and glad I did exactly what I wanted and Thanks.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li>In the bottle the name of \\&quot;curve\\&quot; was a sticker that was put crooked and almost peeling on both bottles lmao...</li>
            <li>/&gt;NOT WORTH $25....</li>
            <li>It does really smell good, but just does not go the extra mile.</li>
            <li>My 18yr old sons favorite scent</li>
            <li>and it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>And now even my kids are following in my footsteps after lots of occasions of coughing them spraying my own.</li>
            <li>Finally thought it was time to get them their own....</li>
            <li>hope amazon wont encourage this kind of generic products.</li>
            <li>the price  was worth it.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift and it was not a disappointment</li>
            <li>Not the best smelling, but for a low price it is not bad compared to paying $100+ for much less volume of name brands nowadays.</li>
            <li>Great cologne, not strong, husband loves it</li>
            <li>really customer friendly refunded me the  </li>
            <li>No matter how long it&#x27;s been around, Curve will always be my favorite!</li>
            <li>I was fortunate that the item was not broken, however, it was pretty &#x27;banged&#x27; up from rolling around against the tin.</li>
            <li>Not to strong but very masculine.</li>
            <li>It is a light scent, but strong enough for people to notice.</li>
            <li>This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>A classic cologne never fails, long lasting cologne the best!</li>
            <li>and as always, the price is right ;)</li>
            <li>Mixed with Old Spice deodarant and you be smelling good.</li>
            <li>It shipped very fast and was at my door in no time.</li>
            <li>My favorite for ten years or so now!</li>
            <li>Of the hundreds of items I have purchased from Amazon this is the first I have attempted to return.</li>
            <li>Like the cologne and better buy than at the local department stores!</li>
            <li>this isnt it , lost scent fast!</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>I used to spray some of this on when it first came out when I was kid.</li>
            <li>;-).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and wanted.</li>
            <li>Fabulous men&#x27;s classy smell.</li>
            <li>Much better than the local stores and malls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my husband loves it too ;)</li>
            <li>I will most definately go through Amazon for future purchases.</li>
            <li>was fast!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves this scent!</li>
            <li>interestingly, the perfume even though looks identical to those from big-box retailers smells different.</li>
            <li>first off......</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have been using this scent since it first came out.</li>
            <li>(so does everyone else ;).</li>
            <li>Beyond that it says it&#x27;s made in USA and distributed by &amp;#34;EA Fragrances Co.&amp;#34; in NYC, which evidently also has a basis in London.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing curve since 1999 (this exact type).</li>
            <li>thanks again guys!</li>
            <li>The first time I bought Curve was about 12or 14 years ago.</li>
            <li>Will more than likely where it for another 5+ and beyond.</li>
            <li>First of all the word curve is stuck in the bottle like a label.</li>
            <li>After using the bottle of Curve I received from Amazon for the first time this morning, I am absolutely mortified!</li>
            <li>It has become my signature since my then girlfriend (now wife) gifted it to me 13 years back.</li>
            <li>Curve has a strong, yet very tolerable masculine smell.</li>
            <li>I was initially quite upset but Amazon made it right by giving me a full refund AND the item!</li>
            <li>but for 12-15$ I will be the original next time unless I need this for myself when I get out the gym for a quick spray</li>
            <li>The first couple bottles went fast as my oldest son was in highschool and he used it too.</li>
            <li>It honestly seems as if it&#x27;s watered down to me.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing this since high school and every one of my female freinds love this.</li>
            <li>It does smell really good, however, it does not last all day long.</li>
            <li>Just be smart, if it looks tampered with, return it.</li>
            <li>The smell is so smelly it smelled a certain smell all over me</li>
            <li>Its definately a classic!</li>
            <li>While their are similar fragrances out there, Curve offers a slight variation, making it slightly unique and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Nice that it costs less than many other brands too.</li>
            <li>This smells similar, but there is a huge noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Curve for over 10 years and still enjoy using it as much as I did back then.  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for the real deal do NOT get this.</li>
            <li>its reasonable priced my wife loves it too</li>
            <li>the price is affordable and its the real thing.</li>
            <li>thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
            <li>very affordable for every day use.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t really like one of the spinoffs I tried, Curve Crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived</li>
            <li>Not so much now.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t matter much, because my husband didn&#x27;t want to keep the tin.</li>
            <li>not the real curve.</li>
            <li>My husband had a bottle of the real stuff</li>
            <li>The real stuff lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>Either sell the real deal, or don&#x27;t pretend that you are.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s really all I need :  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a real shame that amazon sells stuff like that.</li>
            <li>The real beauty of Curve is the price/value and versatility.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not there, but I did find on the can the legal notice saying, &amp;#</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and Seller.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even really smell it anymore because I have become so accustomed to the smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s engraved or etched on the real thing.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I spray on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Its much cheaper than Wal-mart</li>
            <li>I am absolutely speechless that Amazon would carry or allow its sellers to carry fakes.</li>
            <li>no way in Hell this is the real deal..</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m partial but I absolutely LOVE this cologne.</li>
            <li>He still wears it just not as much.</li>
            <li>I have had more compliments on this cologne than any other I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with their careful packaging, and will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Good subtle hint of fragrance.</li>
            <li>It can be worn as a daily fragrance, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>quick google search reveals that this really is the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Curve cologne, as it got moved over to &amp;#34;EA&amp;#34; as above in 2009.  </li>
            <li>I have used curve for a long time and I enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>While the bottle is nothing more than average, I do like the clip prohibiting spraying unless removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>worth the extra few bucks for the stronger and nice and smell.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in years, but now that I&#x27;m trying it again, I feel sure the manufacturer has diluted this fragrance down...</li>
            <li>Either old or not the real stuff, i have used the real stuff from the store</li>
            <li>Classic</li>
            <li>This is one of the steady parts of my cologne collection which I always keep 16 bottles in stock.</li>
            <li>So if you like those, you will like this particular Curve.  </li>
            <li>Classic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Been using it aimce high school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it since high school</li>
            <li>smell is nowhere near the quality of the real curve.</li>
            <li>Great smell, mediocre longevity.</li>
            <li>I found several websites stating that Amazon is losing its reputation with colognes due to so many knock off items being received and not the real material ordered....</li>
            <li>It would appear that a large % of the cologne was drained from the bottle and a high grade alcohol was put back in the bottle - this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>the new one doesn&#x27;t say Claiborne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the new version of the Cologne by EA NOT Liz Claiborne.</li>
            <li>I saved so much and recieved  it with some other items purchased here quickly.</li>
            <li>The potency of the real fragrance vs this product is much longer lasting.</li>
            <li>We would have it no other way !!!</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a half hour in our bottle we just got here.  </li>
            <li>The current rate on Amazon is a little over $25 for a large bottle - with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I don&#x27;t know what to say.</li>
            <li>So its not amazons fault completely.</li>
            <li>Purchased this cologne as a gift for y 13 year old nephew.  </li>
            <li>Curve are all different so don&#x27;t discount the whole lineup if you happen to dislike one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or what</li>
            <li>So naturally when he runs out of cologne...</li>
            <li>Definitely a masculine fragrance.  </li>
            <li>the \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot;, for the price it can not be matched.  </li>
            <li>my 22 year old son loves it and loves the size of the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had complimants from complete strangers .</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not heavy over powering and musky.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve been kind enough to offer me a refund on my shipping, but it was in exchange for removal of my negative feedback.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the smell does not last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about ordering a Cologne online.&lt;br /&gt;The price and convenience of home delivery was too good to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The longevity of the fragrance is also above average, lasting six (6) to eight (8) hours on the skin and even longer on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>It has a powerful but not overwhelming scent that goes great for casual events or just a day at the office.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, the aroma of the &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34; Curve was evident on my clothes several days after prior to laundering.</li>
            <li>It smells like a very very exclusive scent that is classy and long lasting, but not overpowering,</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and enjoy the scent.  </li>
            <li>I would have to agree with other reviews that this is a much watered down version of the original Curve.</li>
            <li>It has always been a major part of my cologne selections and the SO loves it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of those that you can distinctly tell the difference from other colognes.</li>
            <li>When I used to wear this in high school, one spray was enough to choke you, and the fragrance would last all day.  </li>
            <li>Their buying power and lack of physical store front really drive down the price on what is usually a high mark up product.</li>
            <li>Especially since the ladies clearly like it.</li>
            <li>scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as the real curve</li>
            <li>I could even smell the old one myself on my clothes after several hours, but not with this one I just received off Amazon.</li>
            <li>Only problem I had was sending it directly to Michigan.  </li>
            <li>only 15 years old</li>
            <li>FAKE FRAUD  SAYS CANY RETURN FOR SAFETY REASONS LMAO</li>
            <li>yes, but my husband still gets random people ask what kind of cologne is he wearing.</li>
            <li>Not too strong and not too subtle.</li>
            <li>not real but came fast and smells similar!</li>
            <li>However, a little does go a long way since it can be fairly powerful.</li>
            <li>The fragrance only lasts five minutes, very watered down.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the last few bottles I have purchased, the sprayer does not put out a good amount and it tends to drip down on my hand.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have bought this cologne at Department stores and I loved it.</li>

            <li> he really enjoys smelling good.</li>
            <li> and I was able to have it shipped straight to my door for a price better than driving to the retail store to get it!</li>

            <li> Ever since I started wearing it everyone questions why I have switched to &#x27;Axe&#x27; or &#x27;Cheap cologne&#x27;.</li>

            <li> the original.  </li>

            <li> Great smell, lasts long , and get loads  of compliments,.</li>
            <li> fresh smell...love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this still smells like the original stuff I had before it.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not a scam--the original company just delegated it out.</li>
            <li> Not so sure its the real thing though!</li>
            <li> Got it for a friend for his birthday and was so excited.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pleasing scent...not too strong!</li>
            <li> Always presents a clean and woderful aroma.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong, just right.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great and is stronger than the other curve colognes that are available for a lower price here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Only compliant would be dented nearly crushed top on bottle though in perfect working condition  I spray and smell aaaaaamaaaaazingggg!</li>
            <li> But, it smells good and brings back memories.</li>
            <li> and this was the most reasonable.</li>
            <li> But I just love it so much.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really a gift for me :)</li>
            <li> I have had several people comment on how good it smells.  </li>
            <li> It has a sensual and sweet aromatic smell.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s such a good cologne</li>
            <li> I have been using Curve for at least 20 years and it&#x27;s one of the best products I have used.  </li>
            <li> Good price for a big bottle of it.</li>
            <li> I notice the scent is not as strong as the original and fades much sooner.</li>
            <li> It has a clean and fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
            <li> Lucky.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery...</li>

            <li> This was exactly what I wanted and at a fabulous price.  </li>
            <li> orders always arrive very quickly, and very well</li>

            <li> I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li> In the bottle the name of \\&quot;curve\\&quot; was a sticker that was put crooked and almost peeling on both bottles lmao...</li>
            <li> /&gt;NOT WORTH $25....</li>
            <li> It does really smell good, but just does not go the extra mile.</li>
            <li> My 18yr old sons favorite scent</li>
            <li> and it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> And now even my kids are following in my footsteps after lots of occasions of coughing them spraying my own.</li>
            <li> Finally thought it was time to get them their own....</li>
            <li> hope amazon wont encourage this kind of generic products.</li>
            <li> the price  was worth it.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift and it was not a disappointment</li>
            <li> Not the best smelling, but for a low price it is not bad compared to paying $100+ for much less volume of name brands nowadays.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, not strong, husband loves it</li>
            <li> really customer friendly refunded me the  </li>
            <li> No matter how long it&#x27;s been around, Curve will always be my favorite!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate that the item was not broken, however, it was pretty &#x27;banged&#x27; up from rolling around against the tin.</li>
            <li> Not to strong but very masculine.</li>
            <li> It is a light scent, but strong enough for people to notice.</li>
            <li> This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> A classic cologne never fails, long lasting cologne the best!</li>
            <li> and as always, the price is right ;)</li>
            <li> Mixed with Old Spice deodarant and you be smelling good.</li>
            <li> It shipped very fast and was at my door in no time.</li>
            <li> My favorite for ten years or so now!</li>
            <li> Of the hundreds of items I have purchased from Amazon this is the first I have attempted to return.</li>
            <li> Like the cologne and better buy than at the local department stores!</li>
            <li> this isnt it , lost scent fast!</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> I used to spray some of this on when it first came out when I was kid.</li>
            <li> ;-).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and wanted.</li>
            <li> Fabulous men&#x27;s classy smell.</li>
            <li> Much better than the local stores and malls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my husband loves it too ;)</li>
            <li> I will most definately go through Amazon for future purchases.</li>
            <li> was fast!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves this scent!</li>
            <li> interestingly, the perfume even though looks identical to those from big-box retailers smells different.</li>
            <li> first off......</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent since it first came out.</li>
            <li> (so does everyone else ;).</li>
            <li> Beyond that it says it&#x27;s made in USA and distributed by &amp;#34;EA Fragrances Co.&amp;#34; in NYC, which evidently also has a basis in London.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing curve since 1999 (this exact type).</li>
            <li> thanks again guys!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought Curve was about 12or 14 years ago.</li>
            <li> Will more than likely where it for another 5+ and beyond.</li>
            <li> First of all the word curve is stuck in the bottle like a label.</li>
            <li> After using the bottle of Curve I received from Amazon for the first time this morning, I am absolutely mortified!</li>
            <li> It has become my signature since my then girlfriend (now wife) gifted it to me 13 years back.</li>
            <li> Curve has a strong, yet very tolerable masculine smell.</li>
            <li> I was initially quite upset but Amazon made it right by giving me a full refund AND the item!</li>
            <li> but for 12-15$ I will be the original next time unless I need this for myself when I get out the gym for a quick spray</li>
            <li> The first couple bottles went fast as my oldest son was in highschool and he used it too.</li>
            <li> It honestly seems as if it&#x27;s watered down to me.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing this since high school and every one of my female freinds love this.</li>
            <li> It does smell really good, however, it does not last all day long.</li>
            <li> Just be smart, if it looks tampered with, return it.</li>
            <li> The smell is so smelly it smelled a certain smell all over me</li>
            <li> Its definately a classic!</li>
            <li> While their are similar fragrances out there, Curve offers a slight variation, making it slightly unique and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Nice that it costs less than many other brands too.</li>
            <li> This smells similar, but there is a huge noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Curve for over 10 years and still enjoy using it as much as I did back then.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for the real deal do NOT get this.</li>
            <li> its reasonable priced my wife loves it too</li>
            <li> the price is affordable and its the real thing.</li>
            <li> thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
            <li> very affordable for every day use.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t really like one of the spinoffs I tried, Curve Crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived</li>
            <li> Not so much now.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter much, because my husband didn&#x27;t want to keep the tin.</li>
            <li> not the real curve.</li>
            <li> My husband had a bottle of the real stuff</li>
            <li> The real stuff lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> Either sell the real deal, or don&#x27;t pretend that you are.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really all I need :  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a real shame that amazon sells stuff like that.</li>
            <li> The real beauty of Curve is the price/value and versatility.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not there, but I did find on the can the legal notice saying, &amp;#</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and Seller.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even really smell it anymore because I have become so accustomed to the smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s engraved or etched on the real thing.</li>
            <li> no matter how much I spray on.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Its much cheaper than Wal-mart</li>
            <li> I am absolutely speechless that Amazon would carry or allow its sellers to carry fakes.</li>
            <li> no way in Hell this is the real deal..</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m partial but I absolutely LOVE this cologne.</li>
            <li> He still wears it just not as much.</li>
            <li> I have had more compliments on this cologne than any other I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with their careful packaging, and will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Good subtle hint of fragrance.</li>
            <li> It can be worn as a daily fragrance, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> quick google search reveals that this really is the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Curve cologne, as it got moved over to &amp;#34;EA&amp;#34; as above in 2009.  </li>
            <li> I have used curve for a long time and I enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> While the bottle is nothing more than average, I do like the clip prohibiting spraying unless removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worth the extra few bucks for the stronger and nice and smell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in years, but now that I&#x27;m trying it again, I feel sure the manufacturer has diluted this fragrance down...</li>
            <li> Either old or not the real stuff, i have used the real stuff from the store</li>
            <li> Classic</li>
            <li> This is one of the steady parts of my cologne collection which I always keep 16 bottles in stock.</li>
            <li> So if you like those, you will like this particular Curve.  </li>
            <li> Classic.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Been using it aimce high school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it since high school</li>
            <li> smell is nowhere near the quality of the real curve.</li>
            <li> Great smell, mediocre longevity.</li>
            <li> I found several websites stating that Amazon is losing its reputation with colognes due to so many knock off items being received and not the real material ordered....</li>
            <li> It would appear that a large % of the cologne was drained from the bottle and a high grade alcohol was put back in the bottle - this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li> the new one doesn&#x27;t say Claiborne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the new version of the Cologne by EA NOT Liz Claiborne.</li>
            <li> I saved so much and recieved  it with some other items purchased here quickly.</li>
            <li> The potency of the real fragrance vs this product is much longer lasting.</li>
            <li> We would have it no other way !!!</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a half hour in our bottle we just got here.  </li>
            <li> The current rate on Amazon is a little over $25 for a large bottle - with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I don&#x27;t know what to say.</li>
            <li> So its not amazons fault completely.</li>
            <li> Purchased this cologne as a gift for y 13 year old nephew.  </li>
            <li> Curve are all different so don&#x27;t discount the whole lineup if you happen to dislike one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or what</li>
            <li> So naturally when he runs out of cologne...</li>
            <li> Definitely a masculine fragrance.  </li>
            <li> the \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot;, for the price it can not be matched.  </li>
            <li> my 22 year old son loves it and loves the size of the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had complimants from complete strangers .</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not heavy over powering and musky.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve been kind enough to offer me a refund on my shipping, but it was in exchange for removal of my negative feedback.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the smell does not last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering a Cologne online.&lt;br /&gt;The price and convenience of home delivery was too good to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The longevity of the fragrance is also above average, lasting six (6) to eight (8) hours on the skin and even longer on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> It has a powerful but not overwhelming scent that goes great for casual events or just a day at the office.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, the aroma of the &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34; Curve was evident on my clothes several days after prior to laundering.</li>
            <li> It smells like a very very exclusive scent that is classy and long lasting, but not overpowering,</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and enjoy the scent.  </li>
            <li> I would have to agree with other reviews that this is a much watered down version of the original Curve.</li>
            <li> It has always been a major part of my cologne selections and the SO loves it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely one of those that you can distinctly tell the difference from other colognes.</li>
            <li> When I used to wear this in high school, one spray was enough to choke you, and the fragrance would last all day.  </li>
            <li> Their buying power and lack of physical store front really drive down the price on what is usually a high mark up product.</li>
            <li> Especially since the ladies clearly like it.</li>
            <li> scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as the real curve</li>
            <li> I could even smell the old one myself on my clothes after several hours, but not with this one I just received off Amazon.</li>
            <li> Only problem I had was sending it directly to Michigan.  </li>
            <li> only 15 years old</li>
            <li> FAKE FRAUD  SAYS CANY RETURN FOR SAFETY REASONS LMAO</li>
            <li> yes, but my husband still gets random people ask what kind of cologne is he wearing.</li>
            <li> Not too strong and not too subtle.</li>
            <li> not real but came fast and smells similar!</li>
            <li> However, a little does go a long way since it can be fairly powerful.</li>
            <li> The fragrance only lasts five minutes, very watered down.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the last few bottles I have purchased, the sprayer does not put out a good amount and it tends to drip down on my hand.  </li>
            <li> Curve offers above average projection and sillage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard in this economy to spend alot in cologne, but deals like this really helps!</li>
            <li> So, even though they were polite in being willing to refund my shipping, I can&#x27;t remove my negative feedback.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby and he ask me why the smell doesnt last long..</li>
            <li> I do not know, it could be my chemistry of my skin that causes it not to last that long.</li>
            <li> doesnt last long and takes 5 sprays.</li>
            <li> The smell didnot last long.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed because I thought I was getting a good deal.  </li>
            <li> My old bottle is dark green on the left and the one I just received is clear bottle.</li>
            <li> I remember using this fragrance a long time ago</li>
            <li> Hopefully this fragrance sticks around for a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased for convenience but honestly I will procure from a retail store next time to ensure quality - a shame and unfortunately disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was a big hit in late 90s!&lt;br /&gt;Had to go old school for a while!  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing Curve for years and like other reviewers stated, I would get compliments several hours after I put it on, and that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.  </li>
            <li> This is not an expensive item neither a unique item</li>
            <li> any other curve that I&#x27;ve ever purchased, it takes 1~2 sprays...that would last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> He loves that the scent lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Very strange to me</li>
            <li> packaging is above average and I am digging the metal boxes - a little extra cushion if you keep and use for travel.  </li>
            <li> Also the spray nozzle was dented upon arrival making it harder to spray.</li>
            <li> No thanks.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was not as expected.</li>
            <li> Order this for my father came as expected</li>
            <li> He tries other colognes every once in a while, but Curve is go to cologne.  </li>
            <li> Liz Claiborne\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the freakin&#x27; reviews, but it&#x27;s ridiculous that Amazon doesn&#x27;t force these types of things to be marked as FAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will not buy this product from Amazon.com again and will go back to purchasing it in department stores like in the past.  </li>
            <li> Other than that...</li>
            <li> I received my product, based on other reviews I had seen, I looked for &amp;</li>
            <li> This is not the same Curve I&#x27;ve been ordering for the past two or three years from Amazon.</li>
            <li> as other reviewers say, this product is fake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It should be disclosed that it is a knock-off imitation of Curve and should also be priced accordingly.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve worn a handful of different scents in my adult life, and I&#x27;ve never had random strangers compliment me on one I&#x27;ve worn until Curve.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t get faker than that, the can comes in a different color, the sticker in the bottle is fake, the scent it&#x27;s kinda like it but doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m certain mine is fake.</li>
            <li> The smell is not right either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a cologne that works with your individual chemistry.</li>
            <li> you didn&#x27;t this is what the product is now and it is not worth a dime.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the dark bottle says Liz Claiborne&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think that people who are selling knockoffs should be allowed to sell on here pretending it&#x27;s the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> I replied to the e-mail I got from the seller, only to get a response requesting to removed my previous negative feedback.  </li>
            <li> seemed water down a bit.</li>
            <li> but if anyone else receives a fake after this...then it is only due to amazon not following thru with their vendor.....</li>
            <li> (I mean the opposite sex - don&#x27;t tell Sweetie I made that comment..).  </li>
            <li> also, it has less retention power.</li>
            <li> I like Chrome, Chrome Legend, Kenneth Cole reaction, Touch, Black,</li>
            <li> #34;Liz Clairborne&amp;#34; labeling, as there was on my previous bottle.  </li>
            <li> did not look like any bottle of curve that I have previously purchased</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my father &amp; my brother (bought 2) and all thou its clearly not original...</li>
            <li> The lid of the tin, did arrive with a little dent.  </li>
            <li> , i put a little bit around my body and then put on my clothes, boy do i</li>
            <li> I know this cologne was watered down!</li>
            <li> A few years ago a couple women I worked with stopped me and said &amp;</li>
            <li> It did take a few days to come tho</li>
            <li> the Claiborne wording  is missing from the box and bottle....</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and he uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I read in a few reviews that Elizabeth Arden now produces the Curve cologne line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and overpowering.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my rotation as my daily scent because I don&#x27;t get tired of it</li>
            <li> 4.2 Ounce Cologne Spray\\&quot; i got today, is certainly NOT the product advertised!!!</li>
            <li> The strength is very weak compared to previous examples of the same product I have purchased.</li>
            <li> They have falsely advertised the product and they&#x27;ve had multiple negative feedback out of it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they are allowed to sell watered down cologne on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> (I usually use it once or twice a week).</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled, this product is decidedly fake, at no place on the box or bottle does it say Liz Claiborne, and in fact, the gold &amp;#34;Curve&amp;#34; on the bottle is actually a sticker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure my purchase.</li>
            <li> waste your money here!</li>
            <li> I wound up returning the small bottle to the store &amp; keeping this to give as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> A sticker on the bottle itself that says &#x27;Curve&#x27; which I don&#x27;t remember being a sticker when I used this in the past.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell awful and actually lasted for about 5 hours, as I sprayed it on my arm to test it when first recieving it and then mowed a couple of lawns and it remained.  </li>
            <li> Not overwhelming, doesn&#x27;t pinpoint you in a crowd</li>
            <li> I usually spray about 3-4 sprays.</li>
            <li> After using it for 7 days everyday on my skin, cloth(very generous amount)within 15 minutes, smell is gone, And  I mean gone.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS POOR QUALITY WATERED DOWN</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS POOR QUALITY WATERED DOWN</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS POOR QUALITY WATERED DOWN</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS POOR QUALITY WATERED DOWN</li>
            <li> I can hardly smell it when I spray it.</li>
            <li> but i belive it is since the smell dont last like the other curves i had had &#x3D;/ ,,,,,,,, so i dont know</li>
            <li> I get at least 1 or 2 compliments every time I wear it somewhere</li>
            <li> I bought from this seller because reviews from other sellers talked about fake cologne.</li>
            <li> i mean i been using it for about 2 yrs now.</li>
            <li> fake as a 3 dollar bill, watered down joke!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was that the lid of the container came beaten</li>
            <li> I saw the other reviews saying that the product delivered is fake, and even so, I decided to take the risk of purchasing it anyway, knowing that on the off chance it was in fact fake, I could return it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon needs to at the very least strip this seller of its prime status and should remove it from the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It turned out to be OK...but could have gone worse.</li>
            <li> during approximately 8 hrs.  </li>
            <li> I receive a ton of compliments and never give away the secret that it is an affordable cologne.</li>
            <li> , i am very disappointed and would really like a refund of some sort, also you should probably remove the label you have for this item..as it is NOT curve by Liz Claiborne, i&#x27;d expect these types of products from a random street hustler, not Amazon.com LLC</li>
            <li> but the scent is very weak compared to any I have bought before.</li>
            <li> how did I know it was fake?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with it...</li>
            <li> but it is fake not by Liz Claiborne.&lt;br /&gt;Not sealed when it came</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for 1 star rating</li>
            <li> but it is fake.</li>
            <li> When I saw it on Amazon I thought I&#x27;d get it (knowing there may be risk in getting the wrong one).</li>
            <li> : Product is fake and cannot be returned per Amazon&#x27;s policy.</li>
            <li> So if you think you got a fake</li>
            <li> It is so noticeably fake</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think that indicates fake, because it&#x27;s like that all over the web.</li>
            <li> so i guess you could end up with a fake, but i&#x27;d buy from this seller again based on shipping time, price, packaging and</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with curve.</li>
            <li> Instead, I got a fake.  </li>
            <li> but the thing is that i belive it is fake</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong by sending this as a gift.  </li>
            <li> Please listen to me when I tell you I received a fake.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Curve.</li>
            <li> One can never go wrong with Curve for men.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i was furious because i cannot believe amazon would sell a fake</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Which made me wonder if the  cologne i got was really a fake.</li>
            <li> It can be somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> This product STINKS.</li>
            <li> Never go wrong with Curve!</li>
            <li> This is fake!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Curve!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to learn that this is not a returnable item \\&quot;for safety</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the product as well though, so I can&#x27;t change my feedback.  </li>
            <li> My dad loves this crap.</li>
            <li> I hate the mall.</li>
            <li> so disappointed with this purchase!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed here.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed..</li>
            <li> , I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> The decal on the bottle is terrible...</li>
            <li> -WORST  </li>
            <li> ROBBED ON HARD EARNED MONEY !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am disgusted by Amazon!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So many compliments on the smell. Mixed with Old Spice deodarant and you be smelling good.</li>
            <li> fake as a 3 dollar bill, watered down joke!</li>
            <li> I got this Curve to replace my soon to be depleted bottle. The actual Curve smells divine and I get so many compliments on it. This smells similar, but there is a huge noticeable difference. It doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good as the real version. Ever since I started wearing it everyone questions why I have switched to &#x27;Axe&#x27; or &#x27;Cheap cologne&#x27;. This is an okay smelling product but if you&#x27;re looking for the real deal do NOT get this. Also the spray nozzle was dented upon arrival making it harder to spray. I would not recommend this knock off.</li>
            <li> very clean smelling some colognes can give me a headache love this one and its reasonable priced my wife loves it too</li>
            <li> Loved this for years!</li>
            <li> good  value - smells  great - large  bottle  and has  spray  device</li>
            <li> I remember using this fragrance a long time ago and it is just as I remember it. The value for the 4.2 ounce is a great price. I get a lot of compliments wearing this fragrance.</li>
            <li> A few years ago a couple women I worked with stopped me and said &amp;#34;we want you to get some Curve.&amp;#34; My response: &amp;#34;Huh? what&#x27;s that?&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Cologne! We love it and we want you to gtet some and start wearing it to work!&amp;#34;  Well what could I do but oblige them. I&#x27;d never heard of it until then but once I bought it I became a fan. Especially since the ladies clearly like it. The first couple bottles went fast as my oldest son was in highschool and he used it too. Curve is definitely one of the colognes I like to keep around. The bottle I bought from this seller seems genuine, is good quality and I&#x27;d recommend buying from this seller if you&#x27;re looking for Curve.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE mens cologne. Never go wrong with Curve!</li>
            <li> My husband loves the smell</li>
            <li> This item was amazing ... it was a gift for my father &amp; my brother (bought 2) and all thou its clearly not original... I can tell since I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years as well is till preety darn good!! For the price and as an add on gift there no complaints in my behalf... ad how did I know it was fake? In the bottle the name of \\&quot;curve\\&quot; was a sticker that was put crooked and almost peeling on both bottles lmao... but for 12-15$ I will be the original next time unless I need this for myself when I get out the gym for a quick spray</li>
            <li> love it love it love it!  Everyone asks what it is....the price is affordable and its the real thing.</li>
            <li> The best scent in the world. I have been wearing Curve for many years and will never change!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for hubby for Christmas!  It&#x27;s his favorite and for this price you can&#x27;t pass it up!!!  It arrived quickly, safely packed, and he was Very happy to receive it!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Stays on for hours!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and great value!</li>
            <li> This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product. thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
            <li> My favorite for ten years or so now! 60$ at the shop I was just at. I saved so much and recieved  it with some other items purchased here quickly. Only compliant would be dented nearly crushed top on bottle though in perfect working condition  I spray and smell aaaaaamaaaaazingggg! I ignore the top and rate 5 great purchase love love love it brah. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is fake! I bought this for my hubby and he ask me why the smell doesnt last long.. We been using curve for 10 years  and im so disappointed with this purchase!  I would never buy this anymore!</li>
            <li> i have ordered 2x and both completley happy with both purchases thank u..plan on ordering again very soon!</li>
            <li> FAKE FRAUD  SAYS CANY RETURN FOR SAFETY REASONS LMAO</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne, I love the smell and so does everyone else!!!</li>
            <li> Both my son&#x27;s love this cologne for men..It smells so good..</li>
            <li> This product STINKS. Of the hundreds of items I have purchased from Amazon this is the first I have attempted to return. I was disappointed to learn that this is not a returnable item \\&quot;for safety reasons\\&quot;. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I wish I could give it a lower rating than one star.</li>
            <li> Like his Dad, this is also my son&#x27;s favorite cologne.  His girlfriend likes it too.  Not too strong, just right.</li>
            <li> When I used to wear this in high school, one spray was enough to choke you, and the fragrance would last all day.  It was very, very strong.  I haven&#x27;t used it in years, but now that I&#x27;m trying it again, I feel sure the manufacturer has diluted this fragrance down... it doesn&#x27;t last all day. But, it smells good and brings back memories.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this crap.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne, I have many different colognes, but this is the best of them all!</li>
            <li> I received the item after it was supposed to be shipped to me before Fathers Day. I was initially quite upset but Amazon made it right by giving me a full refund AND the item! So now I am a very satisfied customer. Thank you Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Been using curve for years. Can&#x27;t go wrong with it...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering a Cologne online.&lt;br /&gt;The price and convenience of home delivery was too good to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this purchase and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My son asked for this, was so happy to find such a great price. Amazon always has what I need when I need it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the hubby for Christmas! Soooooooo gooooooood! The price was great and the smell even better! Not to strong but very masculine.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product! Excellent price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My first smelly spray ever, smelly like good smelly</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, because he loves Curve.  The price is fantastic for the size of the bottle.  He loves that the scent lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is an OK cologne but it is fake not by Liz Claiborne.&lt;br /&gt;Not sealed when it came&lt;br /&gt;Should say CURVE by Liz Claiborne but nope&lt;br /&gt;Plastic sticker saying curve&lt;br /&gt;NOT WORTH $25.... MAYBE $10&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTING&lt;br /&gt;AND NOW HOW DO I RETURN THIS TO AMAZON...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Amazon really customer friendly refunded me the  ***&lt;br /&gt;***next day so online with service like this possibly ***&lt;br /&gt;***more online cologne purchases  THANK YOU AMAZON  ***</li>
            <li> I bought from this seller because reviews from other sellers talked about fake cologne. My boyfriend has been wearing this curve for years, and I can attest that the cologne from this seller is the authentic curve we all know and love. I am very pleased with their careful packaging, and will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I have had more compliments on this cologne than any other I have ever used. I will continue using it as long as the compliments continue, lol</li>
            <li> Great cologne, not strong, husband loves it and I do too.  Got it on time for Christmas in a great condition.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; - I wasn&#x27;t.. it&#x27;s the same price in the stores.. (Target, Ross, etc)</li>
            <li> very refreshing scent. really good price too. very affordable for every day use. my dad loves it. i would buy again</li>
            <li> He loves the scent an oldie but a goodie</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take me wrong, I love Curve cologne but I&#x27;m certain mine is fake. After using it for 7 days everyday on my skin, cloth(very generous amount)within 15 minutes, smell is gone, And  I mean gone. I&#x27;m sorry for 1 star rating but i have to rate this for what i have and not for what it might have been.</li>
            <li> good smell that worked out good for my style. I enjoy a scent that is not overbearing and clean smelling. Oh, She likes it too!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just like this smell, I love when my husband wears it. At our local Dept. Store, it would be about double the price. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Wow, I don&#x27;t know what to say. This is a good cologne but it is fake. Its not by Liz Claiborne. It was not sealed when it came, I just got the cologne, and the bottle should say CURVE by Liz Claiborne....but nowhere can you see this anywhere. If people keep doing this NOBODY will buy colognes online. They are just trashing this market. Amazon do something or you wont get revenue from selling perfumes online. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is one of my son&#x27;s favorite colognes.&lt;br /&gt;Could not believe the price on Amazon--&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Came in a tin lidded container and is&lt;br /&gt;a nice sized bottle.  Will be ordering&lt;br /&gt;it from here again  in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> i just can to say it product is exelent and they have sold as an exelent way so for that i am convenced to buy here againg.</li>
            <li> The women at work always compliment me on wearing this. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Curve by Liz Claiborne for Men - 4.2 Ounce Cologne Spray\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;by Liz Claiborne\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the freakin&#x27; reviews, but it&#x27;s ridiculous that Amazon doesn&#x27;t force these types of things to be marked as FAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EH, oh well.  Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> I love my items great price</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with other reviews that this is a much watered down version of the original Curve. I have been wearing Curve for years and like other reviewers stated, I would get compliments several hours after I put it on, and that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.  I could even smell the old one myself on my clothes after several hours, but not with this one I just received off Amazon. As a matter of fact, the aroma of the &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34; Curve was evident on my clothes several days after prior to laundering. I don&#x27;t know why it is sold as Curve.....the original.  It should be disclosed that it is a knock-off imitation of Curve and should also be priced accordingly. I will not buy this product from Amazon.com again and will go back to purchasing it in department stores like in the past.  Very disappointed here.</li>
            <li> Not by Liz Claiborne as described. Amazon did however refund me the money. Should&#x27;ve read the reviews before buying.  The fragrance only lasts five minutes, very watered down.</li>
            <li> It does smell really good, however, it does not last all day long. It seems to be present for about three or four hours. I do not know, it could be my chemistry of my skin that causes it not to last that long. It does really smell good, but just does not go the extra mile.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FITS MY NEEDS WELL AND AT A GREAT PRICE! I LOVE THAT AMAZON IS A ONE STOP PLACE TO FIND WHAT EVERY I NEED AT A GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> This is a great scent that I first found out about when it was featured in GQ magazine. When I saw it on Amazon I thought I&#x27;d get it (knowing there may be risk in getting the wrong one). The price was great considering how much you get. It will last me longer than a year :-D (I usually use it once or twice a week).</li>
            <li> Well I have had it for a day and I am getting compliments on it. It smells good too. I smelt it on a friend, and as a guy it I loved it. Alot of female friends of mine say they like it! :) My cologne is going to last a while because when I sprayed it, it didnt last like 2 hours like some reviewers here. Just be smart, if it looks tampered with, return it. Dont blame amazon. Amazon connects you to sellers too. So its not amazons fault completely.</li>
            <li> I know this is for men, but I love it. And when my doctor, who is a female found out it was for men she could not believe it. She loves it to.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loved it plus he smells great when he wears it.</li>
            <li> No matter how long it&#x27;s been around, Curve will always be my favorite! I got this for my fella for his stocking on Christmas morning, and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll love it just as much as I do!</li>
            <li> My 18yr old sons favorite scent and I&#x27;ve priced it many places and this was the most reasonable. It did take a few days to come tho but my son was so happy to get it!</li>
            <li> Like the cologne and better buy than at the local department stores!</li>
            <li> I saw the other reviews saying that the product delivered is fake, and even so, I decided to take the risk of purchasing it anyway, knowing that on the off chance it was in fact fake, I could return it.  Do not be fooled, this product is decidedly fake, at no place on the box or bottle does it say Liz Claiborne, and in fact, the gold &amp;#34;Curve&amp;#34; on the bottle is actually a sticker.  When I went to return it, I was informed that because this product is flammable, it cannot be returned.  There was no option to appeal, or an option to speak to anyone about being ripped off so ludicrously, instead, I was invited to &amp;#34;continue shopping.&amp;#34;  No thanks.  Amazon needs to at the very least strip this seller of its prime status and should remove it from the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tldr: Product is fake and cannot be returned per Amazon&#x27;s policy.</li>
            <li> Came fast, which was great for Christmas. The item was packaged great, I did not have to worry about the bottle breaking or tin being dented.</li>
            <li> this is such an awesome fragrance.. bought for my friend but its so amazing i couldn&#x27;t resist to keep it for myself only.. and moreover it got delivered 2 days earlier than the estimated time...&lt;br /&gt;Curve has the best fragrances of all...and long stay too..</li>
            <li> It would appear that a large % of the cologne was drained from the bottle and a high grade alcohol was put back in the bottle - this is not the real deal. The potency of the real fragrance vs this product is much longer lasting. I figured out how they did it - it is all in the  valve system you can drain the bottle by pushing in the ball valve and then do the same when you go to refill it. Beware.</li>
            <li> Uno de los mejores perfumes del mercado</li>
            <li> This is a great scent for men.  It has a clean and fresh smell.  It&#x27;s not too strong and wears off rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I use this to spray on the air filters in the house.  I know, I know.... But I just love it so much.  I have it for my husband too...lol.</li>
            <li> Packaging was not as expected. The lid was off and the box rattled when it arrived. Thought it was busted up. It turned out to be OK...but could have gone worse.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I&#x27;ve worn it for over 10 years. Amazon is definitely the place to purchase cologne. Their buying power and lack of physical store front really drive down the price on what is usually a high mark up product. I&#x27;ll be buying again in the future from Amazon for this.</li>
            <li> Just know that the original curve smell is not what it used to be.  You used to be able to spray this on and smell good for hours now you spray this on and smell good for 15 minutes and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re lucky. This cologne does not have the staying power that used to, it has changed. So if you think you got a fake you didn&#x27;t this is what the product is now and it is not worth a dime.</li>
            <li> This was ordered as a request from someone I love.</li>
            <li> Either old or not the real stuff, i have used the real stuff from the store this isnt it , lost scent fast!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent and even though it&#x27;s not a designer fragrance.  It&#x27;s still the same as it&#x27;s been years ago. She doesn&#x27;t really like one of the spinoffs I tried, Curve Crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived with plenty of bubble wrap so it didn&#x27;t break in transit and it saved me a trip to the department store!  I hate the mall.</li>
            <li> I got it for my boyfriend, it smells so good. And for the size of the bottle it is a great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure my purchase. My old bottle is dark green on the left and the one I just received is clear bottle. The bottom of the dark bottle says Liz Claiborne&lt;br /&gt;and the new one doesn&#x27;t say Claiborne.&lt;br /&gt;I should have just gone to target.&lt;br /&gt;Now I know this cologne was watered down! I tried it over the weekend and sprayed it on myself several times but the scent dissipated in minutes!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money here! I can&#x27;t believe they are allowed to sell watered down cologne on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Scents fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite smell goods!</li>
            <li> When the product came shipped to the house the bottle was rolling around in the box, outside of the tin in which it is supposed to come in. I was fortunate that the item was not broken, however, it was pretty &#x27;banged&#x27; up from rolling around against the tin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.. The decal on the bottle is terrible... its a sticker. It is so noticeably fake I can&#x27;t even give this as a gift. The smell is not right either.</li>
            <li> Great smell last all day!!! Great gift for that special man on your life ! And you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> I can hardly smell it when I spray it. At first, I thought it a great price for the maker. Not so much now.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne.  Amazon sells it cheaper than any department store.  The lid of the tin, did arrive with a little dent.  I think it could have been packaged better for shipping.  It didn&#x27;t matter much, because my husband didn&#x27;t want to keep the tin.</li>
            <li> Curve is a great fragrance. I use it when going out daily. It can be worn as a daily fragrance, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for special occasions. It is a light scent, but strong enough for people to notice. I often get compliments on it and questions about what it is. Great cologne at a good price.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot smells good</li>
            <li> This is my work cologne. It is great at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;The price in department stores is about twice the price I paid on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I get complimented daily on this cologne.</li>
            <li> Purchased this cologne as a gift for y 13 year old nephew.  He absolutely loves it!  I used to spray some of this on when it first came out when I was kid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I&#x27;ts  GREAT</li>
            <li> Order this for my father came as expected</li>
            <li> Every time I go out with my man when he is wearing this cologne he gets stopped and complimented on how nice he smells by men &amp; ladies! He is very hansome too the combination makes me feel very happy to be with my smasher!! ;-).</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son...he&#x27;s been wearing it for years.  He tries other colognes every once in a while, but Curve is go to cologne.  It&#x27;s a very pleasing scent...not too strong!</li>
            <li> not the real curve. smell is nowhere near the quality of the real curve. doesnt last long and takes 5 sprays. wouldnt recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Delivered quickly! Recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Best cologne i have ever use.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne. Everytime he wears it I gravitate towards him. It is great. As soon as he sprays it, I know.</li>
            <li> This is my boyfriends favourite cologne, and now its mine too. He smells so good wearing this. I highly recommend it. It came in the metal container so there was no worries of it being damaged during shipping.</li>
            <li> this product was a great deal for the price.  would definitely recommend it for others to purchase.  love this scent.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and wanted.</li>
            <li> Fabulous men&#x27;s classy smell. Purchased for father for a Christmas present. He enjoys this product immensely.. unsure what else to say about it!</li>
            <li> i bought this without reading reviews, because i&#x27;ve always loved the way it smells on guys. it&#x27;s a gift for my brother. tonight i happened to see how many people were saying it&#x27;s fake and got worried. opened it up and it looks and smells fine to me. if you google curve, you&#x27;ll see that a lot of the photos of the tins don&#x27;t say claiborne on them. i don&#x27;t think that indicates fake, because it&#x27;s like that all over the web. they must have dropped that from the packaging. so i guess you could end up with a fake, but i&#x27;d buy from this seller again based on shipping time, price, packaging and what seems to be authentic to me.</li>
            <li> Love the Curve Cologne Spray by Liz Claiborne.  Have been a returning customer.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last all day like the more expensive colognes but does last a solid 4-5 hours.  I always get complimented when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Very manly and sensual with a smell all of its own.  It smells like a very very exclusive scent that is classy and long lasting, but not overpowering,</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with curve.</li>
            <li> I have been using Curve for about 9 years now and I&#x27;m hooked it smells so great, and girls seem to love it too and they can be picky at times but I have never had a problem with this cologne it&#x27;s the best out there hands down.</li>
            <li> Very rich perfume I like for my partner&lt;br /&gt; The only bad thing was that the lid of the container came beaten and this was a gift</li>
            <li> smells great, great price.  wish they had option to buy without can, no need for that, i just toss it anyway.</li>
            <li> This Cologne Smells Incredible!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women absolutely LOVVVVE IT!!!  I get at least 1 or 2 compliments every time I wear it somewhere new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Price is Incredible!  Much better than the local stores and malls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My orders always arrive very quickly, and very well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the GREAT WORK Guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You all are my Go To Company for Fragrances now.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and i do recommend anyone to buy this product, i put a little bit around my body and then put on my clothes, boy do i&lt;br /&gt;smell great, you should try it, but if you don&#x27;t like it then don&#x27;t buy it, and if you do like it, well you know the rest.&lt;br /&gt;thank you for reading my review.</li>
            <li> Always happy with this product smell Awesome and my husband loves it too ;)</li>
            <li> On time and what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great smell, lasts long , and get loads  of compliments,. I even like it better than some of the Armani colognes.</li>
            <li> Love the smell... i can&#x27;t stop wearing it....</li>
            <li> Got delivered in a huge box lols. but super quick.. great product. Been using it aimce high school.</li>
            <li> Love the product. I am still using it because of the exceptional smell.  My wife loves it.  I will most definately go through Amazon for future purchases.</li>
            <li> This deal was awesome! It&#x27;s hard in this economy to spend alot in cologne, but deals like this really helps!</li>
            <li> The seller seems very nice and there were issues beyond their control in the shipping.  They&#x27;ve been kind enough to offer me a refund on my shipping, but it was in exchange for removal of my negative feedback.  I am disappointed in the product as well though, so I can&#x27;t change my feedback.  My husband had a bottle of the real stuff and we compared.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a half hour in our bottle we just got here.  The real stuff lasts for hours.  Really disappointed because I thought I was getting a good deal.  Instead, I got a fake.  I replied to the e-mail I got from the seller, only to get a response requesting to removed my previous negative feedback.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think that people who are selling knockoffs should be allowed to sell on here pretending it&#x27;s the real stuff.  So, even though they were polite in being willing to refund my shipping, I can&#x27;t remove my negative feedback.  They have falsely advertised the product and they&#x27;ve had multiple negative feedback out of it.  Amazon isn&#x27;t paying attention to it, and many people have gotten a product they aren&#x27;t happy with.  Either sell the real deal, or don&#x27;t pretend that you are.</li>
            <li> This smells SO good &amp; delivery was fast! The price was better here than at Target and they didn&#x27;t have this larger size. I wound up returning the small bottle to the store &amp; keeping this to give as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS POOR QUALITY WATERED DOWN DON&#x27;T BUY&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT IS POOR QUALITY WATERED DOWN DON&#x27;T BUY&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT IS POOR QUALITY WATERED DOWN DON&#x27;T BUY&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT IS POOR QUALITY WATERED DOWN DON&#x27;T BUY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO RETURNS EITHER - NO SCENT -WORST  I EVER BOUGHT - 20 SPRAYS  LAST 0NE MINUTE&lt;br /&gt;20 SPRAYS  LAST 0NE MINUTE !&lt;br /&gt;20 SPRAYS  LAST 0NE MINUTE !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES YOU CAN NOT SMELL ANYTHING ONE MINUTE LATER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I BEEN RIPPED OFF- ROBBED ON HARD EARNED MONEY !!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;THIS WAS SOLD BY AMAZON - NO RETURNS - LEARN THAT AFTER FACT !!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT HAZARD MATERIAL! NO RETURNS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU BEEN WARNED !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought another curve like 5 moths ago and i like it love it  i mean i been using it for about 2 yrs now. but i recently bought this one and it smell gud and everything but the thing is that i belive it is fake maybe is not but i belive it is since the smell dont last like the other curves i had had &#x3D;/ ,,,,,,,, so i dont know</li>
            <li> Okay, maybe just my wife...but that&#x27;s really all I need :  I have used curve for a long time and I enjoy it.  The only complaint I have is that the last few bottles I have purchased, the sprayer does not put out a good amount and it tends to drip down on my hand.  Other than that...no complaints!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves this scent! I love it too. It&#x27;s a very nice smell, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t get faker than that, the can comes in a different color, the sticker in the bottle is fake, the scent it&#x27;s kinda like it but doesn&#x27;t last that long, it&#x27;s a real shame that amazon sells stuff like that.</li>
            <li> very good, it was a gift and he loves it, is very good smell and and he love it, it was here on time and you could get it ... wont regret</li>
            <li> not real but came fast and smells similar! scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as the real curve</li>
            <li> I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li> I went all over looking to buy Curve and no one had what I wanted.  I like spray bottles and I want more than just an ounce.  Therefore, when I found it on Amazon I immediately purchased it and glad I did exactly what I wanted and Thanks.</li>
            <li> interestingly, the perfume even though looks identical to those from big-box retailers smells different. also, it has less retention power. i have been using curve for a while and can recognize the difference. i suspect if this is a look-alike/fake....</li>
            <li> It just plain smells great - and I Always get a hookup wearing this stuff! its awesome! Don&#x27;t over-do it tho</li>
            <li> I love this smell and receive alot of compliments whenever i wear it. Its definately a classic! and as always, the price is right ;)</li>
            <li> Curve is my favorite fragrance, so I have to keep a couple bottles around. I recommend it to anyone that wants a nice, refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent on men.  You can&#x27;t go wrong by sending this as a gift.  Only problem I had was sending it directly to Michigan.  For some reason I ended up receiving it in CA and having to remail.</li>
            <li> It smells about the same on any guy. Classic yes, but my husband still gets random people ask what kind of cologne is he wearing. Am I love the way it smells too.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! It smells amazing. I have been buying it for my boyfriend for years. He thinks it&#x27;s a gift for him but it&#x27;s really a gift for me :)</li>
            <li> first off...... i did get my money refunded by Amazon.....but if anyone else receives a fake after this...then it is only due to amazon not following thru with their vendor.....it is not as pictured in add....the Claiborne wording  is missing from the box and bottle....if you follow the website link on the back of the box....it takes you to a website that is not affiliated in any way with Claiborne. I found several websites stating that Amazon is losing its reputation with colognes due to so many knock off items being received and not the real material ordered....buyer beware**************</li>
            <li> fresh smell...love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the steady parts of my cologne collection which I always keep 16 bottles in stock. This is not an expensive item neither a unique item but it is a wonderful cologne with a mild, lovely sweet scent. I have been using it for years and it is well worth the price. It is good to have it amongst your favorites.</li>
            <li> This scent is very good without any strong peculiar scent that may turn some off.  I think this would make a solid addition to anyones collection.  FYI:  I like Chrome, Chrome Legend, Kenneth Cole reaction, Touch, Black, Lucky.  So if you like those, you will like this particular Curve.  Curve are all different so don&#x27;t discount the whole lineup if you happen to dislike one.</li>
            <li> I know what curve smell like and you sold me a knock-off you thief. give me my money back and stop taking advantage off people.GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or what but the scent is very weak compared to any I have bought before.</li>
            <li> I am a full CURVE guy!! And now even my kids are following in my footsteps after lots of occasions of coughing them spraying my own. Finally thought it was time to get them their own....</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and in the department stores I have always paid $25 more for it.  This is all he wears so I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Great price, quick shipping, and item as described - Thanks!</li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s curve... original scent... is my favorite scent to smell on my husband. When he wears this.... I follow him around the house. It&#x27;s that good. So naturally when he runs out of cologne... I refill his stash. This stuff rocks. Buy it!- Just do it!</li>
            <li> Definitely a feeling that this is a reproduction.  I don&#x27;t remember the tin it comes in being a greenish tint.  No where on the bottle or tin does it say Liz Claiborne, except for a sticker that anyone could have placed on the bottom of the tin.  A sticker on the bottle itself that says &#x27;Curve&#x27; which I don&#x27;t remember being a sticker when I used this in the past.  It doesn&#x27;t smell awful and actually lasted for about 5 hours, as I sprayed it on my arm to test it when first recieving it and then mowed a couple of lawns and it remained.  Not the best smelling, but for a low price it is not bad compared to paying $100+ for much less volume of name brands nowadays.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent since it first came out. It has always been a major part of my cologne selections and the SO loves it (so does everyone else ;).</li>
            <li> This cologne is more expensive than I&#x27;ve seen it, but it was for a Christmas gift, so I paid the price.</li>
            <li> my sons favorite cologne. he loves this and he loves chrome. he really enjoys smelling good. only 15 years old</li>
            <li> I really love this scent of cologne.  Best for teens and young adults...I have had several people comment on how good it smells.  The only issue I had was the time it took to ship.</li>
            <li> GREATGREAT, PERSON LOVED IT FOR CHRISTMAS GREAT GIFT, WOULD GIVE AS A GIFT AGAIN AND AGAIN THANKS&lt;br /&gt;WOULD ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> Curve comes out of the bottle with notes of floral, spice, and woods.  Definitely a masculine fragrance.  It finishes with notes of powder and evergreen.  Very pleasant and easy on the nose.  While their are similar fragrances out there, Curve offers a slight variation, making it slightly unique and pleasant.  Curve offers above average projection and sillage.  The longevity of the fragrance is also above average, lasting six (6) to eight (8) hours on the skin and even longer on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot;, for the price it can not be matched.  While not every time worn, but on many occasions I have received compliments from hotties (I mean the opposite sex - don&#x27;t tell Sweetie I made that comment..).  It has potential.. Obviously, I am a fan.  The real beauty of Curve is the price/value and versatility.  The current rate on Amazon is a little over $25 for a large bottle - with free shipping.  Curve can be worn any time of year - maybe Fall works best - any occasion and day or night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is above average and I am digging the metal boxes - a little extra cushion if you keep and use for travel.  While the bottle is nothing more than average, I do like the clip prohibiting spraying unless removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Curve is 4.4 stars out of 5 stars.  I like it and recommend adding to your collection.  The fragrance is fantastic and for the money - go for it.. Be a leader today and change the world...</li>
            <li> Excelente marca. Recibi en muy buen estado. Estoy conforme con el mismo, y por tanto, he recomendado a mis amigos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this still smells like the original stuff I had before it.  What follows is an explanation of how it&#x27;s not branded by Liz Clairborne, but is licensed by them and still a legitimate product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my product, based on other reviews I had seen, I looked for &amp;#34;Liz Clairborne&amp;#34; labeling, as there was on my previous bottle.  It&#x27;s not there, but I did find on the can the legal notice saying, &amp;#34;CURVE IS A TRADEMARK OF LCI AND IS USED UNDER LICENSE.&amp;#34;  Beyond that it says it&#x27;s made in USA and distributed by &amp;#34;EA Fragrances Co.&amp;#34; in NYC, which evidently also has a basis in London.  They have a website of &amp;#34;getcurve&amp;#34; .com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick google search reveals that this really is the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Curve cologne, as it got moved over to &amp;#34;EA&amp;#34; as above in 2009.  So it&#x27;s not a scam--the original company just delegated it out.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and enjoy the scent.  However, a little does go a long way since it can be fairly powerful.</li>
            <li> Love it and smells good, I would by this again.</li>
            <li> Smell&#x27;s really good. great for men and teenager&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Perfect stocking stuffer for less than the store price!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery...great product...great price</li>
            <li> my husband very happy with this perfume. come with good fixator. during approximately 8 hrs.  It has a sensual and sweet aromatic smell. Thanks Amazon and Seller.</li>
            <li> Good subtle hint of fragrance. Not overwhelming, doesn&#x27;t pinpoint you in a crowd&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for a good gift</li>
            <li> The fragrance wont even last for 30 mins hope amazon wont encourage this kind of generic products. .. ! !</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas. Came intact with no issues what so ever. He enjoys wearing it and I enjoy it, as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and he uses it everyday. It smells amazing and everyone complements him when he wears it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing curve since 1999 (this exact type). This batch that I received literally has no scent to it. I can spray 5~6 times before I start to smell anything.&lt;br /&gt;On any other curve that I&#x27;ve ever purchased, it takes 1~2 sprays...that would last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what happened, but pretty disappointed in this order.</li>
            <li> I bougt Curve for my boyfriend. He loves it so do I!!!  It&#x27;s a great gift with the reusable tin.</li>
            <li> My grandson loved it.</li>
            <li> The ladies love it....!</li>
            <li> I have been using Curve for many years, now. Women love it and men even compliment it, too.</li>
            <li> great buy and find too</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before. I knew wha to expect. my husband likes it too.&lt;br /&gt;no problems at all.</li>
            <li> The smell is so smelly it smelled a certain smell all over me and it smelled like a smell I&#x27;d never smelt</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne and I was able to have it shipped straight to my door for a price better than driving to the retail store to get it!</li>
            <li> great smell, and will always be a favorite! I would order another bottle of cologne some time soon! thanks again guys!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. I get so many compliments on it. I just love it. I bought the shower gel and deodorant. It all works great.</li>
            <li> i smelled this some where before. and from what i can smell its pretty damn good. so i sent it as a gift to my bf</li>
            <li> I know scent is entirely subjective. But I&#x27;ve worn a handful of different scents in my adult life, and I&#x27;ve never had random strangers compliment me on one I&#x27;ve worn until Curve.</li>
            <li> It was OK but nothing to brag about. The smell didnot last long. I donot think  the price  was worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells Great On my husband! He loves wearing it and I love him wearing it. And Amazon beats Walmart on price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Curve for over 10 years and still enjoy using it as much as I did back then.  It has a powerful but not overwhelming scent that goes great for casual events or just a day at the office.  Hopefully this fragrance sticks around for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Thank you so much quick delivery smells so good and it&#x27;s such a good cologne... I&#x27;ve been wearing it since high school</li>
            <li> Love this frag.  Was a big hit in late 90s!&lt;br /&gt;Had to go old school for a while!  Had to hit up again.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years.  I can&#x27;t even really smell it anymore because I have become so accustomed to the smell.  But I still get complements and my fiancee likes it best so I still continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought Curve was about 12or 14 years ago. I liked it then and I still like it. Plus its a Very good price on Amazon. Not so sure its the real thing though!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my fiance. This is the new version of the Cologne by EA NOT Liz Claiborne. I notice the scent is not as strong as the original and fades much sooner. Still, I&#x27;ll give it four stars because the price is great for 4.2 fl. Oz.</li>
            <li> Dear Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered numerous items from you before, and have trusted your products up until now, this \\&quot;Curve by Liz Claiborne for Men - 4.2 Ounce Cologne Spray\\&quot; i got today, is certainly NOT the product advertised!!! it is a VERY cheap KNOCK OFF, i am very disappointed and would really like a refund of some sort, also you should probably remove the label you have for this item..as it is NOT curve by Liz Claiborne, i&#x27;d expect these types of products from a random street hustler, not Amazon.com LLC</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten some nice compliments from both girls and guys mostly girls about how good the cologne smells on me. Cheap and it last for about 5-6 hours. So 2-3 sprays should do. Try it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my brother he likes this cologne I would not find the gift set at my local Target like last yr so I know I over paid but saved the gas money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this same cologne for the last 5 years and it&#x27;s quality hasn&#x27;t diminished one bit. Will more than likely where it for another 5+ and beyond. Plus my girlfriend loves it ;-D</li>
            <li> smell doesn&#x27;t last like it used to. seemed water down a bit.</li>
            <li> Please listen to me when I tell you I received a fake. I read the reviews about it not being legit but didn&#x27;t want to believe it so I ordered it anyway. First of all the word curve is stuck in the bottle like a label. It&#x27;s engraved or etched on the real thing. It smells very similar but the smell is gone within minutes no matter how much I spray on. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> my husband love it. He just love the way it smell on him. And so does every one else. It might not work for every one.</li>
            <li> This item I have purchased for my husband numerous times. Smells nice, not to over powering. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great smell, love it on my hubby</li>
            <li> My guy enjoy this got it at a good price and smell so good</li>
            <li> This is always a cologne i keep stocked up on for my husband! I love it</li>
            <li> I love this cologne it has a light scent but smells amazing. I have been using the same cologne for years and just keep repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> Its a cologne that I have been using for years and I love the smell of this stuff. Its much cheaper than Wal-mart</li>
            <li> After using the bottle of Curve I received from Amazon for the first time this morning, I am absolutely mortified! This is not the same Curve I&#x27;ve been ordering for the past two or three years from Amazon. It doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour or two. I am absolutely floored!!!! I will never order another bottle of Curve on Amazon ever again. I am absolutely speechless that Amazon would carry or allow its sellers to carry fakes. I read in a few reviews that Elizabeth Arden now produces the Curve cologne line. If the formula has been changed recently, then shame on Liz Claiborne and Elizabeth Arden. It&#x27;s so hard to find a cologne that works with your individual chemistry. I have been using Curve for over ten years. All good things...</li>
            <li> todo bien excelente vendedor me llego lo solicitado y en perfectas condiciones.</li>
            <li> I love how affordable it was and it smells AMAZING!!! It came on time and made for a wonderful surprise present for my brother :)</li>
            <li> If you think it is too good to be true..well it is..my husband has worn this cologne for years... no way in Hell this is the real deal..It was delivered today and thrown in the trash! I am disgusted by Amazon! and yes it was sold and shipped by Amazon</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Have been told by many how nice it smells on me.</li>
            <li> my 22 year old son loves it and loves the size of the product.  It will last him for a while!</li>
            <li> been wearing this for years and always get compliments on how it smells.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son - he loves the Curve cologne and this purchase was easy, fast and a great value!</li>
            <li> I get the, You Smell Good! when women come by me. If you wonder what to try, try this one, it is a good buy</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne thinking I was getting a great price and I get it delivered to my house and this bottle and box that it came in did not look like any bottle of curve that I have previously purchased and then I find out that this product isn&#x27;t even an authentic cologne, I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Really great cologne. Lasts forever!</li>
            <li> great price smell good</li>
            <li> Way to strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Curve. Classic.</li>
            <li> I am not too impressed by this</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great and is stronger than the other curve colognes that are available for a lower price here on amazon. worth the extra few bucks for the stronger and nice and smell.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this scent for years and still get complimented on it often. The waitresses at work and female family members always say it smells great. Lasts a long time too! Two quick sprays to either side of my shirt (I don&#x27;t apply to the skin) and I&#x27;m good for the day.</li>
            <li> This is a consistently nice smelling cologne. I receive a ton of compliments and never give away the secret that it is an affordable cologne.</li>
            <li> Love this cologn. My husband has been wearing it for 15 years and it still draws me in. Nice that it costs less than many other brands too.</li>
            <li> What a good produce. i use it all the time.It shipped very fast and was at my door in no time.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Claiborne fragrances for 20 years and curve is a staple for me. Not too strong and not too subtle.</li>
            <li> The strength is very weak compared to previous examples of the same product I have purchased. It honestly seems as if it&#x27;s watered down to me.  I purchased for convenience but honestly I will procure from a retail store next time to ensure quality - a shame and unfortunately disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great smell, mediocre longevity. Curve has a strong, yet very tolerable masculine smell. Everyone always comments and loves it. Wish the cologne would last longer though.</li>
            <li> One can never go wrong with Curve for men.  This pricing was better than any we could find on the web.  We will order again.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted and at a fabulous price.  Purchased as a gift and it was not a disappointment</li>
            <li> Not only do I love this scent (&amp; it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite, too) but this was the best price around for it!  Thanks, Amazon.com, once again you have a more than satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> It has become my signature since my then girlfriend (now wife) gifted it to me 13 years back. I keep buying it again and again,</li>
            <li> And I love the way he smells with it and oh I love the fact that when he leaves, the sheets smell just like him. We would have it no other way !!!</li>
            <li> Got me all da bitches , yass</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this since high school and every one of my female freinds love this. I&#x27;ve had complimants from complete strangers . Buyer for life</li>
            <li> I have been using Curve for at least 20 years and it&#x27;s one of the best products I have used.  Always presents a clean and woderful aroma.  My wife loves it.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with Curve!</li>
            <li> A classic cologne never fails, long lasting cologne the best!</li>
            <li> Got it for a friend for his birthday and was so excited. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good price for a big bottle of it. It was a gift, so the person i got it for was happy</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and it was a GREAT buy!  Would definitely recommend to others.  Shipment time was great too.</li>
            <li> Great price, quick shipping</li>
            <li> as other reviewers say, this product is fake.&lt;br /&gt;i was furious because i cannot believe amazon would sell a fake product.&lt;br /&gt;However, i went to target later on and the curve they had for display also had the curve sticker on it.&lt;br /&gt;Which made me wonder if the  cologne i got was really a fake.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to sale you how great this product is but the shipping is quick.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m partial but I absolutely LOVE this cologne. My fiance wore this when we were just friends. He still wears it just not as much. It&#x27;s not too heavy and overpowering. It&#x27;s definitely one of those that you can distinctly tell the difference from other colognes. It can be somewhat expensive. As with all colognes/perfumes I&#x27;d recommend buying the smallest version, testing it then come to final conclusion about item.</li>
            <li> I have bought this cologne at Department stores and I loved it. I noticed the smell does not last more than a few hours. I usually spray about 3-4 sprays. I have to spray this one like 10 sprays for it to last all day. Very strange to me and I my girlfriend noticed the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years. I keep it in my rotation as my daily scent because I don&#x27;t get tired of it and it&#x27;s not heavy over powering and musky. It is a medium scent good for time of year and I get compliments all the time. It&#x27;s a cheap great smelling Cologne that is good enough for daily use .</li>
