            <li>Love this perfume smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s aquatic and strong and all around a good scent.</li>
            <li>very mild good for summer time/day time use</li>
            <li>Great deal- shipped quickly</li>
            <li>It is a nice, fresh, happy smell; but try it on to see how it suits your skin.</li>
            <li>and then I switched to Versace, which I think is a fair bit more sexy.  </li>
            <li>i have a very strong sense of smell..  </li>
            <li>and I love it even more!  </li>
            <li>the smell is amazing and you will get many compliments.</li>
            <li>It is the most amazing scent ever.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Versace fragrance out there!!</li>
            <li>Really nice scent, without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best scent on the market.</li>
            <li>However, if you buy directly from Amazon, you can expect superb results.</li>
            <li>I think it adds a very nice touch and makes a man smell like he is clean and elegant instead of a ragtag</li>
            <li>Original and good</li>
            <li>Not only is this cologne one of the best scents I have ever purchased, but the shipping time was amazing and the email updates were prompt.</li>
            <li>This cologne definitely deserves 5 stars for its great smell, and great value.</li>
            <li>Very nice using it right</li>
            <li>I love the scent, but even one spray seems to be VERY strong.  </li>
            <li>This item had a really good price for the size, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this item was or is the original thing.</li>
            <li>Great deal and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Great Value, Shipped on Time and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, I really like, and my wife too, the smell is fresh, citric, as a summer fragrance while remaining elegant, excellent choice!!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, good price.</li>
            <li>This was not the first time I buy this cologne and definitely won&#x27;t be the last.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for their great service and awesome</li>
            <li>Very light, more of a summer day scent.</li>

            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I saw many reviews that most of these are counterfeit, but still ended up getting on.</li>
            <li>I experienced it for real this time.</li>
            <li>the item as described, even better for me.  </li>
            <li>I tend to lean toward &amp;#34;light fruity citrus&amp;#34; type colognes, but as soon as I tested this one i fell in love.</li>
            <li>This smell is more musty and the smell dies out within 30 minutes.</li>

            <li>Definitely in my top 5.  </li>

            <li>but with a more manly and aquatic scent.</li>
            <li>so I can make sure the smell is OK.  </li>
            <li>I pay more for it at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom -</li>
            <li>I was so glad that I found it here</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to just go ahead and buy it from the department store.</li>

            <li>One of my favorite cologne,would order it again....</li>
            <li>Been wearing this for 5+ years now and it&#x27;s still my favorite cologne.  </li>

            <li>excellent was better than I expected arrived quicker than expected great compliments on the smellit&#x27;s my great surprise that also came with a shower gel</li>
            <li>etcm that this one of the best smelling colognes they&#x27;ve ever smelled , its a very fresh clean cut smell that lasts long people notice the smell at a good distance .</li>
            <li>It mimics the casing that it comes in being very clean with a hint of femininity.</li>
            <li>All of my fragrance purchases from them directly have been PERFECT, authentic and fresh juice.  </li>
            <li>Loved it the first day I smelled it.</li>

            <li>It has a warm, fruity, mildly spicy scent that works well for all seasons.  </li>

            <li>The product smells fantastic, its my husbands favorite scent.</li>
            <li>i can safely advise anyone wishing to clarify the products&#x27; authenticity that it is genuine.</li>
            <li>He loved it so much &amp; used it all.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good and the price was so much cheaper than buying from a department store.</li>
            <li>Eau Fraiche is another nice fresh scent...</li>
            <li>very fresh, sophisticated smell.</li>
            <li>It quickly catapulted itself to my favorite cologne of his (and he has many).</li>
            <li>This is just a classic cologne by Versace, its light, its refreshing, good in the summer or winter.</li>
            <li>Always appreciated and the wonderful smell never gets old!</li>
            <li>But this one seems to fade away very quickly.</li>
            <li>There has been some criticism that Man Eau Fraiche cologne fades easily -</li>
            <li>, I get compliments all the time on how nice I smell and the ladies love it haha.</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as I thought.</li>
            <li>females stop you and be real loud and say um you smell good.</li>
            <li>It is light and fades in scent easily, however.</li>
            <li>Cool &amp; refreshing &amp; light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; easy to wear anytime...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne, and with my bottle quickly drying up, I decided to see what Amazon could offer.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>So clean and professional, can&#x27;t wait to purchase more!!</li>
            <li>buy it for my husband and I am delighted with this perfume smell is wonderful, last long and everyone around you feel it.</li>
            <li>It smells very crisp and refreshing, like a man should.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strong or overwhelming but just right.</li>
            <li>cheap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, yet manly.</li>
            <li>bam, here it is with the 2 day free shipping with my amazon prime.</li>
            <li>Cheap synthetic spoiled smelling &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>Now I have the hassle of returning a product which should have been authentic and fresh to begin with.</li>
            <li>It smells GREAT once sprayed, but the fragrance is gone minutes later.  </li>
            <li>It smells light</li>
            <li>Fresh, aquatic fragrance with Lemon and lime top notes</li>
            <li>I am very picky and own 50+ fragrances.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely authentic and worth a purchase.</li>
            <li>Great scent that lasts and will definitely get you compliments!  </li>
            <li>but i got it in the mail today and its the real thing, and not to mention it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I got this for my girlfriend to enjoy it on me.</li>
            <li>Amazon delivered great service at an amazingly low price.  </li>
            <li>Even though it wasn&#x27;t prime eligible, it did offer free shipping, so I took the plunge without reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my primary go-to.</li>
            <li>Seems genuine.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells fantastic-</li>
            <li>I enjoy it every time i use it.</li>
            <li>I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment.</li>
            <li>I sound like a man.</li>
            <li>Bottle &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; cheap and plastic</li>
            <li>i bought it years ago and loved it 6-7 years later i still love this scent.</li>
            <li>It is a great bottle, even though it&#x27;s made out of plastic, and sprays very well, but if you tend to have drier skin where fragrances just don&#x27;t have the sillage required to wear all day in the office or a day out, I really can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>the fragrances are not quite the same as the ones I sample in Sephora, I do think this one is the authentic since it has a serial number and all, but the smell is not as good</li>
            <li>The bottle itself looks effectively identical to the bottle I own, with the exception of a serial number sticker being in a slightly different place.  </li>
            <li>Only con is it is not CH Chic or Armani Code; honestly you should look at buying one of those two before you look here.(They are well liked).</li>
            <li>Everything good so far</li>
            <li>and the price was great- better than the other sites I went to.</li>
            <li>Smells great, the packaging was all original and it came the very next day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the real Parfum! !!</li>
            <li>haha, I PROMISE!!!</li>
            <li>It was the REAL THING!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very fresh manly fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent gives a very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I will order a second bottle soon because it will be a great gift to someone special</li>
            <li>They are usually among the best smelling, and maintain their scent (they don&#x27;t morph into smelling like a cheap musky product).  </li>
            <li>Nice, fresh, crisp smell.  </li>
            <li>This is my boyfriends new favorite cologne and mine too, and I can&#x27;t stop smelling him!</li>
            <li>amazing high end designer fragrance.</li>
            <li>and i enjoyed it very much at the time.</li>
            <li>Amazing product super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Its a great smell, lasts long too.</li>
            <li>The smell was 100% better and that one spray lasted me the whole day through night!</li>
            <li>Its definitively unique</li>
            <li>The cologne came in the original box sealed with plastic shrink wrap.</li>
            <li>if you want an original cologne or perfume go to a department store or an authorized seller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an original brand by Versace they won&#x27;t produce something like that.</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Perfume was not an Original one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and smells great, what else could you want.  </li>
            <li>The Versace Man Eau Fraiche is probably the best cologne I&#x27;v used so far and this is definitely gonna be a keeper.</li>
            <li>Best kept secret, I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments as this cologne.</li>
            <li>Best smelling cologne for a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like an old man, and doesn&#x27;t want to over power the entire room with their scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this of course reminds me a lot of clean water with a hint of floral.</li>
            <li>thats super cheap,</li>
            <li>I received it the next day and the full cologne came with the shower gel as a set which was an amazing surprise!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it to clean my windows just to see...</li>
            <li>There are not a lot of mens colognes that I like but this one smells clean, not fruity or over baring.  </li>
            <li>It is not overly woody, but a clean scent.  </li>
            <li>It is actually quite pleasant to look at</li>
            <li>It has a very clean and crisp smell that is almost aquatic.</li>
            <li>Super fast shippment and its 100 % authentic as I checked it on available sites used for this purpose.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to throw a quick review of this handsome set that I received, which included the 3.4oz spray and a 3.4oz shower gel / body wash in a nice travel set box, for only paying for a 3.4oz bottle.</li>

            <li>love it just pure awesomeness</li>
            <li>When looking for something special for my son for Christmas, my husband suggested this cologne.</li>
            <li>for refunding me my money right away!</li>
            <li>my best advice is to always try it first on your skin and wait a few hours to see what it does.</li>
            <li>Highway robbery, this is not the real thing, more alcohol than anything else.</li>
            <li>Such a good deal.  </li>
            <li>The scent is modern and sophisticated without being overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Gotta keep myself smelling sweet.</li>
            <li>but overall it was quite good.</li>
            <li>I have liked others but by far this is my favorite out others, there have been some real bombs.</li>
            <li>Italians are good for clothes and French are the people to make colognes.</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I just double checked the shirt, and it smells good as I would expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>100% authentic and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My husband always wears Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>Constantly get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>Non offensive and most people will find it very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>I decided that I would just go to a department store and pay the full price.</li>
            <li>It last all day, good projection without killing people.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price out of any other store for this particular scent.</li>
            <li>This is a smooth slightly synthetic blend of apples, citrus and tea notes with great longevity and projection.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is strong enough that I can use one spray, although I think it helps that I&#x27;m in a warm climate.  </li>
            <li>The first use was strong and I received comments at work.  </li>
            <li>I am a little upset because I love a good strong crisp cologne.</li>
            <li>Its unique and like a powder, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>This cologne was far above my expectations very very good</li>
            <li>Always smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>And smell so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cologne for my husband and I not only love the scent but love the price.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and was factory sealed when i opened it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you purchased this from a department store it would smell completely different (better).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back when he needs more.</li>
            <li>the problem is it dissipates quickly</li>
            <li>At two reputable locations I noticed the same differences with my all time favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I feel as if the smell goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>it came right on time and it came in the original box.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you like refreshing colognes</li>
            <li>I would just like to say that he loves it so very much!</li>
            <li>I first bought this cologne in the duty free shop when we were on our way home from Paris for a birthday gift.  </li>
            <li>I loved it then and can&#x27;t remember why I waited so long to buy it again.  </li>
            <li>, that instead not only was that 3.4oz bottle included, but it was tucked away nicely inside of complete Versace travel set, with bonus 3.4oz shower gel in a nicely appointed box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great but starts dying down like an hour afterwards.</li>
            <li>For some that&#x27;s great because they prefer a faded, more subtle smell.</li>
            <li>Brand new and sealed 100% satisfied</li>
            <li>This was a gift to my nephew who wanted it more than a new car.  </li>
            <li>I been using different types of cologne for a long time, but this cologne is simply amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>The scent seems ok on first test, but I am very suspicious.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful scent which is not overpowering and seems to last all day long.  </li>
            <li>and I just want to confirm that it is real ,not a fake ,as many are writing here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragance is similar to that of dolce gab light blue just not as strong which is better, I think this perfume should be unisex though because i use it all the time :)</li>
            <li>smells great and lasts a long time, highly reccomend</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would totally recommend this amazing perfum.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and is a real lady killer</li>
            <li>Great price, everything as expected, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Really good scent as expected.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cooling, fresh, watery and chill.</li>
            <li>my friend liked it when I gave it to him as a present.</li>
            <li>id only used hollister and AE and coolwater and diesel before this, but honestly, versace puts them to shame.</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace the D&amp;G Light Blue I used up, but chose this instead, and I am enjoying it.</li>
            <li>This was definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and last all day.</li>
            <li>This is fresh and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>The aroma is fresh, it&#x27;s sensual, exciting.  </li>
            <li>17 yr old said all the girls love it on him.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment, Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>i dont know what else to say other that it smells good</li>
            <li>In the right smel.</li>
            <li>Came right on time</li>
            <li>Opened the box and the cologne did not smell right.  </li>
            <li>right time as described</li>
            <li>also the price was great, much cheaper than in any other store!</li>
            <li>The bottle is a cool design and it&#x27;s a decent size for the price!</li>
            <li>It has a soft clean smell!</li>
            <li>Was a gift for a friend, yes would recommend this for men who like a crisp fresh wood smell.</li>
            <li>Not too strong but not too soft.</li>
            <li>Came super duper fast, was freaking out cause I bought it a Week before valentines day</li>
            <li>Great big box for a big bottle.</li>
            <li>Its a very soft scent with a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m typically a Nautica, Cool Water, Chrome, Boucheron, Tommy, CK kind of guy.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong but its enough to catch attention and it gives a whif of summer freshness its like a sweet citrusy smell.</li>
            <li>I like the scent very much.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect scent for a hot summer day, it&#x27;s casual and fresh, and pretty versatile for the type of scent</li>
            <li>One little spritz is all I need every morning, and I am good for the day.</li>
            <li>Bought this from amazon.com first time i ever bought a fragrance off amazon.</li>
            <li>The bottle was exactly like the one in the store and it smells just like it</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I want the first one</li>
            <li>As with all fragrances, it pays to try it on first.</li>
            <li>The first one that I received was tampered with.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have bought cologne from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is my second time buying it for my boyfriend because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this is the reason my current gf is with me...</li>
            <li>first impression of the product was that it reminded me of the ocean.</li>
            <li>However, I found that it does wonders in intimate situations where you don&#x27;t really want to give someone a nose full of musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product smells as if it wasn&#x27;t 100% authentic, I bought same product from Macys before, and the one from Macys smells stronger.</li>
            <li>but i want one that smells really great last long all day no matter</li>
            <li>I found this to be remarkably similar to Versace Por Homme, but maybe a bit lighter and more summer oriented.  </li>
            <li>Really like this!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Italian perfumes and this one is of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and packaged well!</li>
            <li>The first day I ha it</li>
            <li>Whether you struggle to see this on your first wearing, give it time.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to order name brand cologne from amazon.  </li>
            <li>But after finishing his first bottle of Man, he requested another for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I love this smell, It also last for some time a couple of days to exact.</li>
            <li>And I was so satisfied with the big size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>The value appeared to be off the charts, with a 3.4 oz (100 mL) bottle costing only $6 more than the 1.7 oz (50 mL) bottle.  </li>
            <li>He had compliments from 2 females the first night he wore it.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this item before, this is my first time buying online</li>
            <li>Never fails to get compliments when im out.</li>
            <li>Any man who wants to turn on a woman must get this!</li>
            <li>so I will see how it smells during hot summer days.</li>
            <li>and when it&#x27;s 60 degrees without much variation in the results.&lt;br /&gt;But, on some people, this fragrance sticks to their skin for DAYS!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The cologne was exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li>is my first time buying Versace cologne for myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure something got mixed up somewhere, but for once I got a bonus in my shipment!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure something got mixed up somewhere, but for once I got a bonus in my shipment!</li>
            <li>And the price was reasonable too!</li>
            <li>save your money and buy it from Macy&#x27;s because it will only cost you 10-20 dollars more</li>
            <li>My first time purchase of this cologne.</li>
            <li>If you are used to this fragrance, the formula appears to have changed to a weaker and more diluted version of its former self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is your first time buying this fragrance</li>
            <li>This was exactly what my husband wanted</li>
            <li>I will gladly pay the extra money to buy this at a department store from now on</li>
            <li>The scent stays and lasts a very long time which is a great quality when you like the scent obviously.</li>
            <li>He is very sensitive to perfumes/colognes, most of them make him sneeze and give him a headache,  so far this one hasn&#x27;t bothered him at all.</li>
            <li>My husband works around other people so it is important that his cologne not be too strong.</li>
            <li>Somewhere between a sport and powder, this scent is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>What else can I say ladies love, it young and old.</li>
            <li>The packaging also goes hand in hand with the scent of the unit which is very blissful but more about that later.</li>
            <li>I Just love this cologne spray it last for the whole 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Lol I read the other reviews and I can say exactly the same thing about girls and this cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong, only one spray will get me through the day.</li>
            <li>Not strong just a nice fresh smell</li>
            <li>I like the way it smells and have heard nothing but positive feedback.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal - not a fake.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;re safe buying fragranaces from Amazon as long as they&#x27;re $25 dollars and under...</li>
            <li>It is real, not fake.</li>
            <li>however it does smell pretty close to the real thing</li>
            <li>It was packaged perfectly to prevent damage, brand new still wrapped, and took less time to send than expected.</li>
            <li>Spice\\&quot; Its light and fresh but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Only need 1 or 2 sprays and lasts hours without having an overly strong scent.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The very first moment after the scent of this cologne went up my nose, and processed by my brain, I felt complete.</li>
            <li>it&#x60;s smell nice and fresh and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I think this scent is similar, but refreshing and new.  </li>
            <li>The moment I tried this cologne it smells like pure alcohol with the slightest hint of the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thank you Versace for making a big, chubby, and sweaty man a little more appealing.</li>
            <li>I really wish Amazon would stop using UPS.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>If one wants to smell like my YRNs &amp;#34;The Migos&amp;#34;, One must buy this scent.</li>
            <li>The deal couldn&#x27;t be real.</li>
            <li>lady appreciated the cologne and couldn&#x27;t wait for me put it on.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>Fast and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper than the price at retail stores.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I have to conclude that this may not be the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cologne.  </li>
            <li>This was my second purchase so that he could continue to enjoy this cologne.  </li>
            <li>I really like this item,</li>
            <li>the code on the bottom isnt a real versace code.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>im gonna buy another one for myself my dad really like it</li>
            <li>and the scent lasts for the whole day</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>as a college student, I would prefer that it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted a summer</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing</li>
            <li>some times they&#x27;re the real deal</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get cloying at all, overall a well rounded smooth juice.</li>
            <li>and it is the real stuff not a knock off</li>
            <li>This is the real thing ladies and gents.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves the scent</li>
            <li>This cologne IS the real thing, I compared it to a sample I got from Sephora</li>
            <li>He absolutely LOVES IT....</li>
            <li>Came fast and was packed well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft, fresh scent</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really close to the skin.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Amazon sells genuine products and this was not shipped by a 3rd party as others seem to have been reporting that&#x27;s how they were ripped</li>
            <li>This was the real deal.</li>
            <li>I am reviewing the cologne itself that I purchased from Sephora (the real deal).</li>
            <li>that wears too much cologne.</li>
            <li>so much guys</li>
            <li>i really appreciate it</li>
            <li>I am very manly.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>i think it smells like microwaved cat piss, but apparently at least one gorgeous woman does not share that sentiment.</li>
            <li>It has an atmospheric quality to it, this loves warm weather especially if you&#x27;re by water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells good, slow shipping even with prime</li>
            <li>I can tell you it&#x27;s just a light, fun, a little sweet but still masculine scent that I expect to have hoards of women flocking to.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cologne that has a distinct, but subtle smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and so do other people.  </li>
            <li>It is unique enough that people will ask you what you&#x27;re wearing (ie.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to try to describe it because I&#x27;m not really good at it, but it smells so good and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s got a fresh, clean, low key scent if I can just figure out how to not make it permeate through the air so much.</li>
            <li>Overall, the packaging is different from the regular overly masculine perfume containers that we see today that makes themselves look too bold for their own good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, however I don&#x27;t know what it is but half the time I buy from Amazon</li>
            <li>I guess its an older cologne</li>
            <li>This particular one from amazon...</li>
            <li>Very fresh, and scent lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t reccomend it too highly though lest you all steal my scent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is high-end cologne-  highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so I know am getting a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on other colognes, but this by far has received the most.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% not original and just wonder how many customers rated this 5 starts .</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>Now this is by far my front runner of cologne here!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its aged or what but the actual smell isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>After a few more uses, I noticed that I couldn&#x27;t even smell it.  </li>
            <li>Not a loud sweet scent.</li>
            <li>The French definition of \\&quot;Eau Fraiche\\&quot; is \\&quot;fresh water\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Same goes for any woman that wants to be turned on by her man;)</li>
            <li>for 4 stars ,well I didn&#x27;t like the opening and after a while when it is dried out it smells much better, maybe because it is summer fragrance</li>
            <li>I have received very positive remarks from some female colleagues at work while wearing this.  </li>
            <li>The bottle came on time, is NOT old smelling or quick fading, and people like it.(if</li>
            <li>but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorites</li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A NEW COLOGNE.</li>
            <li>New merchandise, not a tester.</li>
            <li>After going out in Chicago&#x27;s Boystown, I knew I needed new cologne ASAP.</li>
            <li>Similar to DG light blue for women...</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I expected and exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li>Very classy scent that stays with you throughout the day but is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Very soft smell but still very masculine.</li>
            <li>The pckaging and bottle looked exactly the same as if I had bought the item at a department store.    </li>
            <li>Well i first smelled this product in my local mall</li>
            <li>First off, let me start off by saying that I am female</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly the same.</li>
            <li>about it has a very unique take on the other blue fragrances out there, just for me it lacked that uniqueness and punch that I was looking for.    </li>
            <li>Went searching for a new cologne after they stopped making my old one.  </li>
            <li>I have used Versace for the last five years, its a good cologne; the package did not have any padding for protection just a piece of brown paper, not good, product was nor damage</li>
            <li>The bottle is nice to, but that is pretty irrelevant.</li>
            <li>scent is soft and smooth and last for a long time, always get complements when I wear it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not look original, the smell does not last long...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually jump on the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; bandwagon, but the first thing that caught my attention was a cheapish loose fitting cap - which led me to look for a matching serial number.  </li>
            <li>My wife agreed with me that it was clearly tampered with.  </li>
            <li>If you ever bought the real thing you&#x27;ll instantly know the difference.</li>
            <li>Old ladies, waitress&#x27;, people in the store have stopped and ask me what I wear.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li>When deciding who to purchase from, I implore you to stick with Amazon.com directly, regardless of price.      </li>
            <li>This stuff drives the gals wild whether I&#x27;m hittin&#x27;</li>
            <li>Not so masculine, but will get you notice.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x60;t bought this fragrance online so far ?</li>
            <li>I have to use twice as much of this to smell it and it does not last all day.</li>
            <li>Well I read some of these and can tell you this in NO way smells like \\&quot;Old</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and was package properly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it, not lasting longer.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh at all and even if you spray it liberally, your colleagues will not complain at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>surprised when I got the package in the mail</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift to my Godson and so far I have not heard any complaints.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived early, I think by a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the product was as described and not an imitations as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>bought this as a gift from amazon.com directly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, yet masculine..........</li>
            <li>I only paid for a 3.4oz bottle of this cologne, and what I got was much</li>
            <li>Well worth the $40 I spent for ot.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but is fake</li>
            <li>You can say I am a ladies man on my college campus, and I always had girls loving the way I smell, but this cologne makes them want me soo bad its funny!!</li>
            <li>the popularity of summer aromatic aquatics has become a little bit redundant from one house to the next,and while this fragrance opens up with a beautiful blend of citrus notes and maybe a touch of lavender, it has absolutely no projection and within two hours disappears.</li>
            <li>Received this item very quickly and when I got it, it was much larger than I expected, this will last my brother in law all year.</li>
            <li>Bought several other colognes but dont have the original to compare, please do not buy.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m not sure if this adulterated product is safe on my skin, there is a definite health concern here as I do not know what this fragrance was \\&quot;cut\\&quot; with!)    </li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m not sure if this adulterated product is safe on my skin, there is a definite health concern here as I do not know what this fragrance was \\&quot;cut\\&quot; with!)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered &amp; expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>The first one, which I ordered, is a light blue bottle whereas the latter one is a dark blue and smells drastically different.</li>
            <li>love this scent for my other half</li>
            <li>Before it was exceptional in both and less \\&quot;woody\\&quot; on the dry down.</li>
            <li>and it was SEXY looking, and the bottle was actually frosty cold, might have to do with the fact its snowy outside XD and when i sprayed it i instantly fell inlove:) smells SO gooooooddddd</li>
            <li>last time when I order this particular item, you sent me a wrong kind of versace which I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li>When I saw this was barely $40, I knew I couldn&#x27;t pass it up!  </li>
            <li>not sure if its the Original....</li>
            <li>/&gt;After noticing the projection and longevity to be significantly diminished in my last few bottles ordered on-line, I gave up.</li>
            <li>What the heck I just got my cologne and it smells like pure alcohol with a super weak scent</li>
            <li>a large cologne spray to last a long time.</li>
            <li>It is subtle to the nose, so the wearer won&#x27;t easily recognize its potency.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on at the store early one morning and the scent stayed on me until the next day...</li>
            <li>I was surprised and concerned to see a number of reviews that suggested that the product was an obvious counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>after several use, it&#x27;d become your natural scent even when you use it.</li>
            <li>First of all those who say it does not last long obviously purchased a counterfeit bottle online.</li>
            <li>(Only because it shipped near me) I couldn&#x27;t be any happier.</li>
            <li>It smells watered down or perhaps it got hot and</li>
            <li>I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li>As with a few other fragrances I have enjoyed over time(Dolce &amp; Gabbana for example), there comes a time when the formula changes on a dime for no apparent reason and the difference is too noticeable to overlook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This scent is fresh and clean smelling; and purchasing it through Amazon is EXACTLY the same as buying in the department store - only less expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly confident I did not receive a fake or diluted bottle, which has clearly been a problem on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The entire package was sealed, un-tampered with and the box had a complete UPC with correct origin verbiage, and the spray bottle itself was properly serial</li>
            <li>Sort of like that final scene in 40 Year Old Virgin when Michael Scott finally put it in.</li>
            <li>most likely won&#x27;t get confused with Aqua Di Gio).  </li>
            <li>this perfume had used on other occasions and well, but I just bought this when I wear it, the scent does not last more than 30 minutes, so I am not satisfied with the purchase, I feel that I paid for a perfume falsified.</li>
            <li>I sprayed a good 3 sprays on my coat the other day and after I put it on, I hardly recognized that I had previously sprayed it on.</li>
            <li>It stays all day long and even blends with the natural body scent.</li>
            <li>This leads me to believe the real thing was in the tube and the containter was watered down.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately the scent is very light.</li>
            <li>It now consistently seems to be diluted and with about an hours longevity and very little projection.</li>

            <li> The smell of this cologne is absolutely amazing &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing and everybody compliments my boyfriend on it</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but it fades fast, not the best buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for a summer cologne</li>
            <li> Liked it and knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li> The logo at the bottom of the box was cut with a razor and covered by some kind of masking tape.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nicely wrapped and the serial numbers on the box and bottle match.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> his Christmas very happy, thanks</li>
            <li> We buy colognes to smell nice, and getting compliments always help justifies the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, just not too impressed with the scent.</li>
            <li> I own about 60 and growing.  </li>
            <li> This came as a gift set with bath gel, that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I really liked this fragance.</li>
            <li> I loved the cologne and on top of that came with body wash.</li>
            <li> in all, my order (fulfilled by Loving Life Perfumes) appears to be legitimate.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is nice looking too.</li>
            <li> Good price on my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I own Jimmy Choo Man and Versace Pour Homme as well</li>
            <li> He liked it</li>
            <li> Love it good pricing .buy</li>
            <li> My lady finds it edible, so let&#x27;s be honest fellas</li>
            <li> And by the way this item is non refundable or returnable because it is flammable or hazardous.</li>
            <li> THE BOYFRIEND REALLY LIKED IT.</li>
            <li> Very Clean!  </li>
            <li> It is great in the summer time and is very fresh as the name, &amp;#34;Eau Fraiche&amp;#34; would suggest.</li>
            <li> Light clean scent perfect for summertime</li>
            <li> THIS COLOGNE HAS A GREAT, CLEAN SMELL.</li>
            <li> ;) A very good price compared to department stores</li>
            <li> Love this perfume smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aquatic and strong and all around a good scent.</li>
            <li> very mild good for summer time/day time use</li>
            <li> Great deal- shipped quickly</li>
            <li> It is a nice, fresh, happy smell; but try it on to see how it suits your skin.</li>
            <li> and then I switched to Versace, which I think is a fair bit more sexy.  </li>
            <li> i have a very strong sense of smell..  </li>
            <li> and I love it even more!  </li>
            <li> the smell is amazing and you will get many compliments.</li>
            <li> It is the most amazing scent ever.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Versace fragrance out there!!</li>
            <li> Really nice scent, without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best scent on the market.</li>
            <li> However, if you buy directly from Amazon, you can expect superb results.</li>
            <li> I think it adds a very nice touch and makes a man smell like he is clean and elegant instead of a ragtag</li>
            <li> Original and good</li>
            <li> Not only is this cologne one of the best scents I have ever purchased, but the shipping time was amazing and the email updates were prompt.</li>
            <li> This cologne definitely deserves 5 stars for its great smell, and great value.</li>
            <li> Very nice using it right</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but even one spray seems to be VERY strong.  </li>
            <li> This item had a really good price for the size, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this item was or is the original thing.</li>
            <li> Great deal and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great Value, Shipped on Time and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, I really like, and my wife too, the smell is fresh, citric, as a summer fragrance while remaining elegant, excellent choice!!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, good price.</li>
            <li> This was not the first time I buy this cologne and definitely won&#x27;t be the last.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for their great service and awesome</li>
            <li> Very light, more of a summer day scent.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband - fresh, clean scent - he likes &amp; so do I ! ! !</li>
            <li> The bottle size is large and we are happy with the buy.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I saw many reviews that most of these are counterfeit, but still ended up getting on.</li>
            <li> I experienced it for real this time.</li>
            <li> the item as described, even better for me.  </li>
            <li> I tend to lean toward &amp;#34;light fruity citrus&amp;#34; type colognes, but as soon as I tested this one i fell in love.</li>
            <li> This smell is more musty and the smell dies out within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get better than this...  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend(s) love it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with my order.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent to wear.</li>
            <li> The ladies LOVE it &amp; the guys want to know what it is &amp; where to buy it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve worn many colognes over the years</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never received as many compliments from women</li>

            <li> so I can make sure the smell is OK.  </li>

            <li> It smells really good and the price was so much cheaper than buying from a department store.</li>
            <li> Eau Fraiche is another nice fresh scent...</li>
            <li> very fresh, sophisticated smell.</li>
            <li> It quickly catapulted itself to my favorite cologne of his (and he has many).</li>
            <li> This is just a classic cologne by Versace, its light, its refreshing, good in the summer or winter.</li>
            <li> Always appreciated and the wonderful smell never gets old!</li>
            <li> But this one seems to fade away very quickly.</li>
            <li> There has been some criticism that Man Eau Fraiche cologne fades easily -</li>
            <li> , I get compliments all the time on how nice I smell and the ladies love it haha.</li>
            <li> It is not as strong as I thought.</li>
            <li> females stop you and be real loud and say um you smell good.</li>
            <li> It is light and fades in scent easily, however.</li>
            <li> Cool &amp; refreshing &amp; light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light &amp; easy to wear anytime...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne, and with my bottle quickly drying up, I decided to see what Amazon could offer.  </li>

            <li> It smells light</li>
            <li> Fresh, aquatic fragrance with Lemon and lime top notes</li>
            <li> I am very picky and own 50+ fragrances.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely authentic and worth a purchase.</li>
            <li> Great scent that lasts and will definitely get you compliments!  </li>
            <li> but i got it in the mail today and its the real thing, and not to mention it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend to enjoy it on me.</li>
            <li> Amazon delivered great service at an amazingly low price.  </li>
            <li> Even though it wasn&#x27;t prime eligible, it did offer free shipping, so I took the plunge without reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s my primary go-to.</li>
            <li> Seems genuine.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells fantastic-</li>
            <li> I enjoy it every time i use it.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment.</li>
            <li> I sound like a man.</li>
            <li> Bottle &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; cheap and plastic</li>
            <li> i bought it years ago and loved it 6-7 years later i still love this scent.</li>
            <li> It is a great bottle, even though it&#x27;s made out of plastic, and sprays very well, but if you tend to have drier skin where fragrances just don&#x27;t have the sillage required to wear all day in the office or a day out, I really can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> the fragrances are not quite the same as the ones I sample in Sephora, I do think this one is the authentic since it has a serial number and all, but the smell is not as good</li>
            <li> The bottle itself looks effectively identical to the bottle I own, with the exception of a serial number sticker being in a slightly different place.  </li>
            <li> Only con is it is not CH Chic or Armani Code; honestly you should look at buying one of those two before you look here.(They are well liked).</li>
            <li> Everything good so far</li>
            <li> and the price was great- better than the other sites I went to.</li>
            <li> Smells great, the packaging was all original and it came the very next day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real Parfum! !!</li>
            <li> haha, I PROMISE!!!</li>
            <li> It was the REAL THING!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very fresh manly fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent gives a very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I will order a second bottle soon because it will be a great gift to someone special</li>
            <li> They are usually among the best smelling, and maintain their scent (they don&#x27;t morph into smelling like a cheap musky product).  </li>
            <li> Nice, fresh, crisp smell.  </li>
            <li> This is my boyfriends new favorite cologne and mine too, and I can&#x27;t stop smelling him!</li>
            <li> amazing high end designer fragrance.</li>
            <li> and i enjoyed it very much at the time.</li>
            <li> Amazing product super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Its a great smell, lasts long too.</li>
            <li> The smell was 100% better and that one spray lasted me the whole day through night!</li>
            <li> Its definitively unique</li>
            <li> The cologne came in the original box sealed with plastic shrink wrap.</li>
            <li> if you want an original cologne or perfume go to a department store or an authorized seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an original brand by Versace they won&#x27;t produce something like that.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Perfume was not an Original one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and smells great, what else could you want.  </li>
            <li> The Versace Man Eau Fraiche is probably the best cologne I&#x27;v used so far and this is definitely gonna be a keeper.</li>
            <li> Best kept secret, I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments as this cologne.</li>
            <li> Best smelling cologne for a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like an old man, and doesn&#x27;t want to over power the entire room with their scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this of course reminds me a lot of clean water with a hint of floral.</li>
            <li> thats super cheap,</li>
            <li> I received it the next day and the full cologne came with the shower gel as a set which was an amazing surprise!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it to clean my windows just to see...</li>
            <li> There are not a lot of mens colognes that I like but this one smells clean, not fruity or over baring.  </li>
            <li> It is not overly woody, but a clean scent.  </li>
            <li> It is actually quite pleasant to look at</li>
            <li> It has a very clean and crisp smell that is almost aquatic.</li>
            <li> Super fast shippment and its 100 % authentic as I checked it on available sites used for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to throw a quick review of this handsome set that I received, which included the 3.4oz spray and a 3.4oz shower gel / body wash in a nice travel set box, for only paying for a 3.4oz bottle.</li>

            <li> love it just pure awesomeness</li>
            <li> When looking for something special for my son for Christmas, my husband suggested this cologne.</li>
            <li> for refunding me my money right away!</li>
            <li> my best advice is to always try it first on your skin and wait a few hours to see what it does.</li>
            <li> Highway robbery, this is not the real thing, more alcohol than anything else.</li>
            <li> Such a good deal.  </li>
            <li> The scent is modern and sophisticated without being overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Gotta keep myself smelling sweet.</li>
            <li> but overall it was quite good.</li>
            <li> I have liked others but by far this is my favorite out others, there have been some real bombs.</li>
            <li> Italians are good for clothes and French are the people to make colognes.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I just double checked the shirt, and it smells good as I would expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 100% authentic and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My husband always wears Cool Water.  </li>
            <li> Constantly get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Non offensive and most people will find it very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> I decided that I would just go to a department store and pay the full price.</li>
            <li> It last all day, good projection without killing people.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price out of any other store for this particular scent.</li>
            <li> This is a smooth slightly synthetic blend of apples, citrus and tea notes with great longevity and projection.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is strong enough that I can use one spray, although I think it helps that I&#x27;m in a warm climate.  </li>
            <li> The first use was strong and I received comments at work.  </li>
            <li> I am a little upset because I love a good strong crisp cologne.</li>
            <li> Its unique and like a powder, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This cologne was far above my expectations very very good</li>
            <li> Always smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> And smell so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne for my husband and I not only love the scent but love the price.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and was factory sealed when i opened it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you purchased this from a department store it would smell completely different (better).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back when he needs more.</li>
            <li> the problem is it dissipates quickly</li>
            <li> At two reputable locations I noticed the same differences with my all time favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I feel as if the smell goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> it came right on time and it came in the original box.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you like refreshing colognes</li>
            <li> I would just like to say that he loves it so very much!</li>
            <li> I first bought this cologne in the duty free shop when we were on our way home from Paris for a birthday gift.  </li>
            <li> I loved it then and can&#x27;t remember why I waited so long to buy it again.  </li>
            <li> , that instead not only was that 3.4oz bottle included, but it was tucked away nicely inside of complete Versace travel set, with bonus 3.4oz shower gel in a nicely appointed box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells great but starts dying down like an hour afterwards.</li>
            <li> For some that&#x27;s great because they prefer a faded, more subtle smell.</li>
            <li> Brand new and sealed 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my nephew who wanted it more than a new car.  </li>
            <li> I been using different types of cologne for a long time, but this cologne is simply amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> The scent seems ok on first test, but I am very suspicious.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful scent which is not overpowering and seems to last all day long.  </li>
            <li> and I just want to confirm that it is real ,not a fake ,as many are writing here.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragance is similar to that of dolce gab light blue just not as strong which is better, I think this perfume should be unisex though because i use it all the time :)</li>
            <li> smells great and lasts a long time, highly reccomend</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would totally recommend this amazing perfum.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and is a real lady killer</li>
            <li> Great price, everything as expected, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Really good scent as expected.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cooling, fresh, watery and chill.</li>
            <li> my friend liked it when I gave it to him as a present.</li>
            <li> id only used hollister and AE and coolwater and diesel before this, but honestly, versace puts them to shame.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace the D&amp;G Light Blue I used up, but chose this instead, and I am enjoying it.</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and last all day.</li>
            <li> This is fresh and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> The aroma is fresh, it&#x27;s sensual, exciting.  </li>
            <li> 17 yr old said all the girls love it on him.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> i dont know what else to say other that it smells good</li>
            <li> In the right smel.</li>
            <li> Came right on time</li>
            <li> Opened the box and the cologne did not smell right.  </li>
            <li> right time as described</li>
            <li> also the price was great, much cheaper than in any other store!</li>
            <li> The bottle is a cool design and it&#x27;s a decent size for the price!</li>
            <li> It has a soft clean smell!</li>
            <li> Was a gift for a friend, yes would recommend this for men who like a crisp fresh wood smell.</li>
            <li> Not too strong but not too soft.</li>
            <li> Came super duper fast, was freaking out cause I bought it a Week before valentines day</li>
            <li> Great big box for a big bottle.</li>
            <li> Its a very soft scent with a smooth texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically a Nautica, Cool Water, Chrome, Boucheron, Tommy, CK kind of guy.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong but its enough to catch attention and it gives a whif of summer freshness its like a sweet citrusy smell.</li>
            <li> I like the scent very much.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect scent for a hot summer day, it&#x27;s casual and fresh, and pretty versatile for the type of scent</li>
            <li> One little spritz is all I need every morning, and I am good for the day.</li>
            <li> Bought this from amazon.com first time i ever bought a fragrance off amazon.</li>
            <li> The bottle was exactly like the one in the store and it smells just like it</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I want the first one</li>
            <li> As with all fragrances, it pays to try it on first.</li>
            <li> The first one that I received was tampered with.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought cologne from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying it for my boyfriend because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is the reason my current gf is with me...</li>
            <li> first impression of the product was that it reminded me of the ocean.</li>
            <li> However, I found that it does wonders in intimate situations where you don&#x27;t really want to give someone a nose full of musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product smells as if it wasn&#x27;t 100% authentic, I bought same product from Macys before, and the one from Macys smells stronger.</li>
            <li> but i want one that smells really great last long all day no matter</li>
            <li> I found this to be remarkably similar to Versace Por Homme, but maybe a bit lighter and more summer oriented.  </li>
            <li> Really like this!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Italian perfumes and this one is of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and packaged well!</li>
            <li> The first day I ha it</li>
            <li> Whether you struggle to see this on your first wearing, give it time.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to order name brand cologne from amazon.  </li>
            <li> But after finishing his first bottle of Man, he requested another for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I love this smell, It also last for some time a couple of days to exact.</li>
            <li> And I was so satisfied with the big size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> The value appeared to be off the charts, with a 3.4 oz (100 mL) bottle costing only $6 more than the 1.7 oz (50 mL) bottle.  </li>
            <li> He had compliments from 2 females the first night he wore it.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before, this is my first time buying online</li>
            <li> Never fails to get compliments when im out.</li>
            <li> Any man who wants to turn on a woman must get this!</li>
            <li> so I will see how it smells during hot summer days.</li>
            <li> and when it&#x27;s 60 degrees without much variation in the results.&lt;br /&gt;But, on some people, this fragrance sticks to their skin for DAYS!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The cologne was exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li> is my first time buying Versace cologne for myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure something got mixed up somewhere, but for once I got a bonus in my shipment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure something got mixed up somewhere, but for once I got a bonus in my shipment!</li>
            <li> And the price was reasonable too!</li>
            <li> save your money and buy it from Macy&#x27;s because it will only cost you 10-20 dollars more</li>
            <li> My first time purchase of this cologne.</li>
            <li> If you are used to this fragrance, the formula appears to have changed to a weaker and more diluted version of its former self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is your first time buying this fragrance</li>
            <li> This was exactly what my husband wanted</li>
            <li> I will gladly pay the extra money to buy this at a department store from now on</li>
            <li> The scent stays and lasts a very long time which is a great quality when you like the scent obviously.</li>
            <li> He is very sensitive to perfumes/colognes, most of them make him sneeze and give him a headache,  so far this one hasn&#x27;t bothered him at all.</li>
            <li> My husband works around other people so it is important that his cologne not be too strong.</li>
            <li> Somewhere between a sport and powder, this scent is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> What else can I say ladies love, it young and old.</li>
            <li> The packaging also goes hand in hand with the scent of the unit which is very blissful but more about that later.</li>
            <li> I Just love this cologne spray it last for the whole 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Lol I read the other reviews and I can say exactly the same thing about girls and this cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong, only one spray will get me through the day.</li>
            <li> Not strong just a nice fresh smell</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells and have heard nothing but positive feedback.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal - not a fake.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;re safe buying fragranaces from Amazon as long as they&#x27;re $25 dollars and under...</li>
            <li> It is real, not fake.</li>
            <li> however it does smell pretty close to the real thing</li>
            <li> It was packaged perfectly to prevent damage, brand new still wrapped, and took less time to send than expected.</li>
            <li> Spice\\&quot; Its light and fresh but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Only need 1 or 2 sprays and lasts hours without having an overly strong scent.</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The very first moment after the scent of this cologne went up my nose, and processed by my brain, I felt complete.</li>
            <li> it&#x60;s smell nice and fresh and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I think this scent is similar, but refreshing and new.  </li>
            <li> The moment I tried this cologne it smells like pure alcohol with the slightest hint of the real thing.</li>
            <li> Thank you Versace for making a big, chubby, and sweaty man a little more appealing.</li>
            <li> I really wish Amazon would stop using UPS.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> If one wants to smell like my YRNs &amp;#34;The Migos&amp;#34;, One must buy this scent.</li>
            <li> The deal couldn&#x27;t be real.</li>
            <li> lady appreciated the cologne and couldn&#x27;t wait for me put it on.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> Fast and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper than the price at retail stores.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I have to conclude that this may not be the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cologne.  </li>
            <li> This was my second purchase so that he could continue to enjoy this cologne.  </li>
            <li> I really like this item,</li>
            <li> the code on the bottom isnt a real versace code.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> im gonna buy another one for myself my dad really like it</li>
            <li> and the scent lasts for the whole day</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> as a college student, I would prefer that it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted a summer</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing</li>
            <li> some times they&#x27;re the real deal</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get cloying at all, overall a well rounded smooth juice.</li>
            <li> and it is the real stuff not a knock off</li>
            <li> This is the real thing ladies and gents.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves the scent</li>
            <li> This cologne IS the real thing, I compared it to a sample I got from Sephora</li>
            <li> He absolutely LOVES IT....</li>
            <li> Came fast and was packed well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft, fresh scent</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really close to the skin.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Amazon sells genuine products and this was not shipped by a 3rd party as others seem to have been reporting that&#x27;s how they were ripped</li>
            <li> This was the real deal.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing the cologne itself that I purchased from Sephora (the real deal).</li>
            <li> that wears too much cologne.</li>
            <li> so much guys</li>
            <li> i really appreciate it</li>
            <li> I am very manly.</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> i think it smells like microwaved cat piss, but apparently at least one gorgeous woman does not share that sentiment.</li>
            <li> It has an atmospheric quality to it, this loves warm weather especially if you&#x27;re by water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells good, slow shipping even with prime</li>
            <li> I can tell you it&#x27;s just a light, fun, a little sweet but still masculine scent that I expect to have hoards of women flocking to.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cologne that has a distinct, but subtle smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and so do other people.  </li>
            <li> It is unique enough that people will ask you what you&#x27;re wearing (ie.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to try to describe it because I&#x27;m not really good at it, but it smells so good and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s got a fresh, clean, low key scent if I can just figure out how to not make it permeate through the air so much.</li>
            <li> Overall, the packaging is different from the regular overly masculine perfume containers that we see today that makes themselves look too bold for their own good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, however I don&#x27;t know what it is but half the time I buy from Amazon</li>
            <li> I guess its an older cologne</li>
            <li> This particular one from amazon...</li>
            <li> Very fresh, and scent lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t reccomend it too highly though lest you all steal my scent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is high-end cologne-  highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so I know am getting a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on other colognes, but this by far has received the most.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% not original and just wonder how many customers rated this 5 starts .</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> Now this is by far my front runner of cologne here!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its aged or what but the actual smell isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> After a few more uses, I noticed that I couldn&#x27;t even smell it.  </li>
            <li> Not a loud sweet scent.</li>
            <li> The French definition of \\&quot;Eau Fraiche\\&quot; is \\&quot;fresh water\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> Same goes for any woman that wants to be turned on by her man;)</li>
            <li> for 4 stars ,well I didn&#x27;t like the opening and after a while when it is dried out it smells much better, maybe because it is summer fragrance</li>
            <li> I have received very positive remarks from some female colleagues at work while wearing this.  </li>
            <li> The bottle came on time, is NOT old smelling or quick fading, and people like it.(if</li>
            <li> but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorites</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A NEW COLOGNE.</li>
            <li> New merchandise, not a tester.</li>
            <li> After going out in Chicago&#x27;s Boystown, I knew I needed new cologne ASAP.</li>
            <li> Similar to DG light blue for women...</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected and exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li> Very classy scent that stays with you throughout the day but is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Very soft smell but still very masculine.</li>
            <li> The pckaging and bottle looked exactly the same as if I had bought the item at a department store.    </li>
            <li> Well i first smelled this product in my local mall</li>
            <li> First off, let me start off by saying that I am female</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exactly the same.</li>
            <li> about it has a very unique take on the other blue fragrances out there, just for me it lacked that uniqueness and punch that I was looking for.    </li>
            <li> Went searching for a new cologne after they stopped making my old one.  </li>
            <li> I have used Versace for the last five years, its a good cologne; the package did not have any padding for protection just a piece of brown paper, not good, product was nor damage</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice to, but that is pretty irrelevant.</li>
            <li> scent is soft and smooth and last for a long time, always get complements when I wear it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not look original, the smell does not last long...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually jump on the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; bandwagon, but the first thing that caught my attention was a cheapish loose fitting cap - which led me to look for a matching serial number.  </li>
            <li> My wife agreed with me that it was clearly tampered with.  </li>
            <li> If you ever bought the real thing you&#x27;ll instantly know the difference.</li>
            <li> Old ladies, waitress&#x27;, people in the store have stopped and ask me what I wear.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> When deciding who to purchase from, I implore you to stick with Amazon.com directly, regardless of price.      </li>
            <li> This stuff drives the gals wild whether I&#x27;m hittin&#x27;</li>
            <li> Not so masculine, but will get you notice.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x60;t bought this fragrance online so far ?</li>
            <li> I have to use twice as much of this to smell it and it does not last all day.</li>
            <li> Well I read some of these and can tell you this in NO way smells like \\&quot;Old</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and was package properly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it, not lasting longer.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh at all and even if you spray it liberally, your colleagues will not complain at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> surprised when I got the package in the mail</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift to my Godson and so far I have not heard any complaints.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived early, I think by a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the product was as described and not an imitations as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> bought this as a gift from amazon.com directly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, yet masculine..........</li>
            <li> I only paid for a 3.4oz bottle of this cologne, and what I got was much</li>
            <li> Well worth the $40 I spent for ot.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but is fake</li>
            <li> You can say I am a ladies man on my college campus, and I always had girls loving the way I smell, but this cologne makes them want me soo bad its funny!!</li>
            <li> the popularity of summer aromatic aquatics has become a little bit redundant from one house to the next,and while this fragrance opens up with a beautiful blend of citrus notes and maybe a touch of lavender, it has absolutely no projection and within two hours disappears.</li>
            <li> Received this item very quickly and when I got it, it was much larger than I expected, this will last my brother in law all year.</li>
            <li> Bought several other colognes but dont have the original to compare, please do not buy.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m not sure if this adulterated product is safe on my skin, there is a definite health concern here as I do not know what this fragrance was \\&quot;cut\\&quot; with!)    </li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m not sure if this adulterated product is safe on my skin, there is a definite health concern here as I do not know what this fragrance was \\&quot;cut\\&quot; with!)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered &amp; expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The first one, which I ordered, is a light blue bottle whereas the latter one is a dark blue and smells drastically different.</li>
            <li> love this scent for my other half</li>
            <li> Before it was exceptional in both and less \\&quot;woody\\&quot; on the dry down.</li>
            <li> and it was SEXY looking, and the bottle was actually frosty cold, might have to do with the fact its snowy outside XD and when i sprayed it i instantly fell inlove:) smells SO gooooooddddd</li>
            <li> last time when I order this particular item, you sent me a wrong kind of versace which I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> When I saw this was barely $40, I knew I couldn&#x27;t pass it up!  </li>
            <li> not sure if its the Original....</li>
            <li> /&gt;After noticing the projection and longevity to be significantly diminished in my last few bottles ordered on-line, I gave up.</li>
            <li> What the heck I just got my cologne and it smells like pure alcohol with a super weak scent</li>
            <li> a large cologne spray to last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is subtle to the nose, so the wearer won&#x27;t easily recognize its potency.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on at the store early one morning and the scent stayed on me until the next day...</li>
            <li> I was surprised and concerned to see a number of reviews that suggested that the product was an obvious counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> after several use, it&#x27;d become your natural scent even when you use it.</li>
            <li> First of all those who say it does not last long obviously purchased a counterfeit bottle online.</li>
            <li> (Only because it shipped near me) I couldn&#x27;t be any happier.</li>
            <li> It smells watered down or perhaps it got hot and</li>
            <li> I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li> As with a few other fragrances I have enjoyed over time(Dolce &amp; Gabbana for example), there comes a time when the formula changes on a dime for no apparent reason and the difference is too noticeable to overlook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This scent is fresh and clean smelling; and purchasing it through Amazon is EXACTLY the same as buying in the department store - only less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly confident I did not receive a fake or diluted bottle, which has clearly been a problem on Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The entire package was sealed, un-tampered with and the box had a complete UPC with correct origin verbiage, and the spray bottle itself was properly serial</li>
            <li> Sort of like that final scene in 40 Year Old Virgin when Michael Scott finally put it in.</li>
            <li> most likely won&#x27;t get confused with Aqua Di Gio).  </li>
            <li> this perfume had used on other occasions and well, but I just bought this when I wear it, the scent does not last more than 30 minutes, so I am not satisfied with the purchase, I feel that I paid for a perfume falsified.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a good 3 sprays on my coat the other day and after I put it on, I hardly recognized that I had previously sprayed it on.</li>
            <li> It stays all day long and even blends with the natural body scent.</li>
            <li> This leads me to believe the real thing was in the tube and the containter was watered down.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the scent is very light.</li>
            <li> It now consistently seems to be diluted and with about an hours longevity and very little projection.</li>
            <li> ,i ordered online from Amazon and since I got it and did the same what I did at the department store ,just few minutes after that I hardly can smell it ,and when first spray you smell alcohol only same as cheap cologne .This explain it half price as it is at Macy&#x27;s or Sephora  .</li>
            <li> Sometimes it hard to find the right match in colognes.</li>
            <li> This particular bottle only lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Before I discovered this scent in the pages of a very manly magazine, I&#x27;ve always had a strange feeling as if I was missing something.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells the same, but just doesnt seem to last as long as the product I buy in the mall.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exactly the same but less than half the price of the one at Sephora.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The cologne box was neatly wrapped in professional looking plastic wrap, and there were no obvious signs of the box being previously opened.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear \\&quot;Touch\\&quot; by Burberry, but \\&quot;Touch\\&quot; wears off fast.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is real.</li>
            <li> but in the bottle I ordered online the cologne was noticeably thinner and the smell didn&#x27;t last as long as the store-bought version but with the amount of savings you get from the online version</li>
            <li> Long story short,    </li>
            <li> However, as some have already commented, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for too long - max 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> As a purchaser of this cologne, I do know of some of the long lasting issue of this cologne too.</li>
            <li> and I remember it having a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the ones I have tried at fragrance places like Sephora...</li>
            <li> Scent is long lasting!</li>
            <li> Cerruti Image was my regular one for a long time</li>
            <li> I paid far less on Amazon</li>
            <li> Because I have another smaller bottle of this, so I recognized at the first beginning this one does not last that long, usually weak off after 2h</li>
            <li> I never learn from from my mistakes from buying perfume online ,I thought Amazon same as Macy&#x27;s ,but its way different ,I was at Macy&#x27;s the other day and tried this on my hand ,I went home and all night the smell on my hand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little soft, almost feminine.</li>
            <li> this has to be watered down with alcohol no other way of explaining it ..</li>
            <li> Was afraid to purchase because of the many fakes out there.</li>
            <li> The cologne took too long to arrive.</li>
            <li> Actually a larger size than I expected.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It was shipped earlier than expected through amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overpowering smell, but it is &amp;#34;commanding&amp;#34; and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> For the price I like it, but the scent doesn&#x27;t stick around as long as I&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li> how long it lasted.  </li>
            <li> I believe that the bottle was watered down the smell only lasting for about 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li> I mean really, who buys a fragrance without smelling?</li>
            <li> However, I will have to agree with the other reviews, the smell does not last that long.  </li>
            <li> Women simply adore it, only a little bit is needed.</li>
            <li> you wearing this or other colognes to get noticed look no further).</li>
            <li> So I was a little skeptical about this being &#x27;authentic&#x27; by reading some of the reviews here, but when I saw it was ordered and shipped by Amazon</li>
            <li> I actually envy how well it projects, and lasts compared to the other colognes I won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price on here too, peace.</li>
            <li> Very strange.  </li>
            <li> and I would expect versace lasts at least a whole day (24h), since my previous experience told me they should be lasting for a couple of days even after washing I could still smell the flagrance but not this product.</li>
            <li> He is super picky about cologne and usually switches to a new scent when he finishes a bottle because he gets bored.  </li>
            <li> This stuff must be watered down because I had the same bottle that I bought from a well known retailer and it was way stronger than this.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t smell the cologne on me less than 10 minutes later</li>
            <li> Usually I find myself spending no less that $60 a bottle for cologne for my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li> Has a slight lemon scent but really is a mixture of scents that is hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a new cologne,was getting tired of the same ol thing.</li>
            <li> It still lasts til the next morning but with little strength.</li>
            <li> but it was not original but the one I got definitely is.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this and was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t meet a retail purchased cologne.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> Not as expected.</li>
            <li> just as I expected  the fragrance is in a class by itself</li>
            <li> This is both a plus and a minus depending on the situation.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> and so what I expected</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I like the perfume.. but does not last longer than few hours.</li>
            <li> so I checked on Amazon and the price was less than half of what I would have to pay locally!</li>
            <li> It also came with samples of other perfumes and colognes as well as a coupon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Versace Man for the past several years - and I have always been leery of internet sales of this product</li>
            <li> I Won&#x27;t buy him any other cologne.</li>
            <li> , it got to me sooner than I&#x27;d expected, I like this product!</li>
            <li> It was sold by Amazon btw, not some other seller.</li>
            <li> and you have no issues with them, and some other times they are duds</li>
            <li> and I would advise other people not to purchase this also.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because I read reviews stating the product had been tampered with.</li>
            <li> , along with 5 other colognes which I probably could use, but not have the cheddar for.</li>
            <li> I passed my ex-wife in the store the other day, and I know if I was wearing this instead of whatever horrid concoction I sprayed on myself from the glued-on testers in the fragrance section, she would have looked twice.</li>
            <li> my ex-wife in the store the other day,</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews about this product before I brought it..</li>
            <li> Usually would buy at Macy&#x27;s for double the price.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know what it is, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re fakes or if its bad batches that they buy, or if they just don&#x27;t store them correctly and the heat spoils them before they sell them, but so far I had many bad experiences with the fragrances that I have bought directly from them,</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a bad batch or something (evidently this has been the case with other buyers), but don&#x27;t waste your money on this particular cologne.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth it.</li>
            <li> The box was clearly tampered with and the seal was broken.</li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;re looking for a deal (I was too), but it is just not worth the risk.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to throw it in the trash sucks big time</li>
            <li> it is not worth the amount of money saved.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was sour and reeked of alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Wish i had bought this more sooner than i did , but still this cologne is filthy.</li>
            <li> Watered down.</li>
            <li> I think it was &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down.</li>
            <li> and it was water down.</li>
            <li> I looked down at the page and saw the words VERSACE MAN.</li>
            <li> thing I must note is that the smell is not very strong.</li>
            <li> I will say that within an hour to an hour and a half the smell is gone.  </li>
            <li> Why buy from the mall when you can pay half price on Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need my money back cuz its last for one hours its fake</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was much less than at the mall.  </li>
            <li> the price was less then in the store</li>
            <li> (May I suggest Jaguar Black, Kenneth Cole, and Jaguar for men).</li>
            <li> The scent smells odd during colder times of the year</li>
            <li> /&gt;You cant go wrong with this one if your looking for a new cologne to add to your arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was not a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> Sort of weak from the last one I purchase.</li>
            <li> It was old so the strength of the cologne was very very weak.</li>
            <li> Packages seem to always get lost or misplaced.</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon I could have bought cheap designer crap from walmart.</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays and it lasts hours even when in a club or bar scene...</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy or cloying.</li>
            <li> I wish I did because I wasted my time and money on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments on this one.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The only problem is a little lick of the bootle holdet in a wrong position.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;But delivery is a little bit slow...</li>
            <li> Not authentic.</li>
            <li> I let it slide for the past 2 months thinking it was just my nose getting too used to the smell.</li>
            <li> i could still faintly smell it two days after i initially tried it on...</li>
            <li> Definitely not authentic</li>
            <li> Not sure why - but I will not buy this product on-line again.</li>
            <li> usually I pay $50</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> it doesnt hold the scent like in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure on the authenticity of this.</li>
            <li> Well I did, because I was too lazy to fight the mall traffic to sample this fragrance at a department store, and try to be persuaded by a pushy salesperson into buying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three other Versace colognes, but this is the worse.  </li>
            <li> This was also a gift and extremely hard to give a 20 summary.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complaint about.</li>
            <li> will stay on your body at least 5 hours .</li>
            <li> this is definitely NOT AUTHENTIC!</li>
            <li> I always, and truly mean always get complements when I were this.</li>
            <li> I mean come on</li>
            <li> When I received my cologne it was shattered and I was unable to return it due to &amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Chick magnet, I mean every where you go</li>
            <li> I mean, I just couldn&#x27;t smell it!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> and it was very heavy!</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> There is a subtle sweetness to it from the citrus notes.</li>
            <li> Department stores and outlets sell this fragrance in the $60-70 range but Amazon is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> There is no good smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no good with those things.</li>
            <li> After 2 hours, the smell becomes extremely weak.</li>
            <li> This actually never met my expectation and honestly,I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to over apply this cologne.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why but the quality of this product is very poor.  </li>
            <li> I do not want to give a false impression that I do not like it,</li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> , the citrus burst dries down to an aromatic woody fragrance with amber and musk base</li>
            <li> No way to prove this but at a mimimum it is a very weak scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually very very weak smelling.</li>
            <li> Oh was I wrong.</li>
            <li> or i have time to follow up on the occasion you sent the wrong one again.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with Versace...</li>
            <li> this is a fake</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fake, i took it to a department store and they told me it was a fake.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this product made by versace.  </li>
            <li> Just be wary of this before you decide to purchase the product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical reading about the fraud and whatever, plus for $33 a bottle</li>
            <li> stating that the product was fake...</li>
            <li> Would not recommend.... smells fake.</li>
            <li> how can you go wrong.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s a mediocre product.</li>
            <li> I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong, because I trust they</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical thinking at this price</li>
            <li> it was going to be a fake.</li>
            <li> My wife goes crazy when I use it.</li>
            <li> Got them ladies going crazy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time and money !!!!!</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon provides its customers with a horrible service.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> 3 sprays will do the trick but don&#x27;t overdue it or else it will smell bad.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason it is bad and not usable.  </li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve been bad.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I thought this was a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> amazon get your crap in order</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The worst purchase I ever made from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Horrible customer service.</li>
            <li> my worst purchase ever done on amazon.</li>
            <li> If u don&#x27;t want to see disappointment in the eyes of your men, don&#x27;t buy it here!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> CAME IN JUST IN TIME...NO FAKE %100 REAL AND SMELLS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> ITs okay but its kinda not lasts longer than one that I had before.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, slow shipping even with prime it took 5 days&lt;br /&gt;but cheap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations and more!</li>
            <li> Love. Item.cost. was. Great. Item. Delivered. On. Time. And. In. Good. Condition</li>
            <li> Highway robbery, this is not the real thing, more alcohol than anything else. DO NOT BUY. BUYER BEWARE. If you ever bought the real thing you&#x27;ll instantly know the difference. Bought several other colognes but dont have the original to compare, please do not buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent and smells so good.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son-in-law.  It was the fragrance he wanted and he was very pleased. The bottle looked very nice as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this from amazon.com first time i ever bought a fragrance off amazon. The scent is nice, but it fades fast, not the best buy.</li>
            <li> Not authentic. Watered down.</li>
            <li> The bottle was exactly like the one in the store and it smells just like it but in the bottle I ordered online the cologne was noticeably thinner and the smell didn&#x27;t last as long as the store-bought version but with the amount of savings you get from the online version I think you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I would actually give this 0 start. The worst purchase I ever made from Amazon. I saw many reviews that most of these are counterfeit, but still ended up getting on. I experienced it for real this time. The fragrance does not even last for 30 minutes. I paid $40 for nothing but water spray. Totally not worth it. Please don&#x27;t buy this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have received very positive remarks from some female colleagues at work while wearing this.  Very classy scent that stays with you throughout the day but is not overpowering.  Has a slight lemon scent but really is a mixture of scents that is hard to describe.  Would work well going to work or taking your wife/girlfriend out on a date.</li>
            <li> love it just pure awesomeness</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but I can live with it. It&#x27;s nice for a summer cologne</li>
            <li> Nothing to complaint about. the item as described, even better for me.  great fragance, .&lt;br /&gt;i would totally recommend this amazing perfum.</li>
            <li> I tend to lean toward &amp;#34;light fruity citrus&amp;#34; type colognes, but as soon as I tested this one i fell in love. It&#x27;s pretty strong, only one spray will get me through the day. it&#x27;s light, yet manly. One of my new favorites</li>
            <li> Just arrived, took it out the box and it was very heavy! Which was GREAT, took it out the box and it was SEXY looking, and the bottle was actually frosty cold, might have to do with the fact its snowy outside XD and when i sprayed it i instantly fell inlove:) smells SO gooooooddddd</li>
            <li> This is a very fresh manly fragrance.The shipping was fast! Its a great smell, lasts long too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for Christmas and I was very pleased with the packaging and the scent.  I paid about $34 for it on Amazon vs the $68 it would have cost at Macy&#x27;s or Dillard&#x27;s. The pckaging and bottle looked exactly the same as if I had bought the item at a department store.    My only issue is with shipping...I really wish Amazon would stop using UPS. But I don&#x27;t know, it may just be my particluar delivery guy. Packages seem to always get lost or misplaced.</li>
            <li> Checked it out in stores. Liked it and knew what I was getting. Arrived as advertised. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product. What you see is what you get. Delivered fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> If one wants to smell like my YRNs &amp;#34;The Migos&amp;#34;, One must buy this scent. It is great in the summer time and is very fresh as the name, &amp;#34;Eau Fraiche&amp;#34; would suggest. It&#x27;s aquatic and strong and all around a good scent. An Aquatic Beast. Versace, Versace! Medusa Head On Me!</li>
            <li> I bought this item from a department store and LOVED the smell. When I was finally done with it (bottle lasted me for about 6 months), I knew it had to be cheaper out there somewhere. I searched amazon, and bam, here it is with the 2 day free shipping with my amazon prime. The deal couldn&#x27;t be real. I purchased it. This smell is more musty and the smell dies out within 30 minutes. I let it slide for the past 2 months thinking it was just my nose getting too used to the smell. Oh was I wrong. I recently visited a department store and gave it a spray. The smell was 100% better and that one spray lasted me the whole day through night! No wonder why this counterfeit bottle is almost used up within 2 months. Buyers, I recommend you save that extra 10-20 bucks and purchase it off a valid online perfume/cologne site or a department store.</li>
            <li> The perfect \\&quot;Suit Cologne\\&quot;, for someone between 30-40, a refined cologne that is perfectly balanced in everyway, and lasts forever... You can&#x27;t get better than this...  and I&#x27;ve tried approx. 100 samples, and this is the only one that says, \\&quot;Did I see you on the cover of GQ?\\&quot; I will never look for another \\&quot;Suit Cologne\\&quot;, for \\&quot;Casual\\&quot; Versace Pour Homme is the best.</li>
            <li> never had smelled prior to ordering....i am beyond happy with the scent</li>
            <li> I tried it on at the store early one morning and the scent stayed on me until the next day... i could still faintly smell it two days after i initially tried it on... i have a very strong sense of smell..  i would describe the scent between a spicy citrus flavor... your gonna have to try it on at a store. Its definitively unique and it smells great</li>
            <li> Ontime delivery and product was intact and in flawless condition! I will certainly purchase from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;My lady appreciated the cologne and couldn&#x27;t wait for me put it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real Parfum! !!***</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. This is the real deal - not a fake. Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> What else can I say ladies love, it young and old. Old ladies, waitress&#x27;, people in the store have stopped and ask me what I wear. It&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Went searching for a new cologne after they stopped making my old one.  My girlfriend(s) love it. I shouldn&#x27;t reccomend it too highly though lest you all steal my scent.</li>
            <li> Fast and just what I wanted.Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> last time when I order this particular item, you sent me a wrong kind of versace which I didn&#x27;t want. Hope you don&#x27;t do again. I was in a rush and I couldn&#x27;t even think to send the item back and request a refund.    Hope this time you do a good job or i have time to follow up on the occasion you sent the wrong one again.    Long story short,    Versace Man Eau Fraiche IS DIFFERENT THAN versace man eau toilette    The first one, which I ordered, is a light blue bottle whereas the latter one is a dark blue and smells drastically different. I want the first one</li>
            <li> As with all fragrances, it pays to try it on first. In the bottle, it smells great. However, my boyfriend tried it and I was not a fan. It did not mix well with his skin.</li>
            <li> Good cologne. Horrible customer service. The cologne took too long to arrive. As usual, Amazon provides its customers with a horrible service.</li>
            <li> The Versace Man Eau Fraiche is probably the best cologne I&#x27;v used so far and this is definitely gonna be a keeper. I&#x27;m always complimented by women and men. But take note that colognes smell different on different people, you probably wanna spray it on your body to test how it smells on you. Its almost an anytime cologne. However, as some have already commented, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for too long - max 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but even one spray seems to be VERY strong.  I don&#x27;t like to overwhelm people with my cologne, so that was a bit of a surprise.  Still, it&#x27;s got a fresh, clean, low key scent if I can just figure out how to not make it permeate through the air so much.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Great price</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne for my husband and I not only love the scent but love the price.  It is so much cheaper than the price at retail stores.  We received it quickly and with free shipping, I saved even more money because I didn&#x27;t even have to leave my house! The cologne came in the original box sealed with plastic shrink wrap.</li>
            <li> I love this item!  It smells great and Amazon did a good job of getting it shipped to me in a timely manner.  I have been very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> As a purchaser of this cologne, I do know of some of the long lasting issue of this cologne too. It smells great but starts dying down like an hour afterwards. It still lasts til the next morning but with little strength.</li>
            <li> Great deal!! Normal-fast shipping. I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with my order. I would definitely buy again and recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was not the first time I buy this cologne and definitely won&#x27;t be the last.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for their great service and awesome price!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is soft and smooth and last for a long time, always get complements when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with Versace... I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not good! Cheap synthetic spoiled smelling &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent to wear. The ladies LOVE it &amp; the guys want to know what it is &amp; where to buy it. But of course, I never tell. Lol.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the fragrance.  What more could a man ask for?  I like it so much that I bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> The first one that I received was tampered with. The logo at the bottom of the box was cut with a razor and covered by some kind of masking tape. Very strange.  I can not figure out why, one may need that logo! The cut was not a factory cut. It was not a clean cut.  Done definitely by an unskilled hand. My wife agreed with me that it was clearly tampered with.  The box was clearly tampered with and the seal was broken. I wrote to Amazon.  Amazon&#x27;s customer service accepted to replace it.  The second one, is in good shape and I am happy.  Love this product and enjoyed it.  I read the reviews and looks like another customer had similar experience. I am happy that I selected Amazon. I like this Eau Fraiche and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> When deciding who to purchase from, I implore you to stick with Amazon.com directly, regardless of price.      The bottle of Versace Eau Fraiche I purchased through AAA Perfumes (AAA Merchants) was tampered with.  The serial number on the bottom of the box did NOT match the one on the bottle which leads me to believe this product is counterfeit.      Furthermore, the serial number on the back of my bottle was tampered with, as if one of the numbers was removed with an Exacto knife.  The fragrance was sour and reeked of alcohol.  Definitely not authentic (and I&#x27;m not sure if this adulterated product is safe on my skin, there is a definite health concern here as I do not know what this fragrance was \\&quot;cut\\&quot; with!)    The box itself appeared tampered with, with lines of adhesive on the box indicating that it had been re-wrapped in cellophane.    Please, stick with Amazon.  All of my fragrance purchases from them directly have been PERFECT, authentic and fresh juice.  I know you&#x27;re looking for a deal (I was too), but it is just not worth the risk.  Now I have the hassle of returning a product which should have been authentic and fresh to begin with.</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells on my man.  He is very sensitive to perfumes/colognes, most of them make him sneeze and give him a headache,  so far this one hasn&#x27;t bothered him at all.</li>
            <li> The bottle of Versace Eau Fraiche I purchased through AAA Perfumes (AAA Merchants) was tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this same product from a department store and it does not have the same Scent! this is definitely NOT AUTHENTIC! DO NOT BUY! (and I&#x27;m not sure if this adulterated product is safe on my skin, there is a definite health concern here as I do not know what this fragrance was \\&quot;cut\\&quot; with!)</li>
            <li> Everything was GREAT with the order, delivery, AND the product.  La-uh-OVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three other Versace colognes, but this is the worse.  It smells GREAT once sprayed, but the fragrance is gone minutes later.  Seriously.  I couldn&#x27;t smell the cologne on me less than 10 minutes later so I sprayed even more.  Minutes later, nothing.  Not sure if this is a bad batch or something (evidently this has been the case with other buyers), but don&#x27;t waste your money on this particular cologne.</li>
            <li> Well i first smelled this product in my local mall and i loved it. The girl that i am currently seeing also loves the smell and she can&#x27;t get enough of it. Its a very soft scent with a smooth texture. Great for your collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn many colognes over the years but I&#x27;ve never received as many compliments from women as I have wearing this Versace cologne. I love it. I&#x27;m definitely sold on this cologne.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I love the smell and so do other people.  It is light and fades in scent easily, however.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my BF as his birthday gift , he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;But delivery is a little bit slow...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered &amp; expected.</li>
            <li> I have to conclude that this may not be the real thing.  The first use was strong and I received comments at work.  After a few more uses, I noticed that I couldn&#x27;t even smell it.  This leads me to believe the real thing was in the tube and the containter was watered down.  No way to prove this but at a mimimum it is a very weak scent.</li>
            <li> This item had a really good price for the size, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this item was or is the original thing. I&#x27;ve purchased this cologne before and I remember it having a long lasting smell. But this one seems to fade away very quickly. Ok otherwise for the money.</li>
            <li> This is just a classic cologne by Versace, its light, its refreshing, good in the summer or winter. i bought it years ago and loved it 6-7 years later i still love this scent. Highly recommend if you like refreshing colognes</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and is a real lady killer</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne.  It smells light but it doesn&#x27;t wear off throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for years now. This is the first time I have bought cologne from Amazon. The perfume smells the same, but just doesnt seem to last as long as the product I buy in the mall. I had heard warnings about buying perfume products on Amazon, as it may be diluted, etc., and I am thinking the same. will probably not buy this product again online.</li>
            <li> This cologne was a gift for my BF.  He loved it so much &amp; used it all.  This was my second purchase so that he could continue to enjoy this cologne.  My order was received in a timely fashion &amp; without any complications.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance! My husband gets so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Great deal and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> i dont know what else to say other that it smells good and it gets peoples attention when im at the bar</li>
            <li> Such a good deal.  Usually I find myself spending no less that $60 a bottle for cologne for my boyfriend.  When I saw this was barely $40, I knew I couldn&#x27;t pass it up!  He also loves it and thought it was a great add-on to his Christmas presents.  :-)</li>
            <li> Super fast shippment and its 100 % authentic as I checked it on available sites used for this purpose. The smell is very refreshing and great specially for summers. Its a gift for my husband and he loved it too.</li>
            <li> To me it smells almost like Issey Miyake L&#x27;Eau d&#x27;Issey Pour Homme and I did not like that cologne. So I guess I can say that this cologne is not 4 me.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice. It&#x27;s a little soft, almost feminine. I like it. I just hope it lasts longer than what others have said.</li>
            <li> I got this cologne as a present for my husband on his birthday. I would just like to say that he loves it so very much! Everytime we go out he is smelling like a sexy million bucks. Cool &amp; refreshing &amp; light. Ladies, do not hesitate if you were looking for the perfect cologne for your husband!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite mens colognes. It smells sooo good! This is my second time buying it for my boyfriend because I love it so much! Oh yeah, he likes it too (hehe).</li>
            <li> Great cologne that might feel a tad feminine. Great for the spring and summer.</li>
            <li> Great item, fast shipping, perfect condition</li>
            <li> the smell is amazing and you will get many compliments. 3 sprays will do the trick but don&#x27;t overdue it or else it will smell bad.</li>
            <li> I really like this item, is as was described by the seller, excellent and expedit deliver.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this stuff for 8 years.</li>
            <li> having a collection of over 25 fragrances, I was intrigued by this Versace addition.  the popularity of summer aromatic aquatics has become a little bit redundant from one house to the next,and while this fragrance opens up with a beautiful blend of citrus notes and maybe a touch of lavender, it has absolutely no projection and within two hours disappears. It is a great bottle, even though it&#x27;s made out of plastic, and sprays very well, but if you tend to have drier skin where fragrances just don&#x27;t have the sillage required to wear all day in the office or a day out, I really can&#x27;t recommend this. I do not want to give a false impression that I do not like it, about it has a very unique take on the other blue fragrances out there, just for me it lacked that uniqueness and punch that I was looking for.    As always... my best advice is to always try it first on your skin and wait a few hours to see what it does.</li>
            <li> Bought if for my brother for Christmas. Loved it. Will buy every time.</li>
            <li> I love this colone.  I bought ti for my boyfriend for christmas after he patiently waited for it for 6 months. The bottle is a cool design and it&#x27;s a decent size for the price!</li>
            <li> this is a fake don&#x27;t waste your time and money !!!!! it&#x27;s fake, i took it to a department store and they told me it was a fake. the code on the bottom isnt a real versace code. if you want an original cologne or perfume go to a department store or an authorized seller.</li>
            <li> This stuff drives the gals wild whether I&#x27;m hittin&#x27; the grocery store or shakin&#x27; my money maker at a night club!  The scent is modern and sophisticated without being overbearing.  Definitely not your dad&#x27;s Brut.  lol!</li>
            <li> Not only is this cologne one of the best scents I have ever purchased, but the shipping time was amazing and the email updates were prompt. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells absolutely wonderful. I got it for my fiance, but I&#x27;ll admit that occasionally I&#x27;ll spray some on myself as well. The bottle and box was in good condition. It also came with samples of other perfumes and colognes as well as a coupon. Now who doesn&#x27;t love coupons!</li>
            <li> Great buy! Not a loud sweet scent. Not so masculine, but will get you notice. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear this cologne, I constantly receive compliments about it. This scent is fresh and clean smelling; and purchasing it through Amazon is EXACTLY the same as buying in the department store - only less expensive. There is no difference in quality between the department store and Amazon.</li>
            <li> this review JUST for the fragrance itself , I doesn&#x60;t bought this fragrance online so far ? it&#x60;s smell nice and fresh and long lasting.  will stay on your body at least 5 hours .</li>
            <li> Fresh, aquatic fragrance with Lemon and lime top notes, the citrus burst dries down to an aromatic woody fragrance with amber and musk base&lt;br /&gt;notes. Perfect fragrance for hot Summer days</li>
            <li> I have used Versace for the last five years, its a good cologne; the package did not have any padding for protection just a piece of brown paper, not good, product was nor damage</li>
            <li> Was so happy with perfume,  it came all packaged up and sealed and the fragrance is great,  have gotten many compliments on it</li>
            <li> i think it smells like microwaved cat piss, but apparently at least one gorgeous woman does not share that sentiment.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a deal but I was wrong! This stuff must be watered down because I had the same bottle that I bought from a well known retailer and it was way stronger than this. I have to use twice as much of this to smell it and it does not last all day.</li>
            <li> This is one of the weakest colognes I have ever got in my life i&#x27;m a cologne buff love to smell great I got this and I wanted to throw it in the trash sucks big time you want a good cheap cologne try usher UR or his first 1 he came out with or even Gucci they have some amazing colognes this is a must not buy</li>
            <li> My son loves this cologne. It smells good. The bottle size is large and we are happy with the buy. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Sex in the best I always get compliments at work or outside</li>
            <li> Smells like the one I buy in stores. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Well I read some of these and can tell you this in NO way smells like \\&quot;Old Spice\\&quot; Its light and fresh but lasts a long time. I usually wear \\&quot;Touch\\&quot; by Burberry, but \\&quot;Touch\\&quot; wears off fast. This reminds me of \\&quot;Dreamer\\&quot; by Versace. I always, and truly mean always get complements when I were this. Its unique and like a powder, fresh scent. Shipped quickly and was factory sealed when i opened it. great gift for anyone, unless who you plan on buying this for likes \\&quot;Aspen\\&quot; or \\&quot;Old Spice\\&quot; those guys will definitely not like this.</li>
            <li> I love my baby in that fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne for my son. He absolutely loves it! It shipped fast and was package properly.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is the reason my current gf is with me... I smell great.</li>
            <li> Best kept secret, I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments as this cologne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it, not lasting longer. It&#x27;s not an original brand by Versace they won&#x27;t produce something like that. Anyway !</li>
            <li> I have been using Versace Man for the past several years - and I have always been leery of internet sales of this product (I purchased this product from a wholesale store front distributor a year ago and the odor did not last). I recently purchased this product from Amazon (Amazon meets and/or exceeds my expectations on prior purchases)and the product arrived in the same packaging as I would get from Dillards. The only caveat is - the odor does not last. Not sure why - but I will not buy this product on-line again.</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne! And was an excellent gift for my husband!</li>
            <li> buy it! don&#x27;t doubt about it! girls will love it</li>
            <li> Not the strongest smell. Not as expected.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, good price.</li>
            <li> I had this perfume three years ago and i enjoyed it very much at the time. Since then i never found a fragance that was that good. Very pleased to buy it again</li>
            <li> im gonna buy another one for myself my dad really like it and the scent lasts for the whole day</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine and decided to buy it for my boyfriend. It smells AMAZING!!! We both love it. It quickly catapulted itself to my favorite cologne of his (and he has many). Great price. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> nice size, husband loved it</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven. My wife goes crazy when I use it.</li>
            <li> Looking forward again.</li>
            <li> We. love it!! Always smells fresh and clean. I Won&#x27;t buy him any other cologne.</li>
            <li> It has a soft clean smell!</li>
            <li> I am very picky and own 50+ fragrances.  This one is very nice. It isn&#x27;t strong or overwhelming but just right. It has a warm, fruity, mildly spicy scent that works well for all seasons.  One of my better spring scents and I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and the price was just right. I would put this one up with my $75.00 per oz colognes.</li>
            <li> Best smelling cologne for a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like an old man, and doesn&#x27;t want to over power the entire room with their scent.  One little spritz is all I need every morning, and I am good for the day.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my bf, and he loves it. The smell is so great and wonderful. It&#x27;s light &amp; easy to wear anytime...</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this product made by versace.  its not too strong or too light just perfect, the scent of the versace man is great....</li>
            <li> In time. In box. In the right smel. Great expierience. The only problem is a little lick of the bootle holdet in a wrong position.Thank you</li>
            <li> just as I expected  the fragrance is in a class by itself so is the botttle</li>
            <li> Great great great!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got a bottle in the mail today.  It is totally legit! The packaging was nicely wrapped and the serial numbers on the box and bottle match.  This stuff smells absolutely incredible.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> Really good scent as expected.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume as a gift from my best friend so here are my initial thoughts on the product. First off, let me start off by saying that I am female but I prefer the scent of perfumes that are geared towards men because I am not too fond of overly floral smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of the product was that it reminded me of the ocean. From the blue hue of the packaging and even the perfume container gave me vibes of a blissful ocean. It is actually quite pleasant to look at but it does have some femininity to it. The packaging also goes hand in hand with the scent of the unit which is very blissful but more about that later. Overall, the packaging is different from the regular overly masculine perfume containers that we see today that makes themselves look too bold for their own good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the smell. Now everyone has a way of describing about hoe something smells but I will attempt to be as descriptive as possible. The scent of this of course reminds me a lot of clean water with a hint of floral. It mimics the casing that it comes in being very clean with a hint of femininity. I think it adds a very nice touch and makes a man smell like he is clean and elegant instead of a ragtag cowboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I must note is that the smell is not very strong. This is both a plus and a minus depending on the situation. I sprayed a good 3 sprays on my coat the other day and after I put it on, I hardly recognized that I had previously sprayed it on. Just be wary of this before you decide to purchase the product. However, I found that it does wonders in intimate situations where you don&#x27;t really want to give someone a nose full of musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this perfume but I wish it could be just a tad bit stronger than it is. A great addition to your cologne collection.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a Christmas gift for my brother in law.  he loves the smell, and he made me save some money buying it from amazon:)</li>
            <li> Love this scent and great price! usually I pay $50</li>
            <li> This is a knock off! Doesn&#x27;t smell like the actual cologne at all! Very disappointed in this purchase. It smells like hairspray, not Versace.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic scent and I know when I put it on, I&#x27;m going to smell great. The only problem I have with it is, it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I can get through 7 or 8 hours with it on but as a college student, I would prefer that it lasts the whole day. It&#x27;s definitely authentic and worth a purchase. Amazon has the best price out of any other store for this particular scent.</li>
            <li> It Smells so seductive. I didn&#x27;t regret I bought it. I will order a second bottle soon because it will be a great gift to someone special</li>
            <li> It is a very good smelling cologne and you will get a lot of compliments. However, I will have to agree with the other reviews, the smell does not last that long.  I will say that within an hour to an hour and a half the smell is gone.  I question the authenticity.</li>
            <li> I would recommend all the connaisseurs about that perfume. It is one of the best class.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my son and he loved it. It smells really good and the price was so much cheaper than buying from a department store. I would purchase this again!</li>
            <li> THIS COLOGNE HAS A GREAT, CLEAN SMELL. NOT OVER POWERING.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A NEW COLOGNE.</li>
            <li> Bought at a very Good Price.. Everything I expected. This is really a good quality product.. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The product smells as if it wasn&#x27;t 100% authentic, I bought same product from Macys before, and the one from Macys smells stronger. Whenever I spray on the one from Macys, all day I would get compliments on the smell, now whenever I spray on the one from Amazon, it don&#x27;t even last for 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace.....Versace Medusa head on me like i&#x27;m lumaniti lol... Eau Fraiche is another nice fresh scent... Gotta keep myself smelling sweet. No one like a stinky person lol</li>
            <li> Great delivery and smell</li>
            <li> Good price and shipped with care, it got to me sooner than I&#x27;d expected, I like this product!</li>
            <li> Very nice using it right now!different than the dreamer, Eros,and the original another good one!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome Cologne. It is now my favorite. Smells great and lasts long. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this fragrance I get alot of compliments. Especially from the ladies. It wears well and is not over powering. A great buy in all honesty.</li>
            <li> Smells great!!! I got a big bottle..Good value</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had this for over an year and I really liked it. I finally purchased it and I agree with people calling it a bit synthetic but it still smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent gives a very fresh feeling. Citrus and warm spicy notes in the beginning are amazing! This is everything I want from a summer fragrance: it&#x27;s cooling, fresh, watery and chill. It is the perfect scent for a hot summer day, it&#x27;s casual and fresh, and pretty versatile for the type of scent it is. It is not harsh at all and even if you spray it liberally, your colleagues will not complain at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely buy it again. It makes it to my top 5 summer colognes.</li>
            <li> Great Value, Shipped on Time and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Original and good i advice everyone want this perfume choose this one .</li>
            <li> This is the second or third time I have ordered this cologne for my husband.  It ALWAYS smells wonderful and last all day ... I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Much better than the acqua di gio</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all item I buy their  great</li>
            <li> Wife loves the smell so I&#x27;m good with the  product</li>
            <li> What the heck I just got my cologne and it smells like pure alcohol with a super weak scent SMH I&#x27;m returning this garbage back to amazon this has to be watered down with alcohol no other way of explaining it ..amazon get your crap in order</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  I love how it smells on my husband!  Always looking for the good ones and this is it!</li>
            <li> Lol I read the other reviews and I can say exactly the same thing about girls and this cologne. I get laid last week only because the girl told me that she is getting horny while she is smelling me lol. :D I recommend !</li>
            <li> I bought the 3.3 oz cheaper than I have been buying the 1.7 at Dillard&#x27;s. New merchandise, not a tester.</li>
            <li> it was ok but i want one that smells really great last long all day no matter what when i walk by i want you to smell it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent on me.</li>
            <li> very mild good for summer time/day time use</li>
            <li> I smell so much better now! Good product, great service, and reliable lasting scent. Spray....and walk thru, spray....and walk thru.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne because it&#x27;s almost summer in SoCal and I really wanted a summer cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to try to describe it because I&#x27;m not really good at it, but it smells so good and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Got surprised when I got the package in the mail and it was actually a travel set, which included a shower gel + the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical because I saw many reviews from people that bought colognes from Amazon but it was not original but the one I got definitely is. It was sold by Amazon btw, not some other seller.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift to my Godson and so far I have not heard any complaints.  Hopefully he is wearing it and it is lasting all day.</li>
            <li> Came right on time and so what I expected</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t tell anyone. I don&#x27;t want anyone else wearing it. Only con, you need to use a lot to get it to linger.</li>
            <li> Perfume was not an Original one!&lt;br /&gt;I Used this perfume for 2 years now and it does not smell the same. Got my refund back from amazon already!</li>
            <li> There is no good smell</li>
            <li> Great scent that lasts and will definitely get you compliments!  Not to mention the great price from Amazon!  This is my second bottle that I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
            <li> I love it. my friend liked it when I gave it to him as a present.</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells and have heard nothing but positive feedback. For the price it&#x27;s definitely a great deal.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cologne! One of the best scents by Versace and I will continue to buy this and wear it!</li>
            <li> I found this to be remarkably similar to Versace Por Homme, but maybe a bit lighter and more summer oriented.  Your experience may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is strong enough that I can use one spray, although I think it helps that I&#x27;m in a warm climate.  I&#x27;m fairly confident I did not receive a fake or diluted bottle, which has clearly been a problem on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical reading about the fraud and whatever, plus for $33 a bottle thats super cheap, but i got it in the mail today and its the real thing, and not to mention it smells AMAZING. id only used hollister and AE and coolwater and diesel before this, but honestly, versace puts them to shame. great great product, just make sure youre buying from amazon.com/amazon LLC</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product, and promptness of arrival for this item.</li>
            <li> Really like this! I&#x27;m smelling great for hours on end. Compliments on the way it lingers on me. I got this for my girlfriend to enjoy it on me.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Italian perfumes and this one is of my favorites. The price I found on here is amazing and the smell is marvelous.</li>
            <li> My 18 year-year-old wanted this for Christmas. Well I looked around at the stores and was thinking NO WAY!&lt;br /&gt;Then I was on your site to order toys and found it and at a price I could afford!&lt;br /&gt;Make his Christmas very happy, thanks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing</li>
            <li> Why buy from the mall when you can pay half price on Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is high-end cologne-  highly recommended.  I was looking to replace the D&amp;G Light Blue I used up, but chose this instead, and I am enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I love Versace colognes.  They are usually among the best smelling, and maintain their scent (they don&#x27;t morph into smelling like a cheap musky product).  Another one of my favorite Versace scents is/was Dreamer...but this has now taken Dreamer&#x27;s spot.    I smelled this at the store, and was immediately amazed.  It is unique enough that people will ask you what you&#x27;re wearing (ie. most likely won&#x27;t get confused with Aqua Di Gio).  And chances are you will definitely get compliments on it.    I had this cologne for only a couple hours, and shortly went out to a night club.  I kid you not -- almost every woman that came by me complimented its smell, and asked what it was.  I get compliments on other colognes, but this by far has received the most.  And, that was only one night.    We buy colognes to smell nice, and getting compliments always help justifies the purchase.  This was definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> amazing high end designer fragrance. very fresh, sophisticated smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Arrived on time!</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite scents for men.  Fresh and clean and not overpowering.  Would recommend for anytime use.</li>
            <li> The projection could be better but overall it was quite good.</li>
            <li> The box and wrapping was good, seemed to be from manufacturer. Unfortunately the scent is very light. Shipping was fast, just not too impressed with the scent.</li>
            <li> It is the most amazing scent ever. I have liked others but by far this is my favorite out others, there have been some real bombs.</li>
            <li> Amazing smelling cologne</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have been wearing this for a few years now.  I get compliments daily on it.  Not too strong but not too soft.</li>
            <li> Because I have another smaller bottle of this, so I recognized at the first beginning this one does not last that long, usually weak off after 2h and I would expect versace lasts at least a whole day (24h), since my previous experience told me they should be lasting for a couple of days even after washing I could still smell the flagrance but not this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and would recommend it to others. Great price for the brand and scent! Fast delivery and packaged well!</li>
            <li> The French definition of \\&quot;Eau Fraiche\\&quot; is \\&quot;fresh water\\&quot;... This cologne fits that description well.  Somewhere between a sport and powder, this scent is soft and clean.  While definitely a summer cologne, it can be used for any occasion and during any season.  There has been some criticism that Man Eau Fraiche cologne fades easily - I have found that is not the case.  I suppose it depends on the \\&quot;body chemistry\\&quot;.  Versace scores again with this fragrance and should be added to any collection.  Definitely in my top 5.  Amazon delivered great service at an amazingly low price.  Five stars..!!</li>
            <li> I been using different types of cologne for a long time, but this cologne is simply amazing!!!! The first day I ha it on I had 17 girls run and hug me and telling me I smell good! I even had 3 teachers tell me I smell good too! No joke!! This cologne is amazing! You can say I am a ladies man on my college campus, and I always had girls loving the way I smell, but this cologne makes them want me soo bad its funny!! haha, I PROMISE!!! this cologne is a guarantee!! If you want to smell good at the beach, class, work, party, or club and have girls all over you! THIS VERSACE MAN EAU FRAICHE is the way to go!!</li>
            <li> My fianc√©s favorite!!!! And mine too...;) A very good price compared to department stores and I received it before estimated arrival!! Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> This was bought for my husband who enjoys it.  Very citrusy, which smells great on a man&#x27;s skin.  Refreshing--definitely a summer scent.  Long-lasting too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loved it ! It&#x27;s smells so good and it&#x27;s a great bargain ! It also came like a day after I ordered it .</li>
            <li> This cologne was far above my expectations very very good</li>
            <li> This is simply great!! Smell remains throughout the day!</li>
            <li> Smells good, but is fake</li>
            <li> Product arrived early, I think by a couple of days. Still has the great scent.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, however I don&#x27;t know what it is but half the time I buy from Amazon the fragrances are not quite the same as the ones I sample in Sephora, I do think this one is the authentic since it has a serial number and all, but the smell is not as good and it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the ones I have tried at fragrance places like Sephora... I think you&#x27;re safe buying fragranaces from Amazon as long as they&#x27;re $25 dollars and under...anything more expensive than that is a hit and miss, some times they&#x27;re the real deal and you have no issues with them, and some other times they are duds, I don&#x27;t know what it is, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re fakes or if its bad batches that they buy, or if they just don&#x27;t store them correctly and the heat spoils them before they sell them, but so far I had many bad experiences with the fragrances that I have bought directly from them, its a shame</li>
            <li> Actually a larger size than I expected. My son loved his birthday gift!</li>
            <li> Stuff is great and smells just like it did at Macy&#x27;s. It is a great warm weather scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And these last word are just to meet the minimum post length.</li>
            <li> Smells so good. I love great scents and this is absolutely amazing. I would def. recommend it to any one!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent for men.</li>
            <li> Not sure. I too just received the gel bonus (Travel set) as well. I don&#x27;t usually jump on the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; bandwagon, but the first thing that caught my attention was a cheapish loose fitting cap - which led me to look for a matching serial number.  There was one on the bottle, but it matched nothing on the box. The scent seems ok on first test, but I am very suspicious.  Anyone else?</li>
            <li> This is a youtube legend for a reason.  Whether you struggle to see this on your first wearing, give it time.  This is a smooth slightly synthetic blend of apples, citrus and tea notes with great longevity and projection.  It is subtle to the nose, so the wearer won&#x27;t easily recognize its potency.  But this is one of my most complimented fragrances.  I own about 60 and growing.  It is great for anytime or event, best for warm weather.  Combines lacoste style in play with issey miyake.  I over-spray this quite often to get maximum projection.  Doesn&#x27;t get cloying at all, overall a well rounded smooth juice.</li>
            <li> Got it for a gift my husband loved it</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling colognes ever!</li>
            <li> love this scent for my other half</li>
            <li> I need my money back cuz its last for one hours its fake I spend 87$ for nth I mean come on I throw the bottles in garbage cuz its not for gift too</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to order name brand cologne from amazon.  I was pleasantly surprised that the product was as described and not an imitations as far as I can tell.  It is just like the bottle that my wife purchased at a name brand department store for more than twice the cost.</li>
            <li> This came as a gift set with bath gel, that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever! Got them ladies going crazy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my baby and it smells so good!! The fragance is similar to that of dolce gab light blue just not as strong which is better, I think this perfume should be unisex though because i use it all the time :)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Versace fragrance out there!! Not too floral for a guy and just enough musk to give it a nice manly kick!!</li>
            <li> This was the second bottle of Man that I have bought for my husband. He is super picky about cologne and usually switches to a new scent when he finishes a bottle because he gets bored.  But after finishing his first bottle of Man, he requested another for Christmas. It does smell very good, and he gets compliments on it all the time.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I really liked this fragance. It smells really nice and last all day. It is not as strong as I thought.</li>
            <li> When I received my cologne it was shattered and I was unable to return it due to &amp;#34;hazardous contents&amp;#34; loop hole. I paid for a pile of glass and a cologne soaked box.</li>
            <li> great deal and it is the real stuff not a knock off</li>
            <li> I loved the cologne and on top of that came with body wash. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing ladies and gents. I love this smell, It also last for some time a couple of days to exact.</li>
            <li> buy it for my husband and I am delighted with this perfume smell is wonderful, last long and everyone around you feel it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its aged or what but the actual smell isn&#x27;t very strong. It&#x27;s actually very very weak smelling. I love the scent but it needs to be stronger. I guess its an older cologne so its prob sat on the shelf for awhile. I am a little upset because I love a good strong crisp cologne. Now I find out you cant ship it back. Thank you Amazon I could have bought cheap designer crap from walmart.</li>
            <li> I got off work and rushed home sprayed some on then took  shower got out and still smelled it on me smells great try it and you will love it</li>
            <li> Love it!! Love this scent. I ordered one day and it was shipped on same day. I received it the next day and the full cologne came with the shower gel as a set which was an amazing surprise! Totally exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> good perfume and prices</li>
            <li> Great price, everything as expected, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> thank you u r the best</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, I really like, and my wife too, the smell is fresh, citric, as a summer fragrance while remaining elegant, excellent choice!!</li>
            <li> It is real, not fake.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to be as concentrated as the ones sold at the mall. I think it was &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down. Still smells good though</li>
            <li> excellent was better than I expected arrived quicker than expected great compliments on the smellit&#x27;s my great surprise that also came with a shower gel</li>
            <li> This Spray Is Alsome. It&#x27;s a Chick magnet, I mean every where you go females stop you and be real loud and say um you smell good. I Just love this cologne spray it last for the whole 24 hours. And smell so fresh and clean. And I was so satisfied with the big size bottle it&#x27;s just what I was trying to get. a large cologne spray to last a long time. I will recommend this product to any person who loves to smell good.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it out. it came right on time and it came in the original box. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> This Versace cologne has my boyfriend smelling amazing, gaining many complements from females (and even males!) It was packaged perfectly to prevent damage, brand new still wrapped, and took less time to send than expected. 5 stars for sure, I most definately recommend this seller and product.</li>
            <li> My father had run out of his cologne and I knew it would be a great gift. He absolutely loves the scent and I know I will always have a goto gift when he runs out.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, Item was exactly as described. Great seller. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> One of the best scents out there. I have about 25 different scents, and this is the best discovery to date. Could not be happier with the outcome. Thank you Versace for making a big, chubby, and sweaty man a little more appealing.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this cologne for over three years now and it has become my signature scent, I get compliments all the time on how nice I smell and the ladies love it haha.</li>
            <li> I smell great, thats all anyone can really hope for. The bottle is nice to, but that is pretty irrelevant. The product smells great. I get compliments every time I wear it from guys and girls alike.</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever the hubby  loved it. Packaged great!!!:) very satisfied</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and smells great, what else could you want.  It&#x27;s more of a day time product for me.</li>
            <li> I actually bought it from Macy&#x27;s not Amazone, Smells awesome but fades away so fast !!!! Italians are good for clothes and French are the people to make colognes.</li>
            <li> Amazing purchase. I only ordered the cologne but received the travel set for no extra charge. This cologne IS the real thing, I compared it to a sample I got from Sephora and it&#x27;s exactly the same but less than half the price of the one at Sephora. Extremely pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance. I get complements every time I wear it. Really nice scent, without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes I&#x27;ve smelt..&lt;br /&gt;Guys it gets alot of compliments  and turns alot of heads lol&lt;br /&gt;You cant go wrong with this one if your looking for a new cologne to add to your arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Perfumania!!</li>
            <li> The product smells fantastic, its my husbands favorite scent. The price of the product is a steel too. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  great</li>
            <li> This is 90% Windex window cleaner. It smells just like it! I&#x27;m sure if you purchased this from a department store it would smell completely different (better). This particular one from amazon...no. I&#x27;ve even used it to clean my windows just to see...it worked perfectly. I would not buy this again from Amazon...and I would advise other people not to purchase this also.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my dad for christmas, genuine and smells great. Scent is long lasting! I&#x27;d definately recommend it. Think i saw some reviews here stating that the product was fake...i can safely advise anyone wishing to clarify the products&#x27; authenticity that it is genuine. Happy shopping !</li>
            <li> Amazing product super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I brought this fragrance for my brother.... He absolutely LOVES IT....I give it according to him...‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ. He says the WOMEN LOVE HIS ALORE!!! Go fellas with the AWESOME SMELL....He&#x27;s berry berry HAPPY.</li>
            <li> Received the item in a timely manner. The box was all beat up, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the postal service&#x27;s fault.  Opened the box and the cologne did not smell right.  Took it to Macy&#x27;s and they told me it was counterfeit...  Props to AMAZON! for refunding me my money right away!</li>
            <li> This arrived in perfect condition and quickly, considering I ordered it before Christmas.  The price was very good for this size.  My husband works around other people so it is important that his cologne not be too strong. This is fresh and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  Wonderful scent which is not overpowering and seems to last all day long.  Have had many compliments on this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne, and with my bottle quickly drying up, I decided to see what Amazon could offer.  The value appeared to be off the charts, with a 3.4 oz (100 mL) bottle costing only $6 more than the 1.7 oz (50 mL) bottle.  Even though it wasn&#x27;t prime eligible, it did offer free shipping, so I took the plunge without reading the reviews.  The day before it arrived, I checked the reviews almost as an afterthought - after all, I know what the stuff smells like.  I was surprised and concerned to see a number of reviews that suggested that the product was an obvious counterfeit.  My order was on its way, but I wouldn&#x27;t have made my purchase if I had taken the time to read the reviews - why risk it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cologne arrived today, and to my surprise, it does appear to be legitimate.  The cologne box was neatly wrapped in professional looking plastic wrap, and there were no obvious signs of the box being previously opened.  The bottle itself looks effectively identical to the bottle I own, with the exception of a serial number sticker being in a slightly different place.  The cologne smells like it should, and I perceive it to be of similar strength to my department store bought bottle.  I sprayed the shirt I was wearing about 3 hours ago, and then took it off to change into my exercise clothes.  I just double checked the shirt, and it smells good as I would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, my order (fulfilled by Loving Life Perfumes) appears to be legitimate.  This cologne definitely deserves 5 stars for its great smell, and great value.</li>
            <li> My husband has been out of cologne for some time.  On a recent shopping trip came across Versace in a display.  Fell in love with it.  The price on Amazon was much less than at the mall.  It came in about 3 days.  My husband loved it also. Because it is a better quality product, the fragrance lasts for hours. Showed it to college-aged co-worker and had to order a bottle for him as well. He had compliments from 2 females the first night he wore it.  My opinion is that anyone would love it!</li>
            <li> Shipped Fast Great Product</li>
            <li> Smells great compliments all around</li>
            <li> HAPPY WITH MY LOTION MY HUISBAND WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY !!!</li>
            <li> I never learn from from my mistakes from buying perfume online ,I thought Amazon same as Macy&#x27;s ,but its way different ,I was at Macy&#x27;s the other day and tried this on my hand ,I went home and all night the smell on my hand ,i ordered online from Amazon and since I got it and did the same what I did at the department store ,just few minutes after that I hardly can smell it ,and when first spray you smell alcohol only same as cheap cologne .This explain it half price as it is at Macy&#x27;s or Sephora  . It&#x27;s 100% not original and just wonder how many customers rated this 5 starts .</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery...now about the cologne, it&#x27;s my primary go-to. I love the scent. Women simply adore it, only a little bit is needed. Just a few sprays and it lasts hours even when in a club or bar scene...Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. Get tons of compliments. Nothing like it. Wish i had bought this more sooner than i did , but still this cologne is filthy.</li>
            <li> Great product. Seems genuine. Came fast and was packed well.</li>
            <li> Great scent that can work for almost any setting, though meant for the summer and warmer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity is an issue with me however. After 2 hours, the smell becomes extremely weak. I&#x27;ve experimented this with lotion and that seems to improve longevity slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, amazing scent!</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift from amazon.com directly. It was the REAL THING!!! Was afraid to purchase because of the many fakes out there. Quality product from versace.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne.  YESS!</li>
            <li> This cologne is not the best aroma I have tried. Of course a lot has to do with my body chemicals. Sometimes it hard to find the right match in colognes.</li>
            <li> Great deal- shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!  Excellent smell!-  Very Clean!  It came in its box and everything. It is not overpowering and it last through-out the day- I spray about 4-5 sprays.</li>
            <li> It smells so wonderful. Lasts a long time</li>
            <li> The women love to smell me.  nuf said....</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before, this is my first time buying online and it was water down. it doesnt hold the scent like in the past.</li>
            <li> Never fails to get compliments when im out. At the bars the women love it. Well worth the $40 I spent for ot.</li>
            <li> Received the item with no damage.  It was shipped earlier than expected through amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragrance.  Great smell. Similar to DG light blue for women... but with a more manly and aquatic scent. Great for spring and summer.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband - fresh, clean scent - he likes &amp; so do I ! ! !</li>
            <li> Love this smell! So clean and professional, can&#x27;t wait to purchase more!!</li>
            <li> This is typically much more expensive at any store. This product was exactly what I expected and exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes ever made!. I love it, ideal for formal and informal occasions</li>
            <li> right time as described</li>
            <li> this is a great smelling product. I have bought this for years and everyone else seems to like it as well.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend.... smells fake. Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I order this colonge for my husband every two or three months.  So I am very familiar with how it should smell.  This is the second time I have ordered and received it and it does not smell as it should.  It smells watered down or perhaps it got hot and and the heat diluted the fragrance.  For whatever reason it is bad and not usable.  I will again throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go the Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom&#x27;s to purchase it there so I can make sure the smell is OK.  I pay more for it at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom - and that is why I would perfer to order it online - but if I cannot rely on it being usable it is not worth the amount of money saved.</li>
            <li> Received this item very quickly and when I got it, it was much larger than I expected, this will last my brother in law all year.</li>
            <li> I searched all over for this cologne for my two sons and it was sold out almost everywhere else. I was so glad that I found it here and the price was great- better than the other sites I went to.</li>
            <li> Every man needs to smell like this! Smells light and beautiful. Any man who wants to turn on a woman must get this! Same goes for any woman that wants to be turned on by her man;)</li>
            <li> I got this perfume as a gift for my husband, and he loved it! also the price was great, much cheaper than in any other store!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to over apply this cologne. It isn&#x27;t heavy or cloying. It has a very clean and crisp smell that is almost aquatic. There is a subtle sweetness to it from the citrus notes. Definitely reminds me of summer and the ocean. It has a freshness to it that can&#x27;t be beat. A scent that is good for all seasons and all occasions. The perfect gift to buy any special guy. The bottle is nice looking too.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell a lot, and it was an excellent price. Also it arrived on time, actually earlier than it said.</li>
            <li> I first bought this cologne in the duty free shop when we were on our way home from Paris for a birthday gift.  My boyfriend has been wearing it every since and always gets compliments.  It&#x27;s a soft, fresh scent and you can&#x27;t beat the price here.  I paid far less on Amazon and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back when he needs more.</li>
            <li> Sort of weak from the last one I purchase.</li>
            <li> Good price on my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I got my bottle today and I just want to confirm that it is real ,not a fake ,as many are writing here.&lt;br /&gt;It has same serial number on the box and the bottle and nothing has been tempered with either of them.&lt;br /&gt;I checked serial number online and it says it was manufactured in April of 2014.&lt;br /&gt;As for 4 stars ,well I didn&#x27;t like the opening and after a while when it is dried out it smells much better, maybe because it is summer fragrance so I will see how it smells during hot summer days.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is real.</li>
            <li> This is freaking amazing! 100% authentic and fast shipping. Purchase through Discount Perfumes!!</li>
            <li> Great product and arrival time on time. I would buy again</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely get noticed wearing this stuff. It&#x27;s not an overpowering smell, but it is &amp;#34;commanding&amp;#34; and lasts a long time. Must have for your collection.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li> My teenage grandson smelled this cologne at a local chain store and wanted it for Christmas.  The price locally was exorbitant  so I checked on Amazon and the price was less than half of what I would have to pay locally!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it! My Versace Eau Fraiche cologne was EXPIRED! It was old so the strength of the cologne was very very weak. I immediately threw it away. It&#x27;s better to just go ahead and buy it from the department store. I wish I did because I wasted my time and money on this. Or if you can find it some place else cheaper then by all means do it, but keep in mind you run the risk of buying expired/old/stale product like I did. Thank goodness I bought it for myself and not as a gift for someone else. Would&#x27;ve been bad.</li>
            <li> YUM! YUM!  My hubby loves it and I love it even more!  It&#x27;s soft, yet masculine..........how can you go wrong.</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance that you are going to have to try on before buying because it&#x27;s picky. On my skin, this fragrance lasts 20 minutes; 30 tops. And it&#x27;s really close to the skin. It was so bad that I thought this was a counterfeit product. I mean, I just couldn&#x27;t smell it!&lt;br /&gt;But I went to a Macy&#x27;s and tried it on... same thing! 20 minutes tops.&lt;br /&gt;This is a summer fragrance, and as such I have tried it on when it&#x27;s 80 degrees out and when it&#x27;s 60 degrees without much variation in the results.&lt;br /&gt;But, on some people, this fragrance sticks to their skin for DAYS! And the projection they get is incredible. So, I would definitely recommend trying this on before buying. It is a nice, fresh, happy smell; but try it on to see how it suits your skin.</li>
            <li> smell great. love to buy for others. This was also a gift and extremely hard to give a 20 summary.</li>
            <li> Not sure on the authenticity of this. If I try a sampler at the mall I can smell it for days. This particular bottle only lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> this is obviously a counterfeit Cologne. however it does smell pretty close to the real thing the problem is it dissipates quickly</li>
            <li> Warning if you wear it they will come!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells fantastic- it&#x27;s intoxicating.  I def love it on my husband, too.  I would def recommend it to anyone (given they also like the scent) and it lasts most of the day!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new cologne,was getting tired of the same ol thing. I wanted a scent that was clean,and not like everyone else. This does just that without being over powering. Great choice and price from a great seller. Delivery was fast.If anyone out there is looking for a great deal on great products,you&amp;#34; Must &amp;#34;check out this seller! Thanks!</li>
            <li> The bottle came on time, is NOT old smelling or quick fading, and people like it.(if you wearing this or other colognes to get noticed look no further). Only con is it is not CH Chic or Armani Code; honestly you should look at buying one of those two before you look here.(They are well liked).</li>
            <li> After going out in Chicago&#x27;s Boystown, I knew I needed new cologne ASAP. This bottle has lasted forever, and with its soft yet herbaceous, masculine scent, you don&#x27;t go unnoticed. This is a cologne you can wear home to mom and out to the clubs.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. product was legit and as stated. shipping was great</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, something really special and unusual.</li>
            <li> The smell of this cologne is absolutely amazing &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Great quality and scent.</li>
            <li> Smells AWESOME! Very fresh, and scent lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance ! Have bought many times. Look at Wal-mart for better prices though.</li>
            <li> great price for size of bottle</li>
            <li> Does not look original, the smell does not last long...not sure if its the Original....my worst purchase ever done on amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Versace Man Eau Fraiche for years now and I absolutely love it! The scent lasts all day and it&#x27;s affordable. Department stores and outlets sell this fragrance in the $60-70 range but Amazon is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Quite simply the best smelling mens fragrance on the market. I own Jimmy Choo Man and Versace Pour Homme as well and Versace Man blows them out the water. Lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s a mediocre product. For the price I like it, but the scent doesn&#x27;t stick around as long as I&#x27;d like to. For some that&#x27;s great because they prefer a faded, more subtle smell.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite cologne,would order it again....</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for 5+ years now and it&#x27;s still my favorite cologne.  For all seasons and all occasions.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, own two of them, great price + fast shipping, great quality will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my son and he loves it.  This is his second bottle. The kid has great taste.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me as a gift.  There are not a lot of mens colognes that I like but this one smells clean, not fruity or over baring.  I have received a lot of complements on it and my wife said its sexy.</li>
            <li> My nephew loves it!!!</li>
            <li> Ship on date.good item.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne a couple of years ago from Macy&#x27;s.  I loved it then and can&#x27;t remember why I waited so long to buy it again.  This is a great summer cologne and I always receive tons of compliments when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine through Amazon and it was 100% as I remember and completely authentic.  Mine also came with a bonus 3.4oz shower gel.  The value through Amazon should make anyone question why pay a department store price when you can get the same cologne from Amazon for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance an the ladies love it too. Not strong just a nice fresh smell I recommend any man to pick this item up!</li>
            <li> When looking for something special for my son for Christmas, my husband suggested this cologne. My son loved the scent.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for a friend, yes would recommend this for men who like a crisp fresh wood smell. Price was great also.</li>
            <li> smells like heaven - a must buy for any male out there....after several use, it&#x27;d become your natural scent even when you use it.</li>
            <li> The packaging is finest . I can&#x27;t describe how good it smells .I can suggest this product to everybody. I enjoy it every time i use it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and my husband loved it! Would order again it came in a timely fashion and I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells AMAZING! It is by far the best scent on the market. I was a bit skeptical at first because I read reviews stating the product had been tampered with. However, if you buy directly from Amazon, you can expect superb results. The cologne was exactly as it should be. I definitely recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> this perfume had used on other occasions and well, but I just bought this when I wear it, the scent does not last more than 30 minutes, so I am not satisfied with the purchase, I feel that I paid for a perfume falsified.</li>
            <li> The smell don&#x27;t last longer then 30 min.  If u don&#x27;t want to see disappointment in the eyes of your men, don&#x27;t buy it here!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the perfume.. but does not last longer than few hours. I was expecting it to last for longer time.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband. This is all he will wear now. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> I like the scent very much.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I was told by many people from friends to coworkers to random people on the street in stores etcm that this one of the best smelling colognes they&#x27;ve ever smelled , its a very fresh clean cut smell that lasts long people notice the smell at a good distance . I would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments on this one.  Cerruti Image was my regular one for a long time and then I switched to Versace, which I think is a fair bit more sexy.  The way I discovered it was interesting.  I smelled it on a guy, and then got a sample in the mail like a week later and was thinking &amp;#34;wow, now I know the name of it!&amp;#34; and bought a bottle the next week.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the quality and price of the product.</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift.  I have been thanked three times for this gift.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend it to others!&lt;br /&gt;Fell in love with it as soon as I opened the product.&lt;br /&gt;Similar to the one I bought in Macys!</li>
            <li> Came super duper fast, was freaking out cause I bought it a Week before valentines day and it showed up perfect timing, before valentines day even thought it said it would come after on the 18. And it was affordable and smelt perfect.</li>
            <li> So I was a little skeptical about this being &#x27;authentic&#x27; by reading some of the reviews here, but when I saw it was ordered and shipped by Amazon I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong, because I trust they Amazon sells genuine products and this was not shipped by a 3rd party as others seem to have been reporting that&#x27;s how they were ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased to see when I opened my order for just a 3.4oz bottle of this Versace Eau Fraiche bottle, that instead not only was that 3.4oz bottle included, but it was tucked away nicely inside of complete Versace travel set, with bonus 3.4oz shower gel in a nicely appointed box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire package was sealed, un-tampered with and the box had a complete UPC with correct origin verbiage, and the spray bottle itself was properly serial #&#x27;d. I will upload a couple of pictures to this post of what I received. Again, I got more than I paid for. I only paid for a 3.4oz bottle of this cologne, and what I got was much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time buying Versace cologne for myself. I&#x27;m typically a Nautica, Cool Water, Chrome, Boucheron, Tommy, CK kind of guy. I actually bought this fragrance &#x27;scent-unsmelled&#x27; (think &#x27;sight-unseen&#x27;) which I have never done before. I mean really, who buys a fragrance without smelling? Well I did, because I was too lazy to fight the mall traffic to sample this fragrance at a department store, and try to be persuaded by a pushy salesperson into buying it, along with 5 other colognes which I probably could use, but not have the cheddar for. Not to mention, it probably would have been cheaper buying off Amazon anyway, plus I got upgraded to the travel kit. BONUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the scent. I&#x27;m not going to sit here and tell you it has notes of sandalwood, a piqued palate of persimmon and hints of hazelnut. I&#x27;m no good with those things. I can tell you it&#x27;s just a light, fun, a little sweet but still masculine scent that I expect to have hoards of women flocking to. I passed my ex-wife in the store the other day, and I know if I was wearing this instead of whatever horrid concoction I sprayed on myself from the glued-on testers in the fragrance section, she would have looked twice. But not because of me, but the scent. She hates me actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I just wanted to throw a quick review of this handsome set that I received, which included the 3.4oz spray and a 3.4oz shower gel / body wash in a nice travel set box, for only paying for a 3.4oz bottle. I&#x27;m pretty sure something got mixed up somewhere, but for once I got a bonus in my shipment! I may order this again from Amazon just to see if I get another travel set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Prime member, and I ordered this on Saturday evening and received the following Tuesday. Very happy once again with another successful Amazon purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT** Amazon won&#x27;t let me add a customer pic to this listing, so I uploaded 3 pics of what I received. Check the comments to this post for the links :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!sed my ex-wife in the store the other day, and I know if I was wearing this instead of whatever horrid concoction I sprayed on myself from the glued-on testers in the fragrance section, she would have looked twice.

            <li> The ladies dig the scent!  Only need 1 or 2 sprays and lasts hours without having an overly strong scent.</li>
            <li> This cologne is absolutely wonderful.  It is not overly woody, but a clean scent.  The aroma is fresh, it&#x27;s sensual, exciting.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it and would buy it as a gift with confidence.</li>
            <li> Smells good! I bought this for my husband. He liked it and I like to smell it on him. Yum.</li>
            <li> One of the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever used. I used to buy the Voyage from Hermes, but now this become my favorite.</li>
            <li> ++:} What can you say it&#x27;s Versace Cologne. I Love it!!!!! Nice clean and manly scent. Awesome price! The scent stays and lasts a very long time which is a great quality when you like the scent obviously.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Loved it the first day I smelled it. And the price was reasonable too!</li>
            <li> This is my go to cologne for my husband. Great deal and fast delivery. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This has been my scent for years now. It smells really great without being too strong. Excellent sillage and longevity too.</li>
            <li> Love it good pricing .buy again from them</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. Very soft smell but still very masculine. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Everything good so far</li>
            <li> 17 yr old said all the girls love it on him.</li>
            <li> This was the real deal. Came sealed and authentic.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son. The cologne arrived fully intact and smells wonderful! This was a great deal for the amount!</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff for my bf. friends fell in love and I recommended them to buy it off of here and they did.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment. I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li> Great scent!!! Not floral at all.  Perfect for work or play.</li>
            <li> First of all those who say it does not last long obviously purchased a counterfeit bottle online. I am reviewing the cologne itself that I purchased from Sephora (the real deal). I wear it to work and even when I get off on an 8 hour shift the scent is still there. One day I went to work got off then went to a friends house 3 hours later and he asked me what cologne I was using. He smelt the scent 11 hours after I sprayed it on. The scent is not too strong but its enough to catch attention and it gives a whif of summer freshness its like a sweet citrusy smell. Dont spray more than 2 times or youll be \\&quot;that guy\\&quot; that wears too much cologne. One in the neck and one in the wrist does the job. This is the best cologne ive ever used.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift for my husband in valentines day he just loved it. it smell so good i just love it thank u so much guys i really appreciate it</li>
            <li> My lady finds it edible, so let&#x27;s be honest fellas, that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re wearing this stuff...it works. And its not so overpowering that you become THAT guy who makes everyone around him nauseous.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for years. Before I discovered this scent in the pages of a very manly magazine, I&#x27;ve always had a strange feeling as if I was missing something. A void in my soul. I am very manly. I look like a man. I taste like a man. I sound like a man. I feel like a man. Then I realized, I&#x27;ve never SMELLED like a man. The very first moment after the scent of this cologne went up my nose, and processed by my brain, I felt complete. It was a moment of ecstasy. Sort of like that final scene in 40 Year Old Virgin when Michael Scott finally put it in. I looked down at the page and saw the words VERSACE MAN. That was when I knew this was meant to be me.</li>
            <li> Brand new and sealed 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> 5 sprays of Versace before I go out, guaranteed to bring home a babe</li>
            <li> It was neatly packed but the serial number was different between the bottle and the box a big red flag, as I sprayed some, the smell was dramatically different from the same product I bought from Macy&#x27;s. I believe that the bottle was watered down the smell only lasting for about 30 minutes to an hour. DO NOT BUY IT FROM HERE save your money and buy it from Macy&#x27;s because it will only cost you 10-20 dollars more but the smell will last alot longer and so much better than this fake product.</li>
            <li> The moment I tried this cologne it smells like pure alcohol with the slightest hint of the real thing. It burns on contact and is definitely diluted with something. I should have read the other reviews about this product before I brought it.. It&#x27;s happened to others too. And by the way this item is non refundable or returnable because it is flammable or hazardous. Buyers beware</li>
            <li> My husband always wears Cool Water.  I think this scent is similar, but refreshing and new.  He likes it too!  I ordered from Amazon because it was 50% cheaper than buying in the store.  Why wouldn&#x27;t I get it online!?</li>
            <li> This one was the greatest ever. I loved the Fragrance I bought it for a gift and I know I love it. Great big box for a big bottle.</li>
            <li> Constantly get compliments on how good I smell. Love this stuff. I&#x27;d recommend it to any guy out there that&#x27;s how great it is</li>
            <li> Light clean scent perfect for summertime</li>
            <li> One of the best &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; fragrances on the market.  Non offensive and most people will find it very pleasing.  Very light, more of a summer day scent.</li>
            <li> Satisfied! Love the smell and so does my wife!</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Smell really great perfect gift</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing and everybody compliments my boyfriend on it</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance. My first time purchase of this cologne. Not over powering. Can&#x27;t comment on the lasting strength because I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Versace Man Eau Fraiche for a while now through Amazon. While I have no complaints about Amazon or the sellers, I do have a warning. If you are used to this fragrance, the formula appears to have changed to a weaker and more diluted version of its former self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After noticing the projection and longevity to be significantly diminished in my last few bottles ordered on-line, I gave up. I decided that I would just go to a department store and pay the full price. At two reputable locations I noticed the same differences with my all time favorite fragrance. Amazon is not the problem. As with a few other fragrances I have enjoyed over time(Dolce &amp; Gabbana for example), there comes a time when the formula changes on a dime for no apparent reason and the difference is too noticeable to overlook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first time buying this fragrance perhaps you won&#x27;t notice the difference, but if it has been a favorite of yours beware. It now consistently seems to be diluted and with about an hours longevity and very little projection. Before it was exceptional in both and less \\&quot;woody\\&quot; on the dry down.</li>
            <li> Smells great, the packaging was all original and it came the very next day. (Only because it shipped near me) I couldn&#x27;t be any happier.</li>
            <li> I got this product on time,and i lobe this perfume,my friend recommended me this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;And the price was less then in the store</li>
            <li> THE BOYFRIEND REALLY LIKED IT.</li>
            <li> Perfect service ,can&#x27;t ask for me.</li>
            <li> Been using it before i bought this one. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Amazon and received an authentic product. I want to keep my review short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne has a very pleasant fruity aroma. I recommend this for everyday use. It is perfect for a hot summer day on the beach. If you are looking for something more formal, you should look elsewhere (May I suggest Jaguar Black, Kenneth Cole, and Jaguar for men). It suits best younger men.</li>
            <li> Now u talk about a great smelling cologne!! Wow!! Now this is by far my front runner of cologne here!! Smells awesome!! A must have!! Received lots of compliments from the ladies as well from my co workers as well!! Gianni Versace may u rest in peace!! You were the best!!!</li>
            <li> Best product to get and it smells good and its the best cologne I ever smelled</li>
            <li> Recipient loved it!  This was a gift to my nephew who wanted it more than a new car.  I can&#x27;t rate it first-hand as a user myself.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what my husband wanted</li>
            <li> Love it and so does my wife.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery! Great item!</li>
            <li> Great price ! Usually would buy at Macy&#x27;s for double the price. I was skeptical thinking at this price it was going to be a fake. But  I compared the one from macys with the one I just got off amazon and it&#x27;s exactly the same.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome, great summer/spring scent. It has an atmospheric quality to it, this loves warm weather especially if you&#x27;re by water. The scent smells odd during colder times of the year so I&#x27;d say strictly keep it for summer usage. It last all day, good projection without killing people. 2-3 sprays max and you&#x27;re good to go. I actually envy how well it projects, and lasts compared to the other colognes I won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price on here too, peace.</li>
            <li> Great scent and works perfect with just one spray on the chest under the shirt. It stays all day long and even blends with the natural body scent.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this and was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t meet a retail purchased cologne. The cologne came the day it was supposed to in good condition and it passed the expectations I had for it. Really great product, would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This actually never met my expectation and honestly,I was disappointed. The scent is somehow different from what I knew and this made me go back to the department store and get another one!</li>
            <li> Nice, fresh, crisp smell.  Great value. Bottle &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; cheap and plastic so nothing great there. I get compliments throughout the day on the smell so I guess its received well.</li>
            <li> This is my boyfriends new favorite cologne and mine too, and I can&#x27;t stop smelling him!</li>
            <li> Nice scent,nice look!</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with this product.  I have boughten it at Macy&#x27;s before and I loved the smell and how long it lasted.  With this product that I bought on Amazon you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing cologne after ten minutes.  I am not sure why but the quality of this product is very poor.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS.  I will gladly pay the extra money to buy this at a department store from now on so I know am getting a high quality product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cologne that has a distinct, but subtle smell. The person who wears it interacts with people daily and it is not an overbearing smell that leaves you with a headache.</li>
            <li> I love it! smells great!</li>
            <li> I feel as if the smell goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> smells great and lasts a long time, highly reccomend</li>
            <li> I bought this for my man and love the way it smells on him.  I have heard several complement on the way he smells.</li>
            <li> Smells so good. I love this</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE.  100% ALCOHOL.</li>
            <li> Voc√™ quis dizer: Excelente fragr√¢ncia&lt;br /&gt;excellent fragrance</li>
            <li> One of our favorites in the family. Always appreciated and the wonderful smell never gets old!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It smells very crisp and refreshing, like a man should. Girls love it too. Great product, great price. Highly recommend it.</li>
