            <li>but I find myself using this WNW palette way more</li>
            <li>I really love this neutral eyeshadow palette, which comes with 3 matte shades and 3 shimmery shades.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful natural colors that blend well.</li>
            <li>They are supper cheap, highly pigmented, beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>Easy to blend</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find a compact to be my go to product when I didn&#x27;t feel like lugging a lot of makeup around, but this doesn&#x27;t fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>The white shades aren&#x27;t chalky either, which is great.</li>
            <li>I used an eye primer to get the colors to pop but was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a discontinued item from WnW</li>
            <li>colors are rich and true to what they seem in the pic!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The colors are so lovely and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>shipping was super fast packaging was superb and i feel the palette should go up a few in dollars</li>
            <li>Super pigmented colors that allow you to make a variety of looks.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this palette, but I found it to be just ok.  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented! !</li>
            <li>The size is also perfect for those small bags!!</li>
            <li>They are smooth, apply well, and are really pigmented.</li>
            <li>it was worth the search.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I&#x27;m not wild about the shimmer side of this palette, but I love the matte colors!</li>
            <li>Great for a simple everyday or a sexy night look.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li>its very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>brings this one back one of my favorite neutral shadow palettes colors</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This allows you to create so many different eye looks with just one product.</li>
            <li>but we careful because they crack very easily.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much all</li>
            <li>Very highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>Really pigmented too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but they don&#x27;t really blend well like more expensive eye shadows.  </li>
            <li>, I own the naked palette by urban decay</li>
            <li>After I could not find this palette in my local stores, I searched Amazon and was excited to find it.  </li>
            <li>the matte colors in particular blend well and are very creamy.</li>
            <li>Its hard to believe that you can buy such great shades/product so reasonably.</li>
            <li>I love wet&#x27;n&#x27;wild eye shadows.</li>
            <li>it has the quality of high end shadows</li>
            <li>I often use this palette over my high end brands.</li>
            <li>This palette is highly recommended amongst YouTube makeup gurus.  </li>
            <li>There is very minimal to no fall-out during application and the shadows are really easy to blend or smoke out.</li>
            <li>Anyone looking for a basic, natural, and convenient palette should definitely purchase this! :)</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by this palette.</li>
            <li>When I got it first thought was &amp;#34;It&#x27;s smaller than I expected&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>So, naturally, I came here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it came highly recommended from some of the YouTube Gurus who use it on a regular basis for themselves or their clients.  </li>
            <li>I remember wearing Wet &#x27;n&#x27; wild as a pre-teen then a teenager I had not used it since then, I was taken aback to see the new colors and packaging it is not the wet-n-wild</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the 2 light colors, but the other colors compliment my skin tone for a everyday natural look.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to eyeshadow, I&#x27;m a golden brown complexion, so trying to find colors that work on my can be complicated.</li>
            <li> Hope I can continue to buy online for a long time.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been hooked on tutorials all summer long...)</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying some of their other kits and colors</li>
            <li> Also reviewed against MAC eye shadows which showed up the same if not better....</li>
            <li> I will be ordering the other palettes.</li>
            <li> Thought I would be in love with the matte side, and hate the shimmer side.</li>
            <li> I have since added other lipsticks and colors to my make-up collection!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after i saw a youtube video where someone was duplicating Kim Kardashians look for less.  </li>
            <li> Im struggling a little for a way to wear the mattes without them looking chalky on my NW45 skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this palette a few weeks ago because of a girl on YouTube.</li>
            <li> /will recommend to a friend for hard to find cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this.</li>
            <li> I was dead wrong.</li>
            <li> It actually shows with or without a base cream, recommend it you my girly friends</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t look too dramatic or glitzy on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Im so sad they no longer make this!</li>

            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this. But i am so glad that i did! The colors are so lovely and very pigmented. They lasted me all day and created most lovely smokey eye. I did use a primer though so do keep that in mind. if you want a great eye shadow palette for a great price then definitely consider getting this one! :)</li>
            <li> shipping was super fast packaging was superb and i feel the palette should go up a few in dollars it has the quality of high end shadows</li>
            <li> Beautiful highly pigmented colors. Great for a simple everyday or a sexy night look. I definitely would recommended this pallette because it compliments all shades of skin tones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this pallet!  It actually shows with or without a base cream, recommend it you my girly friends and they love it also.</li>
            <li> A really popular palette. Lovely colours to blend.Can be used day to day or for going out.Really pigmented too.I would definately recommend.</li>
            <li> Loving the colors. Stocking up! Easy to use and the brushes are perfect.  The size is also perfect for those small bags!!</li>
            <li> I often use this palette over my high end brands. the matte colors in particular blend well and are very creamy.</li>
            <li> Im so sad they no longer make this! Great colors! I had to order a second one, and it truly is my go to pallet! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Super pigmented colors that allow you to make a variety of looks.  A bit chalky (hence 4 stars instead of 5) but they still blend well.  With a primer, the color lasts all day, even through a workout!  This is a great kit for beginners or more advanced makeup addicts who just don&#x27;t want to break the bank looking for great products.  Looking forward to trying some of their other kits and colors</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow.  Very pigmented! !</li>
            <li> I have owned MAC, LORAC, Chanel and so many more types of palettes and this one puts them all to shame.  The pigmentation is spot on and there is no fall out.  The colors are perfect, especially for us blue-eyed gals.  I use every color in this palette.  I wish they had not discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by this palette. Theres lots of mentions online about it being a HG palette. When I got it first thought was &amp;#34;It&#x27;s smaller than I expected&amp;#34;. Wasnt sure how it would work out. Thought I would be in love with the matte side, and hate the shimmer side. I was dead wrong. It was the total opposite. The shimmer side is so perfect for a wearable neutral office look. These shadows are pigmented beyond belief. Im struggling a little for a way to wear the mattes without them looking chalky on my NW45 skin. Maybe I&#x27;ll lighten my application on them, and wear a primer underneath to bring the colors out more. Still though good palette.</li>
            <li> Hope wet and wild brings this one back one of my favorite neutral shadow palettes colors are pigmented and go on and blend well</li>
            <li> Love this palette.  Great color pay off, and I wish I could find this still in stores.  Hope I can continue to buy online for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love wet&#x27;n&#x27;wild eye shadows. They are supper cheap, highly pigmented, beautiful colors. Most of their palettes are very good.</li>
            <li> I brought this palette because of a tutorial I saw online. I could not find it anywhere and I searched and searched for weeks I finally ordered it from here. The colors are beautiful natural colors that blend well. I used an eye primer to get the colors to pop but was not disappointed. I was very impressed with the final look. I remember wearing Wet &#x27;n&#x27; wild as a pre-teen then a teenager I had not used it since then, I was taken aback to see the new colors and packaging it is not the wet-n-wild I remembered. I have since added other lipsticks and colors to my make-up collection!</li>
            <li> Had been looking all over for this as I could not find it in the store. it was worth the search. I use these neutral colors just about every day. i work in a office and these colors a perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I have had my eye on it for a while and I finally purchased it. I can do any look with the combination of matte and shimmer shadows. Shipping was also very fast. I believe it arrived to be in two days. I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Its my favorite palette, i love Wnw..im very impressed with the quality and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are rich and true to what they seem in the pic!&lt;br /&gt;Also its very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after i saw a youtube video where someone was duplicating Kim Kardashians look for less.  they recommended this and i purchased it.  The colors are nice, but they don&#x27;t really blend well like more expensive eye shadows.  But overall, I do like the palette&lt;br /&gt; and it serves it&#x27;s purpose for the price.</li>
            <li> i love this dam palett i will buy more soon love how the color pay off keep the coming &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this palette! That&#x27;s pretty much all there&#x27;s need to be said!&lt;br /&gt;The colors are gorgeous and for the price, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> The colors in this pallet are just to perfect. Very highly pigmented. Also reviewed against MAC eye shadows which showed up the same if not better.... I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a discontinued item from WnW but I now have 3 of them. I&#x27;m well stocked. Thank you WnW for this gorgeous pallet to create a nice brown smokey eye.</li>
            <li> The colors are matte and are so blendable.  Its hard to believe that you can buy such great shades/product so reasonably.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Exactly what I wanted. I will be ordering the other palettes. /will recommend to a friend for hard to find cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Very nice neutral palette.  Great for beginners like me.  Easy to blend but we careful because they crack very easily.  Love this palette.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this palette a few weeks ago because of a girl on YouTube. (I&#x27;ve been hooked on tutorials all summer long...) I searched for it at Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc. and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. So, naturally, I came here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is a must-buy because of the price, colors, and quality. I have used it every day this summer and I get a fantastic result! Anyone looking for a basic, natural, and convenient palette should definitely purchase this! :)</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;m not wild about the shimmer side of this palette, but I love the matte colors! I love nudes, I own the naked palette by urban decay but I find myself using this WNW palette way more and it was a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to eyeshadow, I&#x27;m a golden brown complexion, so trying to find colors that work on my can be complicated. This palette is a staple in my eyeshadow rotation. I don&#x27;t use the 2 light colors, but the other colors compliment my skin tone for a everyday natural look.</li>
            <li> I really love this neutral eyeshadow palette, which comes with 3 matte shades and 3 shimmery shades. This allows you to create so many different eye looks with just one product. You can create everyday natural looks or more dramatic looks. This product is great for beginners to experts and it&#x27;s great for travel as well because these 6 shades are really versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These shadows are all really good quality. They are smooth, apply well, and are really pigmented. The shimmery shades aren&#x27;t overly glittery nor do they contain chunky glitter so they don&#x27;t look too dramatic or glitzy on the eyes. The white shades aren&#x27;t chalky either, which is great. There is very minimal to no fall-out during application and the shadows are really easy to blend or smoke out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it came highly recommended from some of the YouTube Gurus who use it on a regular basis for themselves or their clients.  After I could not find this palette in my local stores, I searched Amazon and was excited to find it.  Thank you for this palette.  It has beautiful neutral and highlighting colors that are favorable for any skin tone.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This palette is highly recommended amongst YouTube makeup gurus.  I purchased one for myself and another one for my daughter.  This is a great neutral palette!!!</li>
