            <li>: The dye goes on easily and the foam is amazing.</li>
            <li>but Im in love with the color</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming chemical odour and it leaves your hair feeling healthy and not stripped after dying.</li>

            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE it</li>
            <li>The package was well done, though my mail carrier shoved it into my tiny box rather than put it in the package mail box, but the dye was perfectly in tact.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair came out a lovely rosey brown.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok, it works for me</li>
            <li>I love it and it was insanely easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I know for a fact that Japanese products are really good and this product is no exception!</li>

            <li>I had dark brown hair and this color showed up beautifully!</li>
            <li>Super love this brand.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great product for Asian hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the box showed that my hair should come out real reddish which was worrying me, it&#x27;s actually a really nice</li>
            <li>Very fun product to dye your hair.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I love how easy it was to use and the color came out really well.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair blonde 6 months ago, and dyed a neutral brown over it, but because of those golden undertones my hair had a more orangey tint to it than rose.</li>
            <li>The color, for me, was true to the color on the box.</li>
            <li>True to box color.</li>
            <li>True color</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and not damage your hair as much as another hair dye products</li>
            <li>The whole process was so easy.</li>
            <li>Easy, fast, full coverage and pretty color.</li>
            <li>Even though the color cant be saw clearly when you are staying indoor, I hope it could turn out more color</li>
            <li>product would be perfect for people with dark hair and/or red undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It always gives me consistent results.</li>
            <li>Almost exactly like the model on the box but a bit darker.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>so I re-dyed it the same color and my hair looks how I have it pictured (although it looks more brown in person than my cell phone camera).</li>
            <li>The color is so pretty.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply the foam all over and still had plenty left over (saved it temporarily in</li>
            <li>It has nice pinkish hue but the overall color is soft brown.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product my hair didn&#x27;t change too much</li>
            <li>It really does its job in matching the color</li>
            <li>I really like the color of this product.</li>
            <li>(I have medium-dark brown hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t take color very well).</li>
            <li>I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Version: Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>had very light brown hair for 2-3 months and dark root is coming through, made me having that &#x27;pudding head&#x27;</li>
            <li>First of all, I wouldn&#x27;t use this product if you have blonde hair, or golden undertones in your hair.</li>
            <li>It doesnt dry out ur hair very much, easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely color for females, I believe the rosy brown color would go really well with Asian skin tone with a bit yellow undertone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can see the color and the foam clearly as you apply, and lathering it into your hair is easy and mess free, I spilled some on my counter and wiped it clean 5 mins later and no stain was left.</li>
            <li>I had waited for a long time, but it&#x27;s worth for everything.</li>
            <li>It camr out like a medium red at first</li>
            <li>Although I wanted my hair color to turn out like the color shown on the model, I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t be as light because of my dark hair.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed there would not be enough dye.</li>
            <li>I apparently didn&#x27;t google translate the label right, so I only find out when I applied it.</li>
            <li>This is lovely color with brown and mix with little bit red.</li>
            <li>but so far it made my hair shinier and softer unlike when I do my hair coloring in the salon.</li>
            <li>After getting used to having a different hair color, I like it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So be ready to get the product with all Japanese instructions.</li>
            <li>No mess</li>
            <li>After dying it (applied my roots first and left it on for about 30 minutes total), the color came out as shown on the model.</li>
            <li>usually liese dyes will show their true color in a week after a lot of washing.</li>
            <li>It did take a lil long to come but since its directly from Japan I cant complain.</li>
            <li>You can see the pink tone in both natural and artificial light very well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It always gives me consistent results. I have very dark Asian.</li>
            <li> I love it! My hair is not damaged from this product at all. Kao Liese Is the best hair color. It&#x27;s easy to use and it smells good. I used only 1 box for my thick and long hair. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product line again!</li>
            <li> Super love this brand. It&#x27;s my nth try using this brand with different colors. It really does its job in matching the color it says on the box. I looked Japanese when I tried on this hair color. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it bec it&#x27;s in Japanese but so far it made my hair shinier and softer unlike when I do my hair coloring in the salon. I know for a fact that Japanese products are really good and this product is no exception! I will have to give this a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I had waited for a long time, but it&#x27;s worth for everything.</li>
            <li> A+++great item and love it!</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this product. Easy to apply and not damage your hair as much as another hair dye products</li>
            <li> So I loved oh this came out, I had a light brown hair color before dye it this rose brown color. It camr out like a medium red at first but it fadded away now its just a caramel brown color. I love it and it was insanely easy to apply. It did take a lil long to come but since its directly from Japan I cant complain. Ive had it colored for about 3 months and I already have like an 1 1/2 inches of dark roots but Im in love with the color and  its a good product</li>
            <li> I love this product! color is wonderful and it doens&#x27;t harm my hair, too!</li>
            <li> Although I wanted my hair color to turn out like the color shown on the model, I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t be as light because of my dark hair. Nonetheless, I love how easy it was to use and the color came out really well. I will definitely buy this again to touch up my roots!</li>
            <li> The product arrived 10 days earlier than the earliest expected delivery date! It worked perfectly on my black hair and the color turned out just like what&#x27;s shown on the box. Definitely a great product for Asian hair.</li>
            <li> Very fun product to dye your hair. The after-effect is pretty nice. I had black hair and I got a shining chocolate brown color. It&#x27;s reddish brown under strong lighting and subtle dark brown with softer lighting. After getting used to having a different hair color, I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is shipped from Japan, so it took some time which I already knew when buying it. So be ready to get the product with all Japanese instructions. I watched the instruction on the Singapore website. So no big deal. Btw, the little packet is conditioner, not shampoo. I apparently didn&#x27;t google translate the label right, so I only find out when I applied it.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely color for females, I believe the rosy brown color would go really well with Asian skin tone with a bit yellow undertone.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second time to use this color, and third time using KAO Prettia, it is so convenient.</li>
            <li> I got the package about a month ago before I decided to redo my hair last night and write the review.&lt;br /&gt;I had very light brown hair for 2-3 months and dark root is coming through, made me having that &#x27;pudding head&#x27; haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the box showed that my hair should come out real reddish which was worrying me, it&#x27;s actually a really nice color.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kinda like medium brown with a tint of pink. And I love it! Almost exactly like the model on the box but a bit darker.&lt;br /&gt;But usually liese dyes will show their true color in a week after a lot of washing. So, I might still have a chance to have red head. I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see!</li>
            <li> First of all, I wouldn&#x27;t use this product if you have blonde hair, or golden undertones in your hair. I dyed my hair blonde 6 months ago, and dyed a neutral brown over it, but because of those golden undertones my hair had a more orangey tint to it than rose. To fix this I mixed a rosey shade of Manic Panic to correct the tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would be perfect for people with dark hair and/or red undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming chemical odour and it leaves your hair feeling healthy and not stripped after dying. The after colour care packet left my hair feeling silky and luxurious. I have another box on the way for touch ups!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use !! No mess&lt;br /&gt;But u have to leave it longer than 20-30 min to get the color !!</li>
            <li> color did not come out at all.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and easy application, but I recommend leaving it on for at least 45 min if your hair is dark.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product my hair didn&#x27;t change too much (I have medium-dark brown hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t take color very well). I waited about a month and for me the color washed out to a lighter shade one closer to the box. My roots were coming in so I re-dyed it the same color and my hair looks how I have it pictured (although it looks more brown in person than my cell phone camera). I think it&#x27;s a really cute color and I recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;1st and 2nd picture is how it looks in the shade&lt;br /&gt;3rd and 4th are in the sun</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast! I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous hair color was reddish brown (with natural hair being very dark brown). After dying it (applied my roots first and left it on for about 30 minutes total), the color came out as shown on the model. The whole process was so easy. It didn&#x27;t make any mess and the foam stayed on my hair. Also, the after color hair pack smelled good and it softened my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product. The color is so pretty. It has nice pinkish hue but the overall color is soft brown. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to purchase again when my roots start to show.</li>
            <li> For TLDR- Jump to the bottom of the wall of text.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: The shipping date said between Feb 27th to March 20th, I was as patient as possible, but eventually I emailed them and asked for faster shipping or information as to when it was/will be shipped. I promptly got a reply that my order had already shipped. It arrived today, Feb. 17th, 10 days sooner than it&#x27;s earliest estimated date. The package was well done, though my mail carrier shoved it into my tiny box rather than put it in the package mail box, but the dye was perfectly in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dye: The dye goes on easily and the foam is amazing. At first it seemed there would not be enough dye. I have shoulder length very thick hair. I usually need 2 boxes nearly of normal american dyes. I was able to apply the foam all over and still had plenty left over (saved it temporarily in case I missed a spot.) You can see the color and the foam clearly as you apply, and lathering it into your hair is easy and mess free, I spilled some on my counter and wiped it clean 5 mins later and no stain was left. I let it sit for about an hour before rinsing. I had dark brown hair and this color showed up beautifully! The conditioner smells amazing and the scent lasts a while in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: The color, for me, was true to the color on the box. My hair came out a lovely rosey brown. You can see the pink tone in both natural and artificial light very well. Having pale skin, I was curious if it would make my face look red but it actually looks very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am VERY pleased with this product and it&#x27;s shipping and I will be buying again when it&#x27;s time to re-dye in a few months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR Version: Fast shipping. Easy to use product. True to box color. Compliments pale skin tone. Great results!</li>
            <li> True color but make sure you follow instruction! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The shipping arrived sooner than the expected date. This is my 3rd time I dye my hair by myselfat home (cuz it is cheaper than in salon) and Kao is the best hair dye product I have ever tried. It doesnt dry out ur hair very much, easy to use. This is lovely color with brown and mix with little bit red. Even though the color cant be saw clearly when you are staying indoor, I hope it could turn out more color but it&#x27;s ok, it works for me and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Easy, fast, full coverage and pretty color. Love it !!!</li>
