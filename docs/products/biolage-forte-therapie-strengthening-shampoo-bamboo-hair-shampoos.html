            <li>purchased this product with my own funds.</li>

            <li>It was a nice shampoo</li>
            <li>I love to see people with shiny hair, as I think that it indicates health and good grooming.  </li>

            <li>So if there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m looking for in a shampoo, it would be to make my hair more healthy.</li>
            <li>Just love this shampoo, it was a great buy and fast service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can still get this product - Biolage Fortify via Amazon.</li>

            <li>MY HAIR ALWAYS FEELS BETTER WHEN I USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>I feel my hair is healthier, more shiny and probably stronger than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I use more</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s bouncy and light!  </li>
            <li>Love it!onvert</li>
            <li>when I bought this before at a reputable hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is way too strong, also.</li>
            <li>I started using the Matrix creme in a jar instead of hot oil treatments with great success and decided to buy this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It was shipped fast and got here in good condition.</li>
            <li>It has a very light clean scent to it</li>
            <li>The original is review below, be sure to read the update at the</li>
            <li>Leaves hair shiny and manageable, easy to brush.</li>
            <li>as it may, my hair is naturally fairly strong.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is nice, unless you want to shampoo your head first.</li>
            <li>have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair  be healthier and appear a bit more full.</li>
            <li>it is really nice and soapy and lends itself very nicely to lather other body parts besides your scalp.</li>
            <li>This is fine with me through</li>
            <li>My hair is now strong, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the biolage products, but the very first time I used the strengthening shampoo and conditioner set my hair immediately started breaking off.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair bouncy and light.</li>
            <li>The smell is a plus, light and airy.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and very accurate product description.</li>
            <li>I love it ready to re order it!</li>
            <li>I would recommend a natural/eco friendly shampoo and conditioner instead.</li>
            <li>So I want to make sure it&#x27;s as strong and healthy as possible before I turn it over to a person struggling with cancer.</li>
            <li>So I want to make sure it&#x27;s as strong and healthy as possible before I turn it over to a person struggling with cancer.</li>
            <li>think the strengthening claim is probably true.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell more than any other shampoo, and love the way my hair feels after.</li>
            <li>used to love this shampoo and still do as I find my hair being clean, soft, and manageable after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having a huge debate about getting another bottle when this one is finished, or moving over to Aveda, which i&#x27;ve recently fell in love with.</li>
            <li>But, I ordered this and so far have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Matrix wins twice for me.</li>
            <li>This is effective, but I don&#x27;t like to use this every day to possible damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>So, I have used many products (including a flat iron) to try to get that shiny look which does not come naturally to fine and color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Biolage Strengthening Shampoo has a kind of Bamboo Scent which is very mild and slight.</li>
            <li>I would give it 4 stars, maybe even 5, if I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to use so much to get my hair clean.</li>
            <li>If your hair is damaged and fragile this is a great product for repair and bringing its strength back.</li>
            <li>Made my hair soft and strong again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the shampoo in my bottle is for super dry hair.</li>
            <li>this is the first shampoo that I have found that does not leave my scalp feeling itchy or flaky.  </li>
            <li>There are many such products on the market</li>
            <li>It is thick, goes where you want it to go, and seems to do a great job of getting out oils and sweat and dirt.</li>
            <li>Most of hair&#x27;s strength comes from your diet, if you&#x27;re eating enough protein and so on.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at Costco and the difference in my hair has been night and day.</li>
            <li>The cap on the smaller bottle is better.</li>
            <li>This is an issue in part because I like it below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear</li>
            <li>hot water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After several uses it feels even better.</li>
            <li>I wonder if this is related to my scalp feeling better or some unrelated property of the shampoo?</li>
            <li>Either way the result is the same - more hair staying on my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want to have it look as healthy as possible while reinforcing the strength, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>used the Lanza product line (Color Care or Moisturizing) on a daily basis and love it.  </li>
            <li>I find it a very pleasant scent and subtle compared to most other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Most other shampoos would require two or even three passes before my hair really felt clean.</li>
            <li>I expect I could go through more than a 33.8oz bottle of Biolage Strengthening shampoo with a single 8.5oz</li>
            <li>And certainly this shampoo does seem to help.</li>
            <li>but it gets tiring trying to find the combo pack with the large size shampoo &amp; conditioner together on sale so buying them online</li>
            <li>I think this product is a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; of real Matrix product.&lt;br /&gt;First off,</li>
            <li>but it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>This is a very lightweight shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the high price, using much less than other products I&#x27;ve tried makes these a very good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I blow dry and straighten my hair more than not but also let it dry naturally curly and using this Shampoo &amp; Conditioner in combination with putting in some Tigi Bed Head Serum while my hair is still wet works great on preventing frizz.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair clean and I can see a big change on its strength!</li>
            <li>several uses I&#x27;ve noticed my hair seems to look and feel clean for longer.  </li>
            <li>With my below shoulder-length hair I need only a Susan B Anthony dollar coin sized blob of shampoo to get my hair clean on one pass.</li>
            <li>I bought this after I ran out of the first bottle and it is the exact same quality.</li>
            <li>a result of using this product, in combination with the Strengthening conditioner and Hydra-Seal Leave-in Conditioner, my hair is super shiny but yet bouncy at the same time!  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine, color treated hair and this shampoo leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Still, you could say that brushing out long hair will stress it and having it even slightly stronger will always be good.</li>
            <li>As with the conditioner I was able to feel a noticeable thickness develop after a few days of using this.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair and usually have great luck with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>so you get the new growth coming out and now the strengthening shampoo can protect it before it gets to that breaking point?</li>
            <li>I went on the hunt for a new shampoo I would like</li>
            <li>I am amazed and am a convert - this is my new hair preferred hair care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- this is my new hair preferred hair care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older.</li>
            <li>Its pretty universal.</li>
            <li>so I thought this would help to curb the damage that the perms cause, but it did the exact opposite of what the label says.</li>
            <li>recommend to anyone with fine hair, short or long.</li>
            <li>Previous shampoos I used needed more product and usually 2 passes to get my hair clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old female to has fine, wavy, brown hair which is colored blonde, and cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the hair was just too far gone to be helped?</li>
            <li>Meant to buy the conditioner version of this, but that it obviously completely my fault for not reading.  </li>
            <li>and it works well even for my blonde hair in VERY hard-water.  </li>
            <li>Only wondering how much longer I can get it from here even unless Biolage changes their minds based on sales and re-issues these.</li>
            <li>IT FEELS THICKER AND SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>After an incident with the Nexus shampoo that was pretty strange (you can read in my review of [[ASIN:B00AE07FUE Nexxus Youth Renewal Shampoo]])</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a more expensive product I get better value by using less and saving time and</li>
            <li>the packaging, mainly the bottle is a bit different, like</li>
            <li>It used to be much more sudsy and workable, so I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula recently.</li>
            <li>has saved me a ton of time running around the city to different salons trying to find a decent deal on this particual type of Biolage Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>After on going damage from coloring my hair (covering the gray), I can see a major improvement!</li>
            <li>I have already reordered it (this is the large size) which I plan to use to refill the individual tube which is smaller and easier to manuever in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I have already reordered it (this is the large size) which I plan to use to refill the individual tube which is smaller and easier to manuever in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Some of this may be due to my hair being more managable resulting in less breakage and fewer split ends.</li>
            <li>It is less foamy than other shampoos yet gets my hair feeling very clean in one wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll note just to be clear though that I only use the strengthening shampoo - not the conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll note just to be clear though that I only use the strengthening shampoo - not the conditioner.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s in the bottle is NOT what is marked on the outside.</li>
            <li>I could accomplish this shine with the Lanza Moisturizing or Smoothing line, but my hair felt heavy and by the end of the day (if it was really hot), looks a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have damaged hair and this really helps strengthen my hair and with less break-offs, my hair grows longer faster.</li>

            <li> The smell is a plus, light and airy.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and very accurate product description.</li>
            <li> I love it ready to re order it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend a natural/eco friendly shampoo and conditioner instead.</li>
            <li> So I want to make sure it&#x27;s as strong and healthy as possible before I turn it over to a person struggling with cancer.</li>
            <li> So I want to make sure it&#x27;s as strong and healthy as possible before I turn it over to a person struggling with cancer.</li>
            <li> think the strengthening claim is probably true.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell more than any other shampoo, and love the way my hair feels after.</li>
            <li> used to love this shampoo and still do as I find my hair being clean, soft, and manageable after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a huge debate about getting another bottle when this one is finished, or moving over to Aveda, which i&#x27;ve recently fell in love with.</li>
            <li> But, I ordered this and so far have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Matrix wins twice for me.</li>
            <li> This is effective, but I don&#x27;t like to use this every day to possible damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> So, I have used many products (including a flat iron) to try to get that shiny look which does not come naturally to fine and color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Biolage Strengthening Shampoo has a kind of Bamboo Scent which is very mild and slight.</li>
            <li> I would give it 4 stars, maybe even 5, if I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to use so much to get my hair clean.</li>
            <li> If your hair is damaged and fragile this is a great product for repair and bringing its strength back.</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft and strong again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the shampoo in my bottle is for super dry hair.</li>
            <li> this is the first shampoo that I have found that does not leave my scalp feeling itchy or flaky.  </li>
            <li> There are many such products on the market</li>
            <li> It is thick, goes where you want it to go, and seems to do a great job of getting out oils and sweat and dirt.</li>
            <li> Most of hair&#x27;s strength comes from your diet, if you&#x27;re eating enough protein and so on.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at Costco and the difference in my hair has been night and day.</li>
            <li> The cap on the smaller bottle is better.</li>
            <li> This is an issue in part because I like it below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear</li>
            <li> hot water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several uses it feels even better.</li>
            <li> I wonder if this is related to my scalp feeling better or some unrelated property of the shampoo?</li>
            <li> Either way the result is the same - more hair staying on my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want to have it look as healthy as possible while reinforcing the strength, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used the Lanza product line (Color Care or Moisturizing) on a daily basis and love it.  </li>
            <li> I find it a very pleasant scent and subtle compared to most other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Most other shampoos would require two or even three passes before my hair really felt clean.</li>
            <li> I expect I could go through more than a 33.8oz bottle of Biolage Strengthening shampoo with a single 8.5oz</li>
            <li> And certainly this shampoo does seem to help.</li>
            <li> but it gets tiring trying to find the combo pack with the large size shampoo &amp; conditioner together on sale so buying them online</li>
            <li> I think this product is a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; of real Matrix product.&lt;br /&gt;First off,</li>
            <li> but it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> This is a very lightweight shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the high price, using much less than other products I&#x27;ve tried makes these a very good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair more than not but also let it dry naturally curly and using this Shampoo &amp; Conditioner in combination with putting in some Tigi Bed Head Serum while my hair is still wet works great on preventing frizz.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair clean and I can see a big change on its strength!</li>
            <li> several uses I&#x27;ve noticed my hair seems to look and feel clean for longer.  </li>
            <li> With my below shoulder-length hair I need only a Susan B Anthony dollar coin sized blob of shampoo to get my hair clean on one pass.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I ran out of the first bottle and it is the exact same quality.</li>
            <li> a result of using this product, in combination with the Strengthening conditioner and Hydra-Seal Leave-in Conditioner, my hair is super shiny but yet bouncy at the same time!  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine, color treated hair and this shampoo leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Still, you could say that brushing out long hair will stress it and having it even slightly stronger will always be good.</li>
            <li> As with the conditioner I was able to feel a noticeable thickness develop after a few days of using this.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and usually have great luck with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> so you get the new growth coming out and now the strengthening shampoo can protect it before it gets to that breaking point?</li>
            <li> I went on the hunt for a new shampoo I would like</li>
            <li> I am amazed and am a convert - this is my new hair preferred hair care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - this is my new hair preferred hair care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older.</li>
            <li> Its pretty universal.</li>
            <li> so I thought this would help to curb the damage that the perms cause, but it did the exact opposite of what the label says.</li>
            <li> recommend to anyone with fine hair, short or long.</li>
            <li> Previous shampoos I used needed more product and usually 2 passes to get my hair clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old female to has fine, wavy, brown hair which is colored blonde, and cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the hair was just too far gone to be helped?</li>
            <li> Meant to buy the conditioner version of this, but that it obviously completely my fault for not reading.  </li>
            <li> and it works well even for my blonde hair in VERY hard-water.  </li>
            <li> Only wondering how much longer I can get it from here even unless Biolage changes their minds based on sales and re-issues these.</li>
            <li> IT FEELS THICKER AND SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> After an incident with the Nexus shampoo that was pretty strange (you can read in my review of [[ASIN:B00AE07FUE Nexxus Youth Renewal Shampoo]])</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a more expensive product I get better value by using less and saving time and</li>
            <li> the packaging, mainly the bottle is a bit different, like</li>
            <li> It used to be much more sudsy and workable, so I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula recently.</li>
            <li> has saved me a ton of time running around the city to different salons trying to find a decent deal on this particual type of Biolage Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> After on going damage from coloring my hair (covering the gray), I can see a major improvement!</li>
            <li> I have already reordered it (this is the large size) which I plan to use to refill the individual tube which is smaller and easier to manuever in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have already reordered it (this is the large size) which I plan to use to refill the individual tube which is smaller and easier to manuever in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Some of this may be due to my hair being more managable resulting in less breakage and fewer split ends.</li>
            <li> It is less foamy than other shampoos yet gets my hair feeling very clean in one wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll note just to be clear though that I only use the strengthening shampoo - not the conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll note just to be clear though that I only use the strengthening shampoo - not the conditioner.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s in the bottle is NOT what is marked on the outside.</li>
            <li> I could accomplish this shine with the Lanza Moisturizing or Smoothing line, but my hair felt heavy and by the end of the day (if it was really hot), looks a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have damaged hair and this really helps strengthen my hair and with less break-offs, my hair grows longer faster.</li>
            <li> This will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it makes my hair just as shiny as if I had used my flat iron!  </li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair on a daily basis, so you know it should be dry.</li>
            <li> went through several other shampoos that didn&#x27;t work out before I came across Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Due to health reasons, I lost some of my hair earlier this year and it has thinned in the front.  </li>
            <li> My problem isn&#x27;t usually breakage, but with it being nearly waist length, my issue is with tangles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I&#x27;ve found is I need even less product than I started with, especially with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> (you can almost smell nothing, but it smells a bit minty when wet - no smell at all when dry).  </li>
            <li> I use the same amount of this product as I do with other shampoos but you can probably get away with using less -</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much so be careful not to overload.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, in my case I&#x27;m donating my hair to charity and someone could be wearing the hair for years and years.</li>
            <li> Also plan to reorder the spray as I&#x27;m not into the other ones.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as foamy as some other shampoos</li>
            <li> I actually bought this two years ago (before I started using Lanza) but never tried it - not sure why.  </li>
            <li> My biggest gripe is that it isn&#x27;t very sudsy and if my hair is especially dirty or oily, it takes two passes to get it clean.</li>
            <li> But, later, I had a hard time finding this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that there&#x27;s less hair in my brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Black and get my hair relaxed every 3 months</li>
            <li> This means I use less so even through</li>
            <li> There is less of my hair cloging the shower drain and less ending up in my hair brush than before.</li>
            <li> I keep trying less shampoo</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length dyed hair and am very active.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like a tangled mess, and I would not recommend this product for damaged, african-american hair.</li>
            <li> My hair never looks limp or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the cap, it is a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li> since a little before Christmas 2013.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased quite a few bottles of this on here.</li>
            <li> On the days I don&#x27;t wash it, I rinse it after heavy exercise.</li>
            <li> and I keep learning I need less!</li>
            <li> Use it with just a small amount of the strenghing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The strengthening shamp/cond was hard to find where i had purchased before @</li>
            <li> It is not too thick and there is never a build up in my hair or on my scalp.</li>
            <li> So if you aren&#x27;t having a serious problem, I might not recommend this at the price they charge.</li>
            <li> Say your hair was really weak.</li>
            <li> YOU CANT GO WRONG ESP AT THIS PRICE .</li>
            <li> If you have an awful diet, I&#x27;m not sure any amount of strengthening shampoo can then repair the frail hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo stripped my hair and made it impossible to run my fingers through my hair while shampooing.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is the first shampoo that I have found that does not leave my scalp feeling itchy or flaky.  My hair is soft and manageable.  Use it with just a small amount of the strenghing conditioner.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Bought for a Christmas gift.  Received product with no problem.  Wrapped and under the tree.</li>
            <li> A year ago, or so, I was at my mother in law&#x27;s home and used a product like this in the shower.  I liked what it did for my hair - no separate shampoo and conditioner.  But, later, I had a hard time finding this.  So, upon research, I found that they had changed the name. I don&#x27;t know if they actually changed the product.  But, I ordered this and so far have been pleased with the results.  There are many such products on the market so when you find something you like, you might want to stay with it.</li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize good in summer but I recommend a hydrating during winter.  I noticed no difference in strength of hair.</li>
            <li> Matrix shampoo is great. I try to use it when I can. I thought this was a good deal so I got it. This will last me a long time. It was shipped fast and got here in good condition.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start using the Matrix Biolage series for the shampoo. I started using it for the conditioner, because I needed a detangling conditioner. After trying just about everything I could find, and working my way up the cost progression, I was thrilled when I hit the Biolage Detangling solution and it worked *perfectly*. That then made me wonder about using their matching shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t have a detangling shampoo. But they do have a strengthening shampoo. Texture wise, it has the same great aspects as the solution does. It is thick, goes where you want it to go, and seems to do a great job of getting out oils and sweat and dirt. It gets your hair thoroughly clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on the question of whether it *strengthens* - I don&#x27;t know how you could test that. Say your hair was really weak. Now say you used this and it still broke. Maybe the hair was just too far gone to be helped? Maybe you have to use it for months so you get the new growth coming out and now the strengthening shampoo can protect it before it gets to that breaking point? Most of hair&#x27;s strength comes from your diet, if you&#x27;re eating enough protein and so on. If you have an awful diet, I&#x27;m not sure any amount of strengthening shampoo can then repair the frail hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be that as it may, my hair is naturally fairly strong. My problem isn&#x27;t usually breakage, but with it being nearly waist length, my issue is with tangles. Still, you could say that brushing out long hair will stress it and having it even slightly stronger will always be good. So if there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m looking for in a shampoo, it would be to make my hair more healthy. And certainly this shampoo does seem to help. I&#x27;d say that there&#x27;s less hair in my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does cost a lot. So if you aren&#x27;t having a serious problem, I might not recommend this at the price they charge. On the other hand, in my case I&#x27;m donating my hair to charity and someone could be wearing the hair for years and years. So I want to make sure it&#x27;s as strong and healthy as possible before I turn it over to a person struggling with cancer. So I am willing to do my very best to have it strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll note just to be clear though that I only use the strengthening shampoo - not the conditioner. For the conditioner I use the detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product with my own funds.ears.

            <li> I love Biolage and all of its shampoo and conditioning products! I&#x27;ve purchased quite a few bottles of this on here. Leaves my hair bouncy and light. I hate the feel of greasy hair! I blow dry and straighten my hair on a daily basis, so you know it should be dry. This product keeps the moisture locked in and is awesome! The smell is a plus, light and airy. I would reccommend if you want to have a quality shampoo or conditioner that you can rely on, to use this.</li>
            <li> this stuff is really good , my hair was falling all the time , when i started using this ( i had my hair cut ) really really short . it almost stopped falling off . but you have to wait some time to see results .</li>
            <li> Just love this shampoo, it was a great buy and fast service. The smell of this shampoo is great too!</li>
            <li> I think this product is a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; of real Matrix product.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the packaging, mainly the bottle is a bit different, like&lt;br /&gt;the cap. And the label on the bottle. I don&#x27;t remember it having an actual&lt;br /&gt;LABEL when I bought this before at a reputable hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is way too strong, also. All this shampoo did was flatten out my hair&lt;br /&gt;and did not strengthen it!! Same goes for the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Meant to buy the conditioner version of this, but that it obviously completely my fault for not reading.  Regardless, I am using this and it works well even for my blonde hair in VERY hard-water.  As with the conditioner I was able to feel a noticeable thickness develop after a few days of using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can still get this product - Biolage Fortify via Amazon. Quality still a plus.Only wondering how much longer I can get it from here even unless Biolage changes their minds based on sales and re-issues these. Also plan to reorder the spray as I&#x27;m not into the other ones.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s very good for your hair and smells great. Good product.  A must buy!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this- and I do too- it is really nice and soapy and lends itself very nicely to lather other body parts besides your scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at Costco and the difference in my hair has been night and day. I bought this after I ran out of the first bottle and it is the exact same quality. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Matrix must have changed their formula because this doesn&#x27;t work like at all like the Biolage strengthening shampoo I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> This is a really good Shampoo and most of Matrix Biolage products are. If your hair is damaged and fragile this is a great product for repair and bringing its strength back. It doesn&#x27;t take much so be careful not to overload. I would recommend to anyone of any race. Its pretty universal.</li>
            <li> 3.75 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to love this shampoo and still do as I find my hair being clean, soft, and manageable after using the shampoo. My biggest gripe is that it isn&#x27;t very sudsy and if my hair is especially dirty or oily, it takes two passes to get it clean. It used to be much more sudsy and workable, so I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula recently. I do love the smell more than any other shampoo, and love the way my hair feels after. I would give it 4 stars, maybe even 5, if I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to use so much to get my hair clean. I&#x27;m having a huge debate about getting another bottle when this one is finished, or moving over to Aveda, which i&#x27;ve recently fell in love with.</li>
            <li> Just isn&#x27;t the same stuff as it was.</li>
            <li> The product works great for my hair.  I have damaged hair and this really helps strengthen my hair and with less break-offs, my hair grows longer faster.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair clean and I can see a big change on its strength! I love it ready to re order it!</li>
            <li> have been using this for years and it always works great. you cant beat the quality for the price. Amazon is the way to buy this type of product.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s in the bottle is NOT what is marked on the outside. I have fine thin hair and usually have great luck with this shampoo. However it&#x27;s left me with crunchy greasy hair as if I&#x27;ve not washed it in a month. The product looks like a conditioner but does lather like shampoo. I&#x27;m pretty sure the shampoo in my bottle is for super dry hair. I would not recommend purchasing from this seller.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the cap, it is a little flimsy.  The cap on the smaller bottle is better. Also a bottle this big should have a pump.</li>
            <li> Easy on colored hair!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and very accurate product description.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shampoo. I got the conditioner with a shampoo barcode label. Conditioner is nice, unless you want to shampoo your head first. Enough said.</li>
            <li> I love it! After on going damage from coloring my hair (covering the gray), I can see a major improvement! My hair is now strong, shiny and smooth. And I bought it at a great price! Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> My hair salon on Newbury Street in Boston was using this for years and I loved the results and smell of it!  It is a salon quaility product and great for strenthening your hair.  I blow dry and straighten my hair more than not but also let it dry naturally curly and using this Shampoo &amp; Conditioner in combination with putting in some Tigi Bed Head Serum while my hair is still wet works great on preventing frizz.  I go out of my way to try to find this in stores but it gets tiring trying to find the combo pack with the large size shampoo &amp; conditioner together on sale so buying them online has saved me a ton of time running around the city to different salons trying to find a decent deal on this particual type of Biolage Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  My husband likes using this product too.  Its a nice clean smell that is great for anyone.</li>
            <li> This shampoo stripped my hair and made it impossible to run my fingers through my hair while shampooing.  My hair felt like a tangled mess, and I would not recommend this product for damaged, african-american hair.</li>
            <li> I can not believe this has lasted a year! It smells good and works well. It is not too thick and there is never a build up in my hair or on my scalp. I have long, fine, color treated hair and this shampoo leaves my hair very soft and manageable. My hair never looks limp or weighed down. Over all, I&#x27;m buying it again. :)</li>
            <li> Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo,... Great Pproduct</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Made my hair soft and strong again.</li>
            <li> ITS BIOLAGE NEED I SAY MORE....PRICE IS GREAT WILL DEF BUY SOME MORE... MY HAIR ALWAYS FEELS BETTER WHEN I USE THIS PRODUCT. IT FEELS THICKER AND SO SOFT. GET IT YOU CANT GO WRONG ESP AT THIS PRICE .</li>
            <li> Last week my hairdresser commented on how silky my hair felt. Now that&#x27;s a compliment. I have shoulder length dyed hair and am very active. I wash my hair every other day. On the days I don&#x27;t wash it, I rinse it after heavy exercise. I also use a blow dryer and curling iron on it. So my hair gets lots of abuse. I started using the Matrix creme in a jar instead of hot oil treatments with great success and decided to buy this shampoo. I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the biolage products, but the very first time I used the strengthening shampoo and conditioner set my hair immediately started breaking off. I&#x27;m Black and get my hair relaxed every 3 months so I thought this would help to curb the damage that the perms cause, but it did the exact opposite of what the label says.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone with fine hair, short or long. Leaves hair shiny and manageable, easy to brush.</li>
            <li> This is what I use daily to strengthen my hair / don&#x27;t use conditioner - just this shampoo - it works</li>
            <li> The original is review below, be sure to read the update at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair  be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using [[ASIN:B00AE07FUE Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo]] which I got via Amazon Vine to review.  It was a nice shampoo but I didn&#x27;t like the scent. After an incident with the Nexus shampoo that was pretty strange (you can read in my review of [[ASIN:B00AE07FUE Nexxus Youth Renewal Shampoo]]) I went on the hunt for a new shampoo I would like better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through several other shampoos that didn&#x27;t work out before I came across Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo. As it seems a system I also purchased and used the [[ASIN:B003XY6I74 Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner]] .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biolage Strengthening Shampoo is very nice indeed. It is less foamy than other shampoos yet gets my hair feeling very clean in one wash. Most other shampoos would require two or even three passes before my hair really felt clean. This means I use less so even through it&#x27;s a more expensive product I get better value by using less and saving time and hot water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With below-shoulder length hair I use enough to cover about 1/3 of my palm - maybe 1/2 ounce (I&#x27;m guessing). After shampooing I was pleased to find my scalp felt nice. After several uses it feels even better. I didn&#x27;t realize my scalp was feeling so irritated till it was feeling better! Bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over several uses I&#x27;ve noticed my hair seems to look and feel clean for longer.  I wonder if this is related to my scalp feeling better or some unrelated property of the shampoo? I don&#x27;t know but I consider this another happy plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biolage Strengthening Shampoo has a kind of Bamboo Scent which is very mild and slight. I find it a very pleasant scent and subtle compared to most other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. This is fine with me through I would be happiest with no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be updating my review with how well the \\&quot;strengthening\\&quot; part works on my hair. So far so good. I hope this is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Jan 29, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo and [[ASIN:B003YUVSW2 Matrix Biolage Strengthening Conditioner]] since a little before Christmas 2013. I feel my hair is healthier, more shiny and probably stronger than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the strengthening claim is probably true. There is less of my hair cloging the shower drain and less ending up in my hair brush than before. Some of this may be due to my hair being more managable resulting in less breakage and fewer split ends. Either way the result is the same - more hair staying on my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I&#x27;ve found is I need even less product than I started with, especially with the conditioner. I use about 1/8th the amount of conditioner compared to shampoo. I expect I could go through more than a 33.8oz bottle of Biolage Strengthening shampoo with a single 8.5oz [[ASIN:B003YUVSW2 Matrix Biolage Strengthening Conditioner]] tube. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the high price, using much less than other products I&#x27;ve tried makes these a very good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: June 3, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Still really happy with Matrix Biolage Strengthening shampoo and conditioner. I keep trying less shampoo and I keep learning I need less! With my below shoulder-length hair I need only a Susan B Anthony dollar coin sized blob of shampoo to get my hair clean on one pass. It isn&#x27;t as foamy as some other shampoos but it cleans very well. Previous shampoos I used needed more product and usually 2 passes to get my hair clean feeling. Matrix wins twice for me. Scratch that - three times as it saves water too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful!r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> Along with the strengthening conditioner it makes hair feel wonderful. The strengthening shamp/cond was hard to find where i had purchased before @ JC penney salon. They said they had the Fortifying instead, and was probably the same?? But I found the strengthening on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;So wanted to stick with what I knew worked for my aging, course, graying hair.You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years and i love the way it make my hair look and feel!</li>
            <li> best shampoo in the world</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old female to has fine, wavy, brown hair which is colored blonde, and cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  I love to see people with shiny hair, as I think that it indicates health and good grooming.  So, I have used many products (including a flat iron) to try to get that shiny look which does not come naturally to fine and color-treated hair.  This is effective, but I don&#x27;t like to use this every day to possible damage to my hair. Due to health reasons, I lost some of my hair earlier this year and it has thinned in the front.  I want to have it look as healthy as possible while reinforcing the strength, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Lanza product line (Color Care or Moisturizing) on a daily basis and love it.  I actually bought this two years ago (before I started using Lanza) but never tried it - not sure why.  When I found it in the closet last month, I thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use this every day after using the Matrix Strengthening Conditioner and Hydra-seal Leave-in cremer.  This is a very lightweight shampoo.  I shampoo my hair daily, and follow up with the Strengthening conditioner.  It has a very light clean scent to it (you can almost smell nothing, but it smells a bit minty when wet - no smell at all when dry).  I use the same amount of this product as I do with other shampoos but you can probably get away with using less - it&#x27;s just my personal preference to have a lot of lather so I use more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of using this product, in combination with the Strengthening conditioner and Hydra-Seal Leave-in Conditioner, my hair is super shiny but yet bouncy at the same time!  I could accomplish this shine with the Lanza Moisturizing or Smoothing line, but my hair felt heavy and by the end of the day (if it was really hot), looks a bit greasy.  I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it makes my hair just as shiny as if I had used my flat iron!  And, it lasts all day.  And, it&#x27;s bouncy and light!  I am amazed and am a convert - this is my new hair preferred hair care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, great product for fine hair - I have already reordered it (this is the large size) which I plan to use to refill the individual tube which is smaller and easier to manuever in the shower.  Love it!onvert - this is my new hair preferred hair care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, great product for fine hair - I have already reordered it (this is the large size) which I plan to use to refill the individual tube which is smaller and easier to manuever in the shower.

            <li> I LOVE the smell of Biolage products, and I would have loved this, until I researched all the chemicals used in it. I would recommend a natural/eco friendly shampoo and conditioner instead.</li>
            <li> I liked everything about it; good shampoo, didn&#x27;t come damaged or used. It is just as it says it is!</li>
