            <li>Great shipping speed :-)</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Fit my 7 year-old passably well and mostly stayed in place for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;Not a very attractive wig.  </li>
            <li>I Love it!</li>
            <li>My granddaughter will love this!</li>
            <li>Make sure you order in plenty of time if you need it!</li>
            <li>I have to say, the quality of this wig is better than I could have imagined!  </li>
            <li>it looks JUST LIKE the photo, fits great and doesn&#x27;t tangle so easily.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for!!!!</li>
            <li>We needed to use some Bobby pins to secure it to my 8 year olds head, but it worked great.</li>
            <li>Fit great.</li>
            <li>Looked kind of raggie on arrival</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lay as nice as the pictures look.</li>
            <li>Nice wig for children&#x27;s costume.</li>
            <li>Wig was awesome and really life like like Elsa.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look as nice as the picture</li>
            <li>We used the wig cap and pined them to their heads and they stayed on nicely for trick or treating.</li>
            <li>Not as nice as the picture.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty wig, beautiful in fact.</li>
            <li>very easy to do.  </li>
            <li>and we could not get a good fit</li>
            <li>and it was a good fit.  </li>
            <li>After some practice, our daughter is even able to put the wig on by herself with none of her own hair showing.  </li>
            <li>This fits my 3 &amp; 1/2 year old perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It is good quality for the price and with a little styling will look great!  </li>
            <li>If you have to have an Elsa wig, this will do, but there might be better options out there.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>and I just make sure I wear a nude hair cap underneath.  </li>
            <li>I had to clip my hair to be able to wear it.</li>
            <li>looks okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Way Better</li>
            <li>The Top Of The Wig</li>
            <li>Which Means They Should Of Put More Hair On The Top.</li>
            <li>Front is just ok.</li>
            <li>so one can order appropriately.  </li>
            <li>If I can find something else that will work better, I will return.</li>
            <li>My daughter (7) received more compliments.  </li>
            <li>Love the quality.  </li>
            <li>This wig is very well made and was a great value.</li>
            <li>It does not come styled on top</li>
            <li>If you want that, though, you&#x27;ll probably have to spend more than $20 for a wig.</li>
            <li>The wig was OK.</li>
            <li>I have to use many bobby pins to keep it in place</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast and it looks wonderful!</li>
            <li>Also came with a pretty good wig cap.</li>
            <li>but it looks pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>First let me say that the customer service from this seller was good.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I do not know where to find a good Elsa wig.  </li>
            <li>Really needs work to look that good.</li>
            <li>again I am going to have to really work the styling to make it look good.</li>
            <li>The wig is great, good quality, the front part is a little tricky to style, but it&#x27;s a very good product overall!</li>
            <li>Hair falls out of braid easily.  </li>
            <li>Seller was easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>Seams can be seen and hair falls out easily.  </li>
            <li>We call it &amp;#34;The Mullet&amp;#34; fine for a child&#x27;s Halloween costume, (yes, the wig is child size.</li>
            <li>Beautifully made wig, but would only fit a child.  </li>
            <li>The only good part about was it came exactly on time, not that it did any good</li>
            <li>The reviews for this wig were pretty good, and the price very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable sizing strap is awesome and provides for a pretty good range of head sizes from large to average to small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was cheap and it shows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fantastic or anything, but it was perfect with my costume for my cousins birthday party.</li>
            <li>The wig made the costume and helped me win third place in a contest.</li>
            <li>Maybe would fit a child</li>
            <li>Back of wig  is great.</li>
            <li>I thought it would fit.</li>
            <li>Shipping was free, but took about 4 weeks, as was estimated.  </li>
            <li>Took over a month to get And doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t put it on her head even if it fit for fear of the off gas.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive though and had free shipping</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t even fit on a head.  </li>
            <li>A bit heavy, but looks awesome!</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this wig, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would get here in time, seeing as it was being shipped from China, so I ordered a back-up.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have time to&lt;br /&gt;find and buy the original Elsa Dress</li>
            <li>This was a gift and she loved it, especially when she wears her Elsa dress.</li>
            <li>mine had a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>The hair is not as full, the braid is wimpy, etc.</li>
            <li>Or maybe I didn&#x27;t fit it on her right.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>its a bit more messy but the braid looks good.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>A tight fit even for a 7 year old but the braid part is wonderful</li>
            <li>A bit thin in the back, but great costume wig for the price, and came with a hair cap, so really great deal, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Took a little while to get but overal was great.</li>
            <li>really worth the wait...</li>
            <li>My 8 year old had to pull it way up on top of her head to cover her front hairline</li>
            <li>I made it looks so professional and so much better than it was when it arrived.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old tried it on and didn&#x27;t love it, but I think we&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a wig she DID like wearing.</li>
            <li>I cut most of them off, and it mainly fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>More for an adult</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s all right, and it worked for Halloween trick-or-treating.</li>
            <li>It worked for what we needed and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>My high school/college age employees cannot fit into it -</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit a normal size head</li>
            <li>Good thing it was dark.</li>
            <li>Needed a little styling but otherwise looked great straight from the box.</li>
            <li>Came super fast.</li>
            <li>Great quality wig for a costume but not really for a 5 year old.</li>
            <li>the braid on top has pretty much fallen completely out.</li>
            <li>Everyone thinks I&#x27;m really Elsa!</li>
            <li>It came on time, Oct. 30th for Halloween, and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This product looked exactly as shown here.  </li>
            <li>The wig looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter, 5, and it didn&#x27;t fit her head completely.  </li>
            <li>Looks like real hair!  </li>
            <li>Pretty</li>
            <li>Granted, when I put it on for the first time, it did, (as another reviewer mentioned)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit the head of a 4 year old child...</li>
            <li>Our was too much wig!</li>
            <li>Therefore, these short pieces flop around and make it look more like a punk rockers wig rather than an Elsa wig.  </li>
            <li>definitely won&#x27;t fit an adult.</li>
            <li>I don’t have big head, and it stated it’s a one size fits most adults, so</li>
            <li>Also, the sides are higher than what the picture shows, so if you&#x27;re going to use this for a grownup, you&#x27;d have to fix it so it covers your sideburns ..</li>
            <li>Barely fit my 6 soon to be 7 year old.</li>
            <li>would fit adult to child.</li>
            <li>Picture showed a grown woman wearing it and it barely fit my six year old.</li>
            <li>, picture is much better than actual product</li>
            <li>All ready shaped and braided, came in when the seller said it would!  </li>
            <li>It looks like it will fit my 6 year old for Halloween, but I am trying to keep it away from her until then</li>
            <li>Ordered this as a part of an Elsa costume, after reading many reviews about child sized wigs not being large enough for children over 2.  </li>
            <li>Nice wig but too big for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>I thought same maker (cosplay) and it also came from China, but quality not as great and fit way too small (or I wouldn&#x27;t care about quality as much).  </li>
            <li>First of all, it look absolutely nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li>It was a nice child&#x27;s wig but unless the child is around 2 years old it will not fit comfortably and cover all of the child&#x27;s existing hair.</li>
            <li>Soft and very pretty as an Elsa wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sparse-</li>
            <li>The quality is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Just have to play around to get it like the real elza.</li>
            <li>This was a better quality than I expected for a child&#x27;s wig.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unnatural-looking, but I&#x27;m a brunette, and it would be unnatural anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the moment i gentle took it out of its package it started to fall apart.</li>
            <li>They responded to my questions in a very prompt manner.</li>
            <li>Now, I realize that I didn&#x27;t pay much for this wig</li>
            <li>but I really feel like I was duped.</li>
            <li>Does not stay on head very well.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon and cosplay...</li>
            <li>look real of curse but do the job</li>
            <li>Liked the wig net that came with it too to hold my daughters hair back.</li>
            <li>Overall for a costume it will be fine since my sister isn&#x27;t as particular as I am.</li>
            <li>The pieces on the top and side are short so that it barely misses being incorporated into the braid.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I am not doing something right, but I am not sure she will be able to wear it.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as pretty as pictured, but worked for my 4 year old for Halloween.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is made for an adult, so I had to clip the back in order for it to fit on her head.</li>
            <li>It is just a bit more yellow than blonde and scratchy to the touch.</li>
            <li>but they look decent.</li>
            <li>Our high school students did a princess party as a fundraiser and one of the girls dressed up like Elsa.  </li>
            <li>If you have a large adult head don&#x27;t buy this wig.</li>
            <li>This wig looked absolutely adorable on her and the little girls were calling her Elsa.  </li>
            <li>The fit of the wig is quite small and I am going to have to work with styling it just right to get it to fit my sister&#x27;s adult head properly.</li>
            <li>Soft and flowing, feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>The crown of the wig is very sparse and wild looking.</li>
            <li>Looks great, but fails to stay on.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally buy wigs, so I&#x27;m no expert.  </li>
            <li>- we do not have a lot of experience with wigs, so maybe this is a normal thing…  </li>
            <li>The wig was great, other then the fact that it was smaller then expected.</li>
            <li>The hair color however is not the icy white one would expect for Elsa, it is more of a yellowy platinum blond, not what you see in their ad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that this was for my child, as it would never fit an adult.</li>
            <li>It is very soft.  </li>
            <li>and I would very much appreciate my money back!</li>
            <li>The wig arrived in a good condition, but was still very small, especially considering it is supposed to be adult size.  </li>
            <li>Ok I guess not very good quality</li>
            <li>The only problem is the top does not come down over the hairline.  </li>
            <li>It came with a hair net too which is a positive.</li>
            <li>The wig is less a french braid and more a mullet with a braid coming out of it.</li>
            <li>Starting to split a little on the top, but I&#x27;ve worn it tons of times now</li>
            <li>, this is on a 7 year old and there is no way for it to fit and cover the roots of her very dark hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought for my 5 year old and I am having trouble getting it to fit on her head.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter wore it)</li>
            <li>and the style has held up, with a 6 year old throwing it</li>
            <li>I got this for my 5 year old daughter to wear for Halloween.</li>
            <li>The wig doesn&#x27;t completely cover the hair.  </li>
            <li>It did not stay on my 4 years old daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old used this for Halloween.  </li>
            <li>Although is might fit a 22 inch head; it does not fit in depth.  </li>
            <li>For My 6 YR OLD.</li>
            <li>and so was my 5 year old.</li>
            <li>I purchased this wig along with the adult Elsa costume.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind this is supposedly for an adult,  and it fits my 4 yr old.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 7 year old niece</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t keep on a 8 year old head</li>
            <li>I got these for 5 and 6 year old girls Halloween costumes.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my niece to complete her frozen costume.  </li>
            <li>The purchase was for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>But unfortunately, the good review stops there.</li>
            <li>As most other reviewers say, it was pretty small, for 12 y/o head.</li>
            <li>Good wig, just a little small.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gift for a special little girl.</li>
            <li>The fit is VERY weird and the netting shows through the mullet hair on top.</li>
            <li>This wig is too small to completely fit my 7 year old grand-daughter.  </li>
            <li>This wig didn&#x27;t fit my daughter&#x27;s head, and she has a small head for her age (6).</li>
            <li>Not to mention the wig was plainly braided, nothing special about it, not anything like Elsa&#x27;s and was just held together with a piece of string.</li>
            <li>We did a lot of research, and found many reviews of other wigs stated over and over they were too small for even a 5 year old to wear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too late to get a replacement that would fit because of the lengthy shipping time.  </li>
            <li>We purchased this for our 7.5 yr old daughter, as an &amp;#34;Elsa wig&amp;#34; was the ONLY thing she asked for this Christmas!  </li>
            <li>I ordered it adult size because my Granddaughter wears the same size of hat that I do.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair on the top, the coverage is thin and the wig cap underneath does show through...</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews and buying it anyway, I was very apprehensive when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>It was big enough for my 12 year old as well.</li>
            <li>Soft silky hair, but extremely ill fitting.</li>
            <li>Thin, especially across the front but as a 9 year old&#x27;s Halloween wig it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>This was a replacement for a wig purchased at a costume store that was not a good fit.  </li>

            <li> Great shipping speed :-)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Fit my 7 year-old passably well and mostly stayed in place for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;Not a very attractive wig.  </li>
            <li> I Love it!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter will love this!</li>
            <li> Make sure you order in plenty of time if you need it!</li>
            <li> I have to say, the quality of this wig is better than I could have imagined!  </li>
            <li> it looks JUST LIKE the photo, fits great and doesn&#x27;t tangle so easily.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for!!!!</li>
            <li> We needed to use some Bobby pins to secure it to my 8 year olds head, but it worked great.</li>
            <li> Fit great.</li>
            <li> Looked kind of raggie on arrival</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lay as nice as the pictures look.</li>
            <li> Nice wig for children&#x27;s costume.</li>
            <li> Wig was awesome and really life like like Elsa.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look as nice as the picture</li>
            <li> We used the wig cap and pined them to their heads and they stayed on nicely for trick or treating.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as the picture.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty wig, beautiful in fact.</li>
            <li> very easy to do.  </li>
            <li> and we could not get a good fit</li>
            <li> and it was a good fit.  </li>
            <li> After some practice, our daughter is even able to put the wig on by herself with none of her own hair showing.  </li>
            <li> This fits my 3 &amp; 1/2 year old perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It is good quality for the price and with a little styling will look great!  </li>
            <li> If you have to have an Elsa wig, this will do, but there might be better options out there.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> and I just make sure I wear a nude hair cap underneath.  </li>
            <li> I had to clip my hair to be able to wear it.</li>
            <li> looks okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Way Better</li>
            <li> The Top Of The Wig</li>
            <li> Which Means They Should Of Put More Hair On The Top.</li>
            <li> Front is just ok.</li>
            <li> so one can order appropriately.  </li>
            <li> If I can find something else that will work better, I will return.</li>
            <li> My daughter (7) received more compliments.  </li>
            <li> Love the quality.  </li>
            <li> This wig is very well made and was a great value.</li>
            <li> It does not come styled on top</li>
            <li> If you want that, though, you&#x27;ll probably have to spend more than $20 for a wig.</li>
            <li> The wig was OK.</li>
            <li> I have to use many bobby pins to keep it in place</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast and it looks wonderful!</li>
            <li> Also came with a pretty good wig cap.</li>
            <li> but it looks pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> First let me say that the customer service from this seller was good.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I do not know where to find a good Elsa wig.  </li>
            <li> Really needs work to look that good.</li>
            <li> again I am going to have to really work the styling to make it look good.</li>
            <li> The wig is great, good quality, the front part is a little tricky to style, but it&#x27;s a very good product overall!</li>
            <li> Hair falls out of braid easily.  </li>
            <li> Seller was easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> Seams can be seen and hair falls out easily.  </li>
            <li> We call it &amp;#34;The Mullet&amp;#34; fine for a child&#x27;s Halloween costume, (yes, the wig is child size.</li>
            <li> Beautifully made wig, but would only fit a child.  </li>
            <li> The only good part about was it came exactly on time, not that it did any good</li>
            <li> The reviews for this wig were pretty good, and the price very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable sizing strap is awesome and provides for a pretty good range of head sizes from large to average to small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was cheap and it shows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fantastic or anything, but it was perfect with my costume for my cousins birthday party.</li>
            <li> The wig made the costume and helped me win third place in a contest.</li>
            <li> Maybe would fit a child</li>
            <li> Back of wig  is great.</li>
            <li> I thought it would fit.</li>
            <li> Shipping was free, but took about 4 weeks, as was estimated.  </li>
            <li> Took over a month to get And doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t put it on her head even if it fit for fear of the off gas.</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive though and had free shipping</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t even fit on a head.  </li>
            <li> A bit heavy, but looks awesome!</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this wig, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would get here in time, seeing as it was being shipped from China, so I ordered a back-up.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have time to&lt;br /&gt;find and buy the original Elsa Dress</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she loved it, especially when she wears her Elsa dress.</li>
            <li> mine had a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> The hair is not as full, the braid is wimpy, etc.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I didn&#x27;t fit it on her right.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> its a bit more messy but the braid looks good.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> A tight fit even for a 7 year old but the braid part is wonderful</li>
            <li> A bit thin in the back, but great costume wig for the price, and came with a hair cap, so really great deal, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get but overal was great.</li>
            <li> really worth the wait...</li>
            <li> My 8 year old had to pull it way up on top of her head to cover her front hairline</li>
            <li> I made it looks so professional and so much better than it was when it arrived.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old tried it on and didn&#x27;t love it, but I think we&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a wig she DID like wearing.</li>
            <li> I cut most of them off, and it mainly fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> More for an adult</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s all right, and it worked for Halloween trick-or-treating.</li>
            <li> It worked for what we needed and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> My high school/college age employees cannot fit into it -</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit a normal size head</li>
            <li> Good thing it was dark.</li>
            <li> Needed a little styling but otherwise looked great straight from the box.</li>
            <li> Came super fast.</li>
            <li> Great quality wig for a costume but not really for a 5 year old.</li>
            <li> the braid on top has pretty much fallen completely out.</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks I&#x27;m really Elsa!</li>
            <li> It came on time, Oct. 30th for Halloween, and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This product looked exactly as shown here.  </li>
            <li> The wig looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, 5, and it didn&#x27;t fit her head completely.  </li>
            <li> Looks like real hair!  </li>
            <li> Pretty</li>
            <li> Granted, when I put it on for the first time, it did, (as another reviewer mentioned)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit the head of a 4 year old child...</li>
            <li> Our was too much wig!</li>
            <li> Therefore, these short pieces flop around and make it look more like a punk rockers wig rather than an Elsa wig.  </li>
            <li> definitely won&#x27;t fit an adult.</li>
            <li> I don’t have big head, and it stated it’s a one size fits most adults, so</li>
            <li> Also, the sides are higher than what the picture shows, so if you&#x27;re going to use this for a grownup, you&#x27;d have to fix it so it covers your sideburns ..</li>
            <li> Barely fit my 6 soon to be 7 year old.</li>
            <li> would fit adult to child.</li>
            <li> Picture showed a grown woman wearing it and it barely fit my six year old.</li>
            <li> , picture is much better than actual product</li>
            <li> All ready shaped and braided, came in when the seller said it would!  </li>
            <li> It looks like it will fit my 6 year old for Halloween, but I am trying to keep it away from her until then</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a part of an Elsa costume, after reading many reviews about child sized wigs not being large enough for children over 2.  </li>
            <li> Nice wig but too big for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> I thought same maker (cosplay) and it also came from China, but quality not as great and fit way too small (or I wouldn&#x27;t care about quality as much).  </li>
            <li> First of all, it look absolutely nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> It was a nice child&#x27;s wig but unless the child is around 2 years old it will not fit comfortably and cover all of the child&#x27;s existing hair.</li>
            <li> Soft and very pretty as an Elsa wig.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sparse-</li>
            <li> The quality is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Just have to play around to get it like the real elza.</li>
            <li> This was a better quality than I expected for a child&#x27;s wig.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very unnatural-looking, but I&#x27;m a brunette, and it would be unnatural anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the moment i gentle took it out of its package it started to fall apart.</li>
            <li> They responded to my questions in a very prompt manner.</li>
            <li> Now, I realize that I didn&#x27;t pay much for this wig</li>
            <li> but I really feel like I was duped.</li>
            <li> Does not stay on head very well.</li>
            <li> thanks amazon and cosplay...</li>
            <li> look real of curse but do the job</li>
            <li> Liked the wig net that came with it too to hold my daughters hair back.</li>
            <li> Overall for a costume it will be fine since my sister isn&#x27;t as particular as I am.</li>
            <li> The pieces on the top and side are short so that it barely misses being incorporated into the braid.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am not doing something right, but I am not sure she will be able to wear it.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as pretty as pictured, but worked for my 4 year old for Halloween.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is made for an adult, so I had to clip the back in order for it to fit on her head.</li>
            <li> It is just a bit more yellow than blonde and scratchy to the touch.</li>
            <li> but they look decent.</li>
            <li> Our high school students did a princess party as a fundraiser and one of the girls dressed up like Elsa.  </li>
            <li> If you have a large adult head don&#x27;t buy this wig.</li>
            <li> This wig looked absolutely adorable on her and the little girls were calling her Elsa.  </li>
            <li> The fit of the wig is quite small and I am going to have to work with styling it just right to get it to fit my sister&#x27;s adult head properly.</li>
            <li> Soft and flowing, feels like real hair.</li>
            <li> The crown of the wig is very sparse and wild looking.</li>
            <li> Looks great, but fails to stay on.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy wigs, so I&#x27;m no expert.  </li>
            <li> - we do not have a lot of experience with wigs, so maybe this is a normal thing…  </li>
            <li> The wig was great, other then the fact that it was smaller then expected.</li>
            <li> The hair color however is not the icy white one would expect for Elsa, it is more of a yellowy platinum blond, not what you see in their ad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that this was for my child, as it would never fit an adult.</li>
            <li> It is very soft.  </li>
            <li> and I would very much appreciate my money back!</li>
            <li> The wig arrived in a good condition, but was still very small, especially considering it is supposed to be adult size.  </li>
            <li> Ok I guess not very good quality</li>
            <li> The only problem is the top does not come down over the hairline.  </li>
            <li> It came with a hair net too which is a positive.</li>
            <li> The wig is less a french braid and more a mullet with a braid coming out of it.</li>
            <li> Starting to split a little on the top, but I&#x27;ve worn it tons of times now</li>
            <li> , this is on a 7 year old and there is no way for it to fit and cover the roots of her very dark hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought for my 5 year old and I am having trouble getting it to fit on her head.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter wore it)</li>
            <li> and the style has held up, with a 6 year old throwing it</li>
            <li> I got this for my 5 year old daughter to wear for Halloween.</li>
            <li> The wig doesn&#x27;t completely cover the hair.  </li>
            <li> It did not stay on my 4 years old daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old used this for Halloween.  </li>
            <li> Although is might fit a 22 inch head; it does not fit in depth.  </li>
            <li> For My 6 YR OLD.</li>
            <li> and so was my 5 year old.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig along with the adult Elsa costume.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is supposedly for an adult,  and it fits my 4 yr old.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 7 year old niece</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t keep on a 8 year old head</li>
            <li> I got these for 5 and 6 year old girls Halloween costumes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece to complete her frozen costume.  </li>
            <li> The purchase was for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, the good review stops there.</li>
            <li> As most other reviewers say, it was pretty small, for 12 y/o head.</li>
            <li> Good wig, just a little small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for a special little girl.</li>
            <li> The fit is VERY weird and the netting shows through the mullet hair on top.</li>
            <li> This wig is too small to completely fit my 7 year old grand-daughter.  </li>
            <li> This wig didn&#x27;t fit my daughter&#x27;s head, and she has a small head for her age (6).</li>
            <li> Not to mention the wig was plainly braided, nothing special about it, not anything like Elsa&#x27;s and was just held together with a piece of string.</li>
            <li> We did a lot of research, and found many reviews of other wigs stated over and over they were too small for even a 5 year old to wear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too late to get a replacement that would fit because of the lengthy shipping time.  </li>
            <li> We purchased this for our 7.5 yr old daughter, as an &amp;#34;Elsa wig&amp;#34; was the ONLY thing she asked for this Christmas!  </li>
            <li> I ordered it adult size because my Granddaughter wears the same size of hat that I do.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair on the top, the coverage is thin and the wig cap underneath does show through...</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews and buying it anyway, I was very apprehensive when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> It was big enough for my 12 year old as well.</li>
            <li> Soft silky hair, but extremely ill fitting.</li>
            <li> Thin, especially across the front but as a 9 year old&#x27;s Halloween wig it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a wig purchased at a costume store that was not a good fit.  </li>
            <li> and so when I try to lift sections to make it curve like the picture, it pulls the braiding loose and is not easy to get it to look right.</li>
            <li> The hairs at the top of the wig are out of place, it&#x27;s too small to fit my 4-year-old&#x27;s head, and it smells so badly of chemicals</li>
            <li> Hopefully with some bobby pins and hairspray, I can try to tame those short locks and make it somewhat decent.</li>
            <li> The bangs need major styling though as to be expected since it was in a bag.</li>
            <li> It is a little big for my 9 year old daughter, but she loves it!</li>
            <li> Its way too small for a 3 yrs old!!!</li>
            <li> Did not fit a 18 year old head with short hair</li>
            <li> The wig needed some styling and was a little lower quality around the front (the widows peak, sideburns) but other than that, a very goo wig for the price</li>
            <li> The braid itself though is thick and full and the hair is tightly bound with no stray hairs.</li>
            <li> seems to be to small for a 7 year old very short on the forehead</li>
            <li> Amazingly long shipping time, but</li>
            <li> At the time my hair was too long to have it on.</li>
            <li> and it kept slipping back showing her hair line.</li>
            <li> This arrived about a week earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> did not fit my 7 yrs old dougther.</li>
            <li> Does not fit adult sized head.</li>
            <li> The shipping says it will take a long long time</li>
            <li> It also, took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get (but it was upfront about the expected delivery date), but was still received earlier than promised.</li>
            <li> However, with a few blonde bobby pins to pin those scary bits back, it looked fine.</li>
            <li> I love the thick braid in the back, but the top and sides are really awful.  </li>
            <li> but the sides do not fit well or come down far enough to cover the side hairlines</li>
            <li> I imagine it would be small for an adult.</li>
            <li> Way too small, even for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> Way to small for any adult.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s too small for an adult.</li>
            <li> hair net sent with the wig didn&#x27;t begin to hold her hair and the wig wouldn&#x27;t stay down in front.  </li>
            <li> My only concern was it took a little long to get here</li>
            <li> Wig looks great on picture, but its a horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s look ugly, doesn&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> The braid us in the center and not off to the side like shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The problem is the braid is very loose.  </li>
            <li> Arrived a week before expected.</li>
            <li> While trying to put it on the hair on the front portion of the wig went askew and could not be tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected, but when it arrived, I had to restyle it.</li>
            <li> It is nicer than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> or she will want to wear it everyday, I might post another review after the big night!</li>
            <li> crap didnt fit my 7 year old.</li>
            <li> , I had an event to go to as Elsa the next day and had to pull and tug a tangled K-Mart wig into what I needed, which actually ended up looking better than this stupid thing!</li>
            <li> my fiancee was extremely disappointed because she purchased it for her halloween costume and ended up not being able to use it.</li>
            <li> Than Some Other Wig&#x27;s I&#x27;ve Purchased In The Past!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some other reviews said the bangs were &amp;</li>
            <li> Way to small for a teen!  </li>
            <li> too small.. did not cover the entire head</li>
            <li> I usually wear a small or medium as far as hats go</li>
            <li> This wig was not at all how advertised, it was much too small, like a children&#x27;s wig and it looked atrocious, the front bangs that are supposed to be wind swept backwards either fell all over my face or stuff straight up and looked like Albert Einstein with a braid.</li>
            <li> Hair is coarse and dull and sticks out all over the place.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that it&#x27;s a little small for my head.</li>
            <li> ugly and wouldnt fit a toddler.</li>
            <li> She has dark hair and wanted to be Elsa for halloween.  </li>
            <li> Too big for a kid and too small for a doll... simply a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the shipping took quite a while since it does come from China.  </li>
            <li> Got the job done, but it took FOREVER to arrive and had some bald spots that you could see down to the wig cap.</li>
            <li> I tried to use body tape to keep the widow&#x27;s peak down, but it didn&#x27;t stick to the wig.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse, is the hair is too short on the sides and has fallen out of the braid making it look really rough.</li>
            <li> Probably could have styled it, but not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a little yellower than is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> the fit was horrible for a little kid - way too small for a 6 year old</li>
            <li> No way am I holding onto something of such poor quality.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it was just a waste.</li>
            <li> It did not fit.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Trouble with this staying on</li>
            <li> the hair net it comes with is poor in quality.</li>
            <li> Like the Anna wig what a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s quite heavy.</li>
            <li> Too small, I can&#x27;t hide my black</li>
            <li> this wig is a little hard to get on and to stay down.  </li>
            <li> a little girl...too small</li>
            <li> It would not fit me, and I have a small head.  </li>
            <li> I got it a half month before Halloween, and hardly touched it except to  bobby pin; by Halloween, the braid had fuzzy strands all over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really weird without the swept back bangs and missing hair in front.  </li>
            <li> Very little Is not for asful size</li>
            <li> But once the braid starts to get messy, is really hard to fix it.</li>
            <li> and it turned out to be too small.  </li>
            <li> Way too small.  </li>
            <li> It was so small.</li>
            <li> The cap was too small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even small on my 3 year olds head which is who I bought it for-</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too small.  </li>
            <li> too small for my 7 yr olds head</li>
            <li> The wig is petite or small.</li>
            <li> and this is even too small for me.</li>
            <li> It was way too small</li>
            <li> It is so small  </li>
            <li> small children.&lt;br /&gt;The front will need bobby pins because the hair on the sides keep falling forward.</li>
            <li> SORRY EXCUSE OF A WIG</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in a product before in my whole life.</li>
            <li> I figured it would thin, NOT, FULL haired wig.</li>
            <li> Hard to attach to hair</li>
            <li> Was hard to keep on a childs head - even with tape.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still hard to cover the hairline.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the wig was too heavy for her little head</li>
            <li> My apologies to the seller for this negative review</li>
            <li> The hair was thick and well groomed.</li>
            <li> Amazingly thick.</li>
            <li> Way too small !</li>
            <li> Very small even for a child.</li>
            <li> It is very small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t really durable and will probably be a ratted, nasty mess after a handful of uses.  </li>
            <li> and then there was 3 inches of hair sticking out the back which was impossible to hide.  </li>
            <li> It actually wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> But the quality is not good.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old granddaughter waited anxiously for the arrival and was very disappointed when she put it</li>
            <li> Shipping estimate was a little crazy</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Game three weeks after Halloween ......</li>
            <li> and the hair was rather unhealthy.</li>
            <li> So it is totally useless.  </li>
            <li> Awful, sending back.</li>
            <li> We had a very disappointed little girl even though we ordered it in plenty of time.</li>
            <li> I have a few wigs for cosplay reasons but this was the worst I ever got.</li>
            <li> To small and delivery was terrible not promise as it was said</li>
            <li> but did not arrive in time for Halloween :(</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed</li>
            <li> : (</li>
            <li> /&gt;30 minutes after it arrived at our home it was thrown into the trash by a very frustrated child.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought for my 5 year old and I am having trouble getting it to fit on her head.  the bangs will take some styling.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for the party!</li>
            <li> Awesome wig! Everyone thinks I&#x27;m really Elsa!</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Just as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sparse- there are big holes where your scalp shows. It was cheap and it shows. The braid us in the center and not off to the side like shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 4.  She has dark hair and wanted to be Elsa for halloween.  I bought this for her and it turned out to be too small.  Would not stay on her head. She ended up not wearing a wig for her Elsa costume.  If i had not ordered this wig ( and waited for it to arrive), i would have maybe bought one at a retail store before they all ran out of Elsa wigs.  My daughter was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It came on time, Oct. 30th for Halloween, and it was exactly as described. A bit thin in the back, but great costume wig for the price, and came with a hair cap, so really great deal, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price.  We needed to use some Bobby pins to secure it to my 8 year olds head, but it worked great.</li>
            <li> Fit my 7 year-old passably well and mostly stayed in place for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;Not a very attractive wig.  Hair is coarse and dull and sticks out all over the place.  Probably could have styled it, but not worth the trouble.  Mesh was visible through the hair in some places.  If you have to have an Elsa wig, this will do, but there might be better options out there.</li>
            <li> Soft and flowing, feels like real hair. Looks just like Elsa&#x27;s hair both in color and style. Pieces even fall away toward the face. It did take the maximum delivery time, so don&#x27;t make plans on getting it any earlier. I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The best Elsa wig out there. Great quality and styled perfectly. Everyone kept asking me where I had purchased it for her. We couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a quality wig.  Really loved it.</li>
            <li> Amazingly long shipping time, but really worth the wait...it looks JUST LIKE the photo, fits great and doesn&#x27;t tangle so easily.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture. The crown of the wig is very sparse and wild looking. We call it &amp;#34;The Mullet&amp;#34; fine for a child&#x27;s Halloween costume, (yes, the wig is child size. My 4 year old daughter wore it) I would never use this for an adults costume though, unless maybe if you&#x27;re being Joe Dirt</li>
            <li> This product looked exactly as shown here.  It is very soft.  The problem is the braid is very loose.  I got this for my daughters Halloween costume and she wore it twice.  the braid on top has pretty much fallen completely out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect wig for our God Daughters Elsa Costume!! Best wig purchase to date! Great shipping speed :-)</li>
            <li> Not the best quality and we could not get a good fit</li>
            <li> Way too small.  My 8 year old had to pull it way up on top of her head to cover her front hairline and then there was 3 inches of hair sticking out the back which was impossible to hide.  Good thing it was dark.</li>
            <li> Wig looks great on picture, but its a horrible.</li>
            <li> Not pictured as shown. It was so small. Child size. Did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> Looks good.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.  The quality is better than I expected.  I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my wardrobe</li>
            <li> Hard to attach to hair</li>
            <li> Good for a party, not the best quality but it does the job. Just have to play around to get it like the real elza.</li>
            <li> Looks just like &amp;#34;Elsa&#x27;s&amp;#34; hair.  My daughter wanted all of us to be characters from the movie for Halloween; this was perfect!</li>
            <li> Got the job done, but it took FOREVER to arrive and had some bald spots that you could see down to the wig cap. Not too impressed.</li>
            <li> Amaizing product! I Love it!</li>
            <li> Soft silky hair, but extremely ill fitting. Can&#x27;t get this wig to stay put.</li>
            <li> It was a nice child&#x27;s wig but unless the child is around 2 years old it will not fit comfortably and cover all of the child&#x27;s existing hair.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she loved it, especially when she wears her Elsa dress.</li>
            <li> Very little Is not for asful size</li>
            <li> Our high school students did a princess party as a fundraiser and one of the girls dressed up like Elsa.  This wig looked absolutely adorable on her and the little girls were calling her Elsa.  The wig looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as pretty as pictured, but worked for my 4 year old for Halloween.  I imagine it would be small for an adult.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This wig was not at all how advertised, it was much too small, like a children&#x27;s wig and it looked atrocious, the front bangs that are supposed to be wind swept backwards either fell all over my face or stuff straight up and looked like Albert Einstein with a braid. Not to mention the wig was plainly braided, nothing special about it, not anything like Elsa&#x27;s and was just held together with a piece of string. The only good part about was it came exactly on time, not that it did any good, I had an event to go to as Elsa the next day and had to pull and tug a tangled K-Mart wig into what I needed, which actually ended up looking better than this stupid thing! I am never buying from this seller again and I would very much appreciate my money back!</li>
            <li> Granddaughter must for princess dress up.</li>
            <li> Good product for the money</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, 5, and it didn&#x27;t fit her head completely.  It only came to about 1-2 inches from her front hair line.  I attached it with a lot of bobby pins and combed the from of her hair over the front bobby pinning it to the wig to help it blend.  It looked alright and she felt like Elsa, but it took a lot of pins to get it to stay on.</li>
            <li> I made it looks so professional and so much better than it was when it arrived. My granddaughter still loved it</li>
            <li> This was a better quality than I expected for a child&#x27;s wig.  Good buy and great quality!  Looks like real hair!  My granddaughter will love this!</li>
            <li> This wig is great for the price. It&#x27;s not fantastic or anything, but it was perfect with my costume for my cousins birthday party.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for christmas, she LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;It is made quite well and the style has held up, with a 6 year old throwing it around.&lt;br /&gt;It is made for an adult, so I had to clip the back in order for it to fit on her head.</li>
            <li> Starting to split a little on the top, but I&#x27;ve worn it tons of times now and I just make sure I wear a nude hair cap underneath.  Soft and very pretty as an Elsa wig.</li>
            <li> This item arrived the day AFTER Halloween, so we never truly got to use it as intended. My 7 year old tried it on and didn&#x27;t love it, but I think we&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a wig she DID like wearing. It was big enough for my 12 year old as well. It is just a bit more yellow than blonde and scratchy to the touch.</li>
            <li> This wig didn&#x27;t fit my daughter&#x27;s head, and she has a small head for her age (6). Too big for a kid and too small for a doll... simply a waste of my money. Plus it just isn&#x27;t very good quality.</li>
            <li> ugly and wouldnt fit a toddler.</li>
            <li> Beautifully made wig, but would only fit a child.  Should indicate it&#x27;s a child&#x27;s size wig in the description.</li>
            <li> I had to clip my hair to be able to wear it. At the time my hair was too long to have it on. I can wear it now.</li>
            <li> Very pretty wig, beautiful in fact. I don&#x27;t normally buy wigs, so I&#x27;m no expert.  I got this for my 5 year old daughter to wear for Halloween. Unfortunately, the wig was too heavy for her little head and it kept slipping back showing her hair line. Or maybe I didn&#x27;t fit it on her right.</li>
            <li> Ok I guess not very good quality</li>
            <li> Awesome wig, really really really good color. Came super fast. Also came with a pretty good wig cap. The wig needed some styling and was a little lower quality around the front (the widows peak, sideburns) but other than that, a very goo wig for the price</li>
            <li> Great! The birthday girl was very happy.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d Elsa wig....packaged great. It&#x27;s a gift for a special little girl. Hope she loves it!</li>
            <li> It is just prittey and I like it😊.</li>
            <li> Pretty but did not arrive in time for Halloween :(</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews and buying it anyway, I was very apprehensive when I opened the package. It actually wasn&#x27;t that bad. Granted, when I put it on for the first time, it did, (as another reviewer mentioned) look like a punk rocker. However, with a few blonde bobby pins to pin those scary bits back, it looked fine. Another reviewer said that their wig had bald spots... mine had a full head of hair. I got it a half month before Halloween, and hardly touched it except to  bobby pin; by Halloween, the braid had fuzzy strands all over. I cut most of them off, and it mainly fixed the problem. As most other reviewers say, it was pretty small, for 12 y/o head. I tried to use body tape to keep the widow&#x27;s peak down, but it didn&#x27;t stick to the wig.  Also it&#x27;s a little yellower than is shown in the picture. It&#x27;s very unnatural-looking, but I&#x27;m a brunette, and it would be unnatural anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s all right, and it worked for Halloween trick-or-treating. It wouldn&#x27;t win any contests, but it has it&#x27;s pros and cons.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  The wig doesn&#x27;t completely cover the hair.  I can&#x27;t ship it back to China so I&#x27;m stuck.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit the head of a 4 year old child...a little girl...too small</li>
            <li> Looked kind of raggie on arrival</li>
            <li> A tight fit even for a 7 year old but the braid part is wonderful</li>
            <li> Great Quality and arrived way before that it said.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Way too small, even for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> looks okay but the sides do not fit well or come down far enough to cover the side hairlines, this is on a 7 year old and there is no way for it to fit and cover the roots of her very dark hair.  also it took several weeks to arrive and though there was a tracking number provided it did not provide any information.</li>
            <li> Wig was great, stayed on well and held it&#x27;s shape. The wig made the costume and helped me win third place in a contest.</li>
            <li> Not good at all. It did not stay on my 4 years old daughter&#x27;s head. I should have return it.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old used this for Halloween.  It worked for what we needed and the price was right.  This arrived about a week earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Although is might fit a 22 inch head; it does not fit in depth.  So it is totally useless.  Maybe would fit a child</li>
            <li> Great quality wig for a costume but not really for a 5 year old. Our was too much wig!</li>
            <li> SORRY EXCUSE OF A WIG</li>
            <li> The wig is great, good quality, the front part is a little tricky to style, but it&#x27;s a very good product overall!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it on yet but it looks pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in a product before in my whole life. First of all, it look absolutely nothing like the picture. The hair is not as full, the braid is wimpy, etc. The wig is less a french braid and more a mullet with a braid coming out of it. The fit is VERY weird and the netting shows through the mullet hair on top. I&#x27;m returning it straightaway. No way am I holding onto something of such poor quality.</li>
            <li> the moment i gentle took it out of its package it started to fall apart. my fiancee was extremely disappointed because she purchased it for her halloween costume and ended up not being able to use it. sent it back to amazon for a refund. 5 stars for amazon, 1 star for this topwell elsa wig.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my niece as part of a costume, she loved it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Way Better Than Some Other Wig&#x27;s I&#x27;ve Purchased In The Past!&lt;br /&gt;The Reason Why I Gave It 3 Stars Is Simply Because The Hair Kept Falling Out &amp; The Top Of The Wig I Could See The Cap. Which Means They Should Of Put More Hair On The Top. Overall It Did It&#x27;s Job On Halloween. It Fit Perfect For My 6 YR OLD. She Was Very Happy With It.</li>
            <li> Was hard to keep on a childs head - even with tape. But she loved it!</li>
            <li> Game three weeks after Halloween ...... We had a very disappointed little girl even though we ordered it in plenty of time.</li>
            <li> I love the thick braid in the back, but the top and sides are really awful.  The pieces on the top and side are short so that it barely misses being incorporated into the braid.  Therefore, these short pieces flop around and make it look more like a punk rockers wig rather than an Elsa wig.  Hopefully with some bobby pins and hairspray, I can try to tame those short locks and make it somewhat decent.</li>
            <li> crap didnt fit my 7 year old. The cap was too small</li>
            <li> Wig is well made and fits great</li>
            <li> Great quality, looks just like Elsa&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Good Quality hair...beautiful wig looks just like Elsa from Frozen :)</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Definitely have to do some work on the wig. Doesn&#x27;t lay as nice as the pictures look. Back of wig  is great. Front is just ok.</li>
            <li> Way to small for any adult. Should have been advertised for a child size costume</li>
            <li> I was surprise because we got the Anna wig and LOVED it-I thought same maker (cosplay) and it also came from China, but quality not as great and fit way too small (or I wouldn&#x27;t care about quality as much).  It&#x27;s even small on my 3 year olds head which is who I bought it for-definitely won&#x27;t fit an adult.</li>
            <li> First let me say that the customer service from this seller was good. They responded to my questions in a very prompt manner. But unfortunately, the good review stops there. Now, I realize that I didn&#x27;t pay much for this wig but I really feel like I was duped. The wig resembles the picture from the backside but the front hair line is nothing like the picture. I was very disappointed and so was my 5 year old. What&#x27;s worse, is the hair is too short on the sides and has fallen out of the braid making it look really rough. I tried to &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; it but to no avail. Please don&#x27;t buy this wig. It isn&#x27;t worth it. My apologies to the seller for this negative review but people need to be warned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig along with the adult Elsa costume.  The wig didn&#x27;t indicate if its for adults or children.  My high school/college age employees cannot fit into it - it&#x27;s just too small.  Therefore, it was just a waste.</li>
            <li> It was great. My grandaughter loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s look ugly, doesn&#x27;t fit properly. I try to contact the seller to return but they&#x27;re wasn&#x27;t respond</li>
            <li> Nice wig for children&#x27;s costume.</li>
            <li> Way too small !did not fit my 7 yrs old dougther.</li>
            <li> love it!!!!!  it is perfect...</li>
            <li> Looks great, but fails to stay on.  Hair falls out of braid easily.  Probably won&#x27;t even make it though another costume party after 45 minutes of trick or treat.</li>
            <li> Does not fit adult sized head.</li>
            <li> This wig is too small to completely fit my 7 year old grand-daughter.  There should be some sort of sizing description so one can order appropriately.  It&#x27;s too late to get a replacement that would fit because of the lengthy shipping time.  If I can find something else that will work better, I will return.</li>
            <li> Good wig, just a little small. Should work for my Elsa costume for Halloween.</li>
            <li> The wig was great, other then the fact that it was smaller then expected. I don’t have big head, and it stated it’s a one size fits most adults, so I thought it would fit. I definitely had to do some last minute adjustment to the wig to hide my hair line but all in all it was great.</li>
            <li> Very small even for a child.</li>
            <li> Nice wig but too big for my 6 year old. More for an adult</li>
            <li> seems to be to small for a 7 year old very short on the forehead</li>
            <li> This wig is perfect for my daughter&#x27;s Elsa Halloween costume!  It is good quality for the price and with a little styling will look great!  My only complaint was that the shipping took quite a while since it does come from China.  Make sure you order in plenty of time if you need it!</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a part of an Elsa costume, after reading many reviews about child sized wigs not being large enough for children over 2.  Shipping was free, but took about 4 weeks, as was estimated.  The wig arrived in a good condition, but was still very small, especially considering it is supposed to be adult size.  The hair color however is not the icy white one would expect for Elsa, it is more of a yellowy platinum blond, not what you see in their ad.</li>
            <li> beautiful but slid off the head real easy. still very beautiful</li>
            <li> My daughter (7) received more compliments.  I tried to keep her from being Elsa, since EVERYONE would be, but she insisted &amp; stood out with this awesome wig!</li>
            <li> Best &amp;#34;Elsa&amp;#34; wig out there!  Great quialty at a great price!</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get but overal was great.</li>
            <li> Awful, sending back. Looks nothing like picture...more like a mullet with a braid. Keep in mind this is supposedly for an adult,  and it fits my 4 yr old.</li>
            <li> My 4 YO thought it was the best wig ever, for her &amp;#34;Elsa&amp;#34; costume. She wore it all night for halloween. But once the braid starts to get messy, is really hard to fix it. The front doesn&#x27;t quite look like that. You&#x27;d have to style it. Also, the sides are higher than what the picture shows, so if you&#x27;re going to use this for a grownup, you&#x27;d have to fix it so it covers your sideburns ..</li>
            <li> The item arrived in a timely matter. The quality of hair is great. The only problem I had was that it&#x27;s a little small for my head. I&#x27;m hoping it will stretch out with wearing it a couple times.</li>
            <li> It did not fit. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This arrived in a timely fashion and was perfect!  Earlier reviews said it might need styling on arrival, but this was not the case with the one I received.  I ordered this for my 7 year old niece and it was a good fit.  This was a replacement for a wig purchased at a costume store that was not a good fit.  The interior of the wig is adjustable, so I feel she will get a lot of use from the wig.  It is a very good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Wig was beautiful. Fit great. Shipping estimate was a little crazy</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Arrived a week before expected.</li>
            <li> Wig was awesome and really life like like Elsa. Got lots of compliments. Liked the wig net that came with it too to hold my daughters hair back.</li>
            <li> Does not stay on head very well.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it completed her costume prefectly.</li>
            <li> too small for my 7 yr olds head</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t keep on a 8 year old head</li>
            <li> Not enough hair. The fabric cloth was showing through the hair in some spots.</li>
            <li> just as described. perfect for kids dress up playtime.</li>
            <li> The wig is petite or small. Did not fit a 18 year old head with short hair</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our 7.5 yr old daughter, as an &amp;#34;Elsa wig&amp;#34; was the ONLY thing she asked for this Christmas!  We did a lot of research, and found many reviews of other wigs stated over and over they were too small for even a 5 year old to wear.  The reviews for this wig were pretty good, and the price very reasonable.  I have to say, the quality of this wig is better than I could have imagined!  Our daughter loves it, and it looks incredible in photos!  Some other reviews said the bangs were &amp;#34;a mess&amp;#34;, but we have not had that experience at all.  After some practice, our daughter is even able to put the wig on by herself with none of her own hair showing.  Just know you need to adjust the size using the hooks in the back of the wig cap- very easy to do.  Excellent product!!!!</li>
            <li> I got these for 5 and 6 year old girls Halloween costumes. They both went as Elsa. The wig is satisfactory. It is very small. Barely fit my 6 soon to be 7 year old. But we got it to work. These are NOT for adults! They don&#x27;t look as nice as the picture but they look decent. The shipping says it will take a long long time but we got them in about a week. We used the wig cap and pined them to their heads and they stayed on nicely for trick or treating. The girls got a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Too small, I can&#x27;t hide my black hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE TO BUY BIG WIG, BECAUSE I BOUGHT ELSA CUSTUME.</li>
            <li> The wig was absolutely wonderful. The hair was thick and well groomed. Amazingly thick. I figured it would thin, NOT, FULL haired wig. would fit adult to child. adjust inside mat. so sliding on the head. I bought this for my niece to complete her frozen costume.  she loved it...great...I was amazed...thanks amazon and cosplay...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be used for a Halloween costume and it looks great.  Love the quality.  I ordered it adult size because my Granddaughter wears the same size of hat that I do.  This wig is going to work great.</li>
            <li> Very nice my daughter looked just like Elsa very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that this was for my child, as it would never fit an adult.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get (but it was upfront about the expected delivery date), but was still received earlier than promised. The wig is VERY similar to Princess Elsa&#x27;s hair in the movie. It is a little big for my 9 year old daughter, but she loves it!</li>
            <li> Yes! Thank you! It is wonderful. My only concern was it took a little long to get here and I was nervous it wouldn&#x27;t arrive by Halloween. It&#x27;s here and we are happy!</li>
            <li> Picture showed a grown woman wearing it and it barely fit my six year old. Arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Really needs work to look that good.</li>
            <li> Took over a month to get And doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit. My daughter is 7 and couldn&#x27;t even for her head!</li>
            <li> This wig is very well made and was a great value. My daughter wore this for Halloween. It stayed in her head all night and looked amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> The hairs at the top of the wig are out of place, it&#x27;s too small to fit my 4-year-old&#x27;s head, and it smells so badly of chemicals I wouldn&#x27;t put it on her head even if it fit for fear of the off gas.</li>
            <li> Trouble with this staying on</li>
            <li> My 6 year old granddaughter waited anxiously for the arrival and was very disappointed when she put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair net sent with the wig didn&#x27;t begin to hold her hair and the wig wouldn&#x27;t stay down in front.  While trying to put it on the hair on the front portion of the wig went askew and could not be tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 minutes after it arrived at our home it was thrown into the trash by a very frustrated child.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> Its way too small for a 3 yrs old!!!</li>
            <li> the wig is very nice but does need some styling. the hair net it comes with is poor in quality. otherwise great product!</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast and it looks wonderful! The bangs need major styling though as to be expected since it was in a bag.</li>
            <li> I have a few wigs for cosplay reasons but this was the worst I ever got. You would need to cut and style the wigs bangs yourself so it&#x27;s not even as shown. Also it&#x27;s too small for an adult. I usually wear a small or medium as far as hats go and this is even too small for me. The braid had hair sticking out everywhere and the hair was rather unhealthy. I&#x27;ll be sticking to X&amp;Y from now on.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this wig, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would get here in time, seeing as it was being shipped from China, so I ordered a back-up.  I now have 2 Elsa wigs to choose from.</li>
            <li> the front of the wig looks nothing like the pictures. its a bit more messy but the braid looks good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real enough. captures Elsa wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This wig looks like a mullet. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone! I was very disappointed when I got it. You definitely get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Terrible.  Way to small for a teen!  The hairline doesn&#x27;t come forward enough.  Don&#x27;t buy this wig.  You will be disappointed</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected, but when it arrived, I had to restyle it. A lot. Some pieces of hair keep falling out, but for a $20 dollar wig, it will do for Halloween. Doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture.</li>
            <li> This fits my 3 &amp; 1/2 year old perfectly.  It would not fit me, and I have a small head.  It is nicer than I expected for the price.  She loves it.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Needed a little styling but otherwise looked great straight from the box. Very happy with this wig and my 6 year old daughter is thrilled with it!!!!</li>
            <li> Like the Anna wig what a waste of money.  It was way too small</li>
            <li> Does not stay on your head too well. And it&#x27;s quite heavy.</li>
            <li> too small.. did not cover the entire head</li>
            <li> To small and delivery was terrible not promise as it was said</li>
            <li> granddaughter played with forever.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> The size It&#x27;s perfect for my daughter, she is 7 years olds. But the quality is not good.</li>
            <li> I got the wig today and it came weeks before the estimated date of delivery which makes me happy. The fit of the wig is quite small and I am going to have to work with styling it just right to get it to fit my sister&#x27;s adult head properly. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair on the top, the coverage is thin and the wig cap underneath does show through...again I am going to have to really work the styling to make it look good. The braid itself though is thick and full and the hair is tightly bound with no stray hairs. It came with a hair net too which is a positive. Overall for a costume it will be fine since my sister isn&#x27;t as particular as I am. For a Con cosplay though I would not recommend this wig. It isn&#x27;t quite up to cosplay standards in my opinion. It was inexpensive though and had free shipping so I don&#x27;t mind the drawbacks. If you have a large adult head don&#x27;t buy this wig.</li>
            <li> This is a wig made for a child. It is so small  doesn&#x27;t fit a normal size head, picture is much better than actual product</li>
            <li> The wig is nice, I was impressed with the quality.  The only problem is the top does not come down over the hairline.  I don&#x27;t know if I am not doing something right, but I am not sure she will be able to wear it.  It is basically the way it is manufactured I suppose.  I was happy with the price, and the appearance of the hair. It does not come styled on top and so when I try to lift sections to make it curve like the picture, it pulls the braiding loose and is not easy to get it to look right. I will have to work with that a while.  It also, took a long time to arrive. That is why I give it a 4 star. m Overall, I like it.</li>
            <li> What I received is not what was pictured.  It won&#x27;t even fit on a head.  It&#x27;s really weird without the swept back bangs and missing hair in front.  Beware!  Unfortunately, I do not know where to find a good Elsa wig.  : (</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Seller was easy to deal with. Product was as described... Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Not anything like the photo. The purchase was for my 6 year old. It is too big even on the smallest setting, so not for small children.&lt;br /&gt;The front will need bobby pins because the hair on the sides keep falling forward.</li>
            <li> Thin, especially across the front but as a 9 year old&#x27;s Halloween wig it works just fine.  The adjustable sizing strap is awesome and provides for a pretty good range of head sizes from large to average to small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t really durable and will probably be a ratted, nasty mess after a handful of uses.  If you want that, though, you&#x27;ll probably have to spend more than $20 for a wig.</li>
            <li> The wig was OK. Worked great for my daughter Halloween Costume and for play. The adjustable band was a big plus</li>
            <li> Silky and Beautiful! All ready shaped and braided, came in when the seller said it would!  It looks like it will fit my 6 year old for Halloween, but I am trying to keep it away from her until then or she will want to wear it everyday, I might post another review after the big night!</li>
            <li> the fit was horrible for a little kid - way too small for a 6 year old</li>
            <li> this wig is a little hard to get on and to stay down.  I have to use many bobby pins to keep it in place and it&#x27;s still hard to cover the hairline.</li>
            <li> The wig is adjustable but came in just an envelope so it was all smashed and has to be brought back to life.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as the picture.  Seams can be seen and hair falls out easily.  Granted - we do not have a lot of experience with wigs, so maybe this is a normal thing…  I would doubt that however.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was not a disney product.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughter!</li>
            <li> Good for the Price&lt;br /&gt;perfect for Halloween costume or a play&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t look real of curse but do the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;those pictures are from Halloween 2014 and I didn&#x27;t have time to&lt;br /&gt;find and buy the original Elsa Dress so I use an Egyptian one lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well hope my review helps you decide.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy, but looks awesome!</li>
