            <li>This is a great cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted an alternative to the salycilic acid products I use and thought the Glycolic acid in this would be good.</li>
            <li>and I have nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
            <li>I have always been good at washing my face, my skin is on the fair side</li>
            <li>I have fair Caucasian combination skin that is acne prone.  </li>
            <li>Good luck in your search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  normally write review but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and bright.  </li>
            <li>Been using since my Dermatologist recommended it more than 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>It has made the rest of my complexion noticeably clearer and more even.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I looked and tried many</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite cleanser.  </li>
            <li>and I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am glad I  did.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Prior to this, Clarisonic and Acne.org were my best combo but even still, I always had 5-8 zits just sitting there, mocking me.</li>
            <li>- my skin is glowy and much more even.</li>
            <li>and I have found washing it off with a bit of baking soda to provide a nice exfoliation and fizzle, giving you that clean feeling</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s very gentle, so perfect for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if I have any issues with the product, but so far it&#x27;s been a great choice.</li>
            <li>Very mild but does the job.</li>
            <li>This product has made a huge difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>This product has made a huge difference in my acne.</li>
            <li>And my legs never felt so smooth when I use it to shave.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for the bumps in the underarm area</li>
            <li>When I recieved my first bottle the lid had come off and most of it had spilled out.</li>
            <li>This in turn allows for your own body to build new collagen and maintain a fresher skin.  </li>
            <li>allows skin to feel clean and not too drying for me.</li>
            <li>and then I will use this to clean off the rest of the dirt and makeup.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin feel extremely clean.  </li>
            <li>I will try it for a month or so more to see if I notice any positive results</li>
            <li>I gave it 4stars because I&#x27;m still waiting for the full results</li>
            <li>I have struggled with sebaceous cysts for some time now, and I found many recommendations online to use Aqua Glycolic (particularly the glycolic acid in it) cleanser to prevent the cysts and the toner to treat them.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product to me while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, I have had a significant improvement in my skin, and have been able to cut back on oral medications significantly.  </li>
            <li>laugh and smile lines have faded substantially.</li>
            <li>is my routine, for what it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt really feel clean after I use it.oily type feeling after.</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because even though gycolic acid is supposed to help with bumps this product doesnt claim to help so I will try kp duty instead and enjoy my clear skin!</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers have noted, the consistently is very light, so it might not feel like you are getting a deep clean.</li>
            <li>I use a makeup remover first</li>
            <li>I saw results within days of my first use.</li>
            <li>will add that at the same time that I started using this, I also have been using the facial cream from the same line (excellent!)</li>
            <li>Not sure if I actually ordered the cleanser when I wanted the lotion, which is totally GREAT!  </li>
            <li>good cleanser, seems to help take off dead skin just like a exfoliator cream.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, however it seems as though my skin has an issue of refusing to shed does skin, so this daily mini peel for face wash is amazing.</li>
            <li>At first, I started to breakout more as some other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>I swear this is my first product review, but I feel so strongly about this product I wanted to share with new potential buyers.</li>
            <li>I tried it it really didnt work</li>
            <li>I am very tolerant of it</li>
            <li>this has really brightened my face and has already rid on some of my acne scars.</li>
            <li>This wash has really helped me stop breaking out, and it has noticeable evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I ran out of it really fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but, does the job.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the whole system - just the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works very well to prevent break outs combined with toner.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is really gentle.</li>
            <li>Ordering it off Amazon is so much easier &amp; maybe</li>
            <li>but when I stand next to some 19 year old, their skin has this dewy magic to it that I just can&#x27;t replicate.</li>
            <li>Im already back on today just three days later to order more, plus I ordered some 20% glycolic pads because</li>
            <li>It is light, effective and not too expensive.  </li>
            <li>I would also highly recommend the body wash if you deal with breakouts on your body.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear from blemishes while being gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole aqua glycolic line (cleanser, toner, moisturizer, and body wash) in an attempt to clear up my breakouts.</li>
            <li>As I would anything new you are going to put on your face.</li>
            <li>I, however, feel like it is probably better for your skin not to irritate it with a harsh cleanser!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what has been the magic ingredient in all this</li>
            <li>After, I pat dry, apply Clinique Benzoyl Peroxide to any existing blemishes,  and use a light moisturizer (&amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; Daily Moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing about 50% less makeup than I was before and looking much better than I did prior to this</li>
            <li>jaw, forehead, large pores, breakouts constantly.</li>
            <li>Two weeks after using this, my skin is CLEAR.</li>
            <li>And not just clear of zits</li>
            <li>i think this product keeps your skin looking young.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommends it because it is so gentle, though I have left it on for about 30 minutes like a mask.</li>
            <li>I have mature skin</li>
            <li>I am a 52 year old acne sufferer who has had problem skin since the age of 10.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the whole line for about a month and my skin is really starting to change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young, so diminishing the appearance of wrinkles wasn&#x27;t my goal</li>
            <li>I have battle hormonal and cystic acne since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I wear make up daily, out of necessity, on a whim I decided to try the whole line.</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and have some sun spots.</li>
            <li>Not saying it will work for you, but after my struggle, I try to post as much info as I can to help others with the same issues.  </li>
            <li>I use the body lotion as a facial lotion because it has higher AHA concentration than the facial lotion.</li>
            <li>Helped with adult acne breakouts, has virtually no smell and does not leave your skin dry like so many other facial cleansers for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the other reviews are right that you have to be patient and give this cleanser time.</li>
            <li>(no more antibiotics or birth control, I still take spironolactone which is a fantastic anti-androgen medication).</li>
            <li>I am one of the poor saps probably like many of you reading this, that suffered through adult acne for a number of years.  </li>
            <li>I think I stumbled across this in my countless hours of reading Amazon reviews, trying in vain to find a product that would clear my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use it once in the evening so far and finish it off by using the aqua glycolic moisterizer.</li>
            <li>So far, having used it for a few months, it&#x27;s worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Yes your skin is going to get worse before it gets better, so be prepared.</li>
            <li>I usually use a facial wipe to clean off my make-up</li>
            <li>am a 24 year old, white female with stress breakouts around my chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I believe the old adage is true: It will get worse before it gets</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and acne prone, so I need to be careful about finding a cleanser that will not irritate my skin.</li>

            <li> My skin is very sensitive and acne prone, so I need to be careful about finding a cleanser that will not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I follow with a moisturizer (raw shea butter) and my face is ready for the night.</li>
            <li> It will not transform you or take &amp;#34;years off your natural age&amp;#34;, but it will allow you to look a little fresher and I believe to have a healthier skin just by a regular maintenance of exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser bottle itself has a pumping apparatus in it, and the instructions are clearly printed on the bottle, so I haven&#x27;t had any trouble using it.  </li>
            <li> slowly and gently exfoliate your face and body over a period of time (no fast-fixes here people) and allow your body with the lotion&#x27;s assistance to maintain that exfoliation process.  </li>
            <li> A little hidden secret to most.</li>
            <li> YOU APPLY THIS TO DRY SKIN, so while the shower heats up, I rub two pumps into face, neck and chest areas.  </li>
            <li> I pat dry, apply the BP if needed, and Ceravue nighttime</li>
            <li> think you COULD use this with a Clarisonic, but you would probably have to apply the product to dry skin, then dampen your Clairsonic brush head to massage in.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the gycolic content is just not strong enough or what, but using this is similar to using Cetaphil or nothing at all.</li>
            <li> anyone has a suggestion for what actually works for stress breakouts (other than quitting my crappy job!)</li>
            <li> I read about it in a magazine, and was skeptical at first, but this is definitely one product that works.  </li>
            <li> and while I still have some breakouts they are much smaller and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something stronger that would help clear my skin since I&#x27;ve been breaking out lately.</li>
            <li> My skin has been worse in my 20s than it was in high</li>
            <li> I like the other products by  Aqua Glycolic also.  </li>
            <li> I apply it on dry skin, rub a little bit then leave it for 5 minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> My acne was bad and most other acne facewashes are not safe for pregnancy.</li>
            <li> My skin is breaking out much less</li>
            <li> After about 6 weeks, My skin is clearer an scars are fading, I am using less make up.</li>
            <li> All I know is that by sticking to a regimen that includes this cleanser, my skin gradually calmed down and I only get a few random pimples each month due to hormones/</li>
            <li> some say they were missing.</li>
            <li> Everything the derm has ever given me aside from retin A has broken me out hives and left me with scares.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed wrinkles and uneven areas of my skin improving.</li>
            <li> I used it once a day before bed for a few days before going to twice a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for a few minutes in the shower while I wash my body.  </li>
            <li> and have been using a toner of apple cider vinegar and green tea (1/3 vinegar, 2/3 tea).</li>
            <li> Just started using a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It usually ships quickly no matter where it comes from.  </li>
            <li> All those little surface cancers can be slowly wittled away through maintenance and then put on the sun screen and definately see your dermatologist once a year.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m too afraid to stop any of them for fear that the zits will come back.</li>
            <li> It is a common sense product with no glitzy or bling-bling</li>
            <li> At 33, I&#x27;m a little sick of fighting zits and wrinkles at the same time.</li>
            <li> Depends what you mean by that.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall, and the only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars, is because it doesn&#x27;t help with my stress/hormone breakouts...which are unfortunately the very worst part of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, when it arrived, I had to wait in line to get it from behind the counter.</li>
            <li> I have had terrible hormonal acne since going off birth control last july.</li>
            <li> One ophthalmologist told me he thought he had come into the wrong patient&#x27;s exam room because my chart said I was 50</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very bad hormonal and stress acne that I&#x27;ve been fighting since puberty and some things have improved it but never cleared it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I originally bought this for the bumps in the underarm area I tried it it really didnt work I think my problem needs something stonger. However I also suffer from aldult acne, well I did, my skin has never looked so beautiful. And my legs never felt so smooth when I use it to shave. I gave it 5 stars because even though gycolic acid is supposed to help with bumps this product doesnt claim to help so I will try kp duty instead and enjoy my clear skin!</li>
            <li> I swear this is my first product review, but I feel so strongly about this product I wanted to share with new potential buyers. I have had terrible hormonal acne since going off birth control last july. cystic acne on my neck, jaw, forehead, large pores, breakouts constantly. I have had acne since my teens, so I am a product junkie. received this product in the mail on Saturday. started to use sunday night and it has totally cleared up my face, improved my tone and texture. I am very tolerant of it so ive been using it several times a day and I have found washing it off with a bit of baking soda to provide a nice exfoliation and fizzle, giving you that clean feeling some say they were missing. Im already back on today just three days later to order more, plus I ordered some 20% glycolic pads because im convinced glycolic acid is the answer! finally! we are all different, but I would def try this product!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something stronger that would help clear my skin since I&#x27;ve been breaking out lately. I wanted an alternative to the salycilic acid products I use and thought the Glycolic acid in this would be good. I don&#x27;t know if the gycolic content is just not strong enough or what, but using this is similar to using Cetaphil or nothing at all. This is not doing it for me.</li>
            <li> I use this product every evening after washing my face with cetaphyl. I apply it on dry skin, rub a little bit then leave it for 5 minutes before rinsing. I follow with a moisturizer (raw shea butter) and my face is ready for the night. My complexion looks great.</li>
            <li> this has really brightened my face and has already rid on some of my acne scars. love it! will purchase again</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now. Yes it cleared my skin. Yes your skin is going to get worse before it gets better, so be prepared. I gave it 4stars because I&#x27;m still waiting for the full results</li>
            <li> i think this product keeps your skin looking young.  i use it in the moring after i am done shaving , etc.  it keeps the oil off your skin too</li>
            <li> This wash has really helped me stop breaking out, and it has noticeable evened out my skin tone. LOVE it! And, it&#x27;s very gentle, so perfect for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> good cleanser, seems to help take off dead skin just like a exfoliator cream.  allows skin to feel clean and not too drying for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything! Everything the derm has ever given me aside from retin A has broken me out hives and left me with scares. I have very sensitive skin, however it seems as though my skin has an issue of refusing to shed does skin, so this daily mini peel for face wash is amazing. Only one I&#x27;ll use and I&#x27;ve tried EVERY product there is including 100 dollar bottles of fancy moisturizer and serum. GODSEND</li>
            <li> Been using since my Dermatologist recommended it more than 10 years ago. A little hidden secret to most. Awesome product for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for 5+ years and I have nothing but good things to say about it. My dermatologist recommends it because it is so gentle, though I have left it on for about 30 minutes like a mask. I use a makeup remover first and then this works to cleanse my face. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser. I ran out of it really fast. It&#x27;s gentle but, does the job. If you have a dermatologist, I would run it by them before trying. As I would anything new you are going to put on your face.</li>
            <li> Terrific skin care product.  My skin has improved using this product. I have been using it for several months now.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear from blemishes while being gentle on the skin. Recommended by my dermatologist and she said she uses it daily, too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the whole system - just the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 24 year old, white female with stress breakouts around my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this feeling hopeless. My skin has been worse in my 20s than it was in high school.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is no miracle, but it has become a mainstay of my face wash regime. It has made the rest of my complexion noticeably clearer and more even. The only downfall, and the only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars, is because it doesn&#x27;t help with my stress/hormone breakouts...which are unfortunately the very worst part of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has a suggestion for what actually works for stress breakouts (other than quitting my crappy job!), I am open to suggestions.</li>
            <li> Works very well to prevent break outs combined with toner. Recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is really gentle. My skin is very sensitive and acne prone, so I need to be careful about finding a cleanser that will not irritate my skin. Like many of the other reviewers have noted, the consistently is very light, so it might not feel like you are getting a deep clean. I, however, feel like it is probably better for your skin not to irritate it with a harsh cleanser! I usually use a facial wipe to clean off my make-up and then I will use this to clean off the rest of the dirt and makeup.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I love it. When I recieved my first bottle the lid had come off and most of it had spilled out. I emailed the company and they sent me another bottle. I would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I looked and tried many but this is my favorite cleanser.  It is light, effective and not too expensive.  It usually ships quickly no matter where it comes from.  I like the other products by  Aqua Glycolic also.  I use the body lotion as a facial lotion because it has higher AHA concentration than the facial lotion. I have mature skin and I need the 8-10 %. I would recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with sebaceous cysts for some time now, and I found many recommendations online to use Aqua Glycolic (particularly the glycolic acid in it) cleanser to prevent the cysts and the toner to treat them.  So far, having used it for a few months, it&#x27;s worked pretty well.  The cleanser bottle itself has a pumping apparatus in it, and the instructions are clearly printed on the bottle, so I haven&#x27;t had any trouble using it.  I&#x27;ll update this review if I have any issues with the product, but so far it&#x27;s been a great choice.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel extremely clean.  I only use it once in the evening so far and finish it off by using the aqua glycolic moisterizer.</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference in my complexion.  My skin is smooth and bright.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 6 months and I am so pleased with the results. I&#x27;m to the point where I can just put some sunscreen and BB cream on my face and that is all I need.  The cleanser is creamy and I have not noticed any discernible fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I read about it in a magazine, and was skeptical at first, but this is definitely one product that works.  I use it once a day, although you can use it twice a day.  You must use a sunscreen, as after using the product - as indicated on the product label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same company also makes a product for the body as well, although i haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference in my acne. I am a 52 year old acne sufferer who has had problem skin since the age of 10. sigh. Since using this product, I have had a significant improvement in my skin, and have been able to cut back on oral medications significantly.  (no more antibiotics or birth control, I still take spironolactone which is a fantastic anti-androgen medication). I love, love, love this cleanser. I would recommend it for anyone, regardless of age or skin type.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole aqua glycolic line (cleanser, toner, moisturizer, and body wash) in an attempt to clear up my breakouts. At first, I started to breakout more as some other reviewers have said. I decided to continue use and hope thing would improve. I&#x27;ve been using the whole line for about a month and my skin is really starting to change. My skin is breaking out much less and while I still have some breakouts they are much smaller and less noticeable. I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are clearing out as well. I think the other reviews are right that you have to be patient and give this cleanser time. And I believe the old adage is true: It will get worse before it gets better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed wrinkles and uneven areas of my skin improving. I&#x27;m young, so diminishing the appearance of wrinkles wasn&#x27;t my goal but I have noticed laugh and smile lines have faded substantially. I&#x27;m actually pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend easing into this product line. I used it once a day before bed for a few days before going to twice a day. Also, I used the moisturizer at night only. It&#x27;s a bit heavy. I would also highly recommend the body wash if you deal with breakouts on your body. I saw results within days of my first use.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this, and for a couple years I ordered it from the Publix pharmacy. That was a hassle because they never kept it in stock, so I had to wait for it. Also, when it arrived, I had to wait in line to get it from behind the counter. Ordering it off Amazon is so much easier &amp; maybe even cheaper. People tell me almost daily that I look about 15 yrs. younger than my age. One ophthalmologist told me he thought he had come into the wrong patient&#x27;s exam room because my chart said I was 50 but I looked 35.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  normally write review but this stuff is great! I have battle hormonal and cystic acne since my early 20&#x27;s. Now I n my early 30&#x27;s I had almost given up. I have been to derms before and I have taken antibiotics and even fiddle with going o n acutane. I have always been good at washing my face, my skin is on the fair side and I had acne scars. I wear make up daily, out of necessity, on a whim I decided to try the whole line. Boy! I am glad I  did. After about 6 weeks, My skin is clearer an scars are fading, I am using less make up. I have even received compliments from family, friends and coworkers. Give it v a try!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. I am 54 years old and have some sun spots. I love this product. It works so well for me. I use it along with the face cream.</li>
            <li> I have fair Caucasian combination skin that is acne prone.  I am one of the poor saps probably like many of you reading this, that suffered through adult acne for a number of years.  I can&#x27;t even remember what turned me on to this product initially.  I think I stumbled across this in my countless hours of reading Amazon reviews, trying in vain to find a product that would clear my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use this product in conjunction with two others - Dr. Peter Thomas Roth BHA cleanser and a Clarisonic Mia, so I cannot comment on this alone clearing your skin.  All I know is that by sticking to a regimen that includes this cleanser, my skin gradually calmed down and I only get a few random pimples each month due to hormones/my cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my routine, for what it&#x27;s worth.  Not saying it will work for you, but after my struggle, I try to post as much info as I can to help others with the same issues.  Good luck in your search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this only once/day - in the morning.  YOU APPLY THIS TO DRY SKIN, so while the shower heats up, I rub two pumps into face, neck and chest areas.  I leave it on for a few minutes in the shower while I wash my body.  After, I pat dry, apply Clinique Benzoyl Peroxide to any existing blemishes,  and use a light moisturizer (&amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; Daily Moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night, I use a wipe to remove makeup, then use Dr. Peter Thomas Roth BHA cleanser with my Clarisonic Mia.  I pat dry, apply the BP if needed, and Ceravue nighttime moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you COULD use this with a Clarisonic, but you would probably have to apply the product to dry skin, then dampen your Clairsonic brush head to massage in.  Then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can last awhile, too.  I use about 2 pumps/day.  I bought the 2-pack in February 2013 and didn&#x27;t have to replace it until December.</li>
            <li> At 33, I&#x27;m a little sick of fighting zits and wrinkles at the same time. I&#x27;ve had very bad hormonal and stress acne that I&#x27;ve been fighting since puberty and some things have improved it but never cleared it. I&#x27;ve tried Proactive, Acne.Org, prescription retinol, clarisonic - you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. Prior to this, Clarisonic and Acne.org were my best combo but even still, I always had 5-8 zits just sitting there, mocking me. Two weeks after using this, my skin is CLEAR. And not just clear of zits - my skin is glowy and much more even. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles but when I stand next to some 19 year old, their skin has this dewy magic to it that I just can&#x27;t replicate. Well, til now, that is. I&#x27;m wearing about 50% less makeup than I was before and looking much better than I did prior to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that at the same time that I started using this, I also have been using the facial cream from the same line (excellent!) and have been using a toner of apple cider vinegar and green tea (1/3 vinegar, 2/3 tea). I&#x27;m not sure what has been the magic ingredient in all this but I&#x27;m too afraid to stop any of them for fear that the zits will come back. For the time being, I won&#x27;t be adding or subtracting anything to my daily ritual.</li>
            <li> Just started using a few weeks ago. Doesnt really feel clean after I use it.oily type feeling after. I will try it for a month or so more to see if I notice any positive results</li>
            <li> Helped with adult acne breakouts, has virtually no smell and does not leave your skin dry like so many other facial cleansers for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a tea tree toner afterwords. Rosewater does work well also&lt;br /&gt;then follow with Ferulic Acid or Hyaluric Acid and Argan Oil</li>
            <li> Have been using this forever and it is wonderful.  Very mild but does the job.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I actually ordered the cleanser when I wanted the lotion, which is totally GREAT!  Have been using the lotion for years.  It is not a glitzy product for women - or men for that matter - that need the fancy packaging and the insincere sales lady that will bolster you ego with mysterious ingredients and high-priced products.  Noooooo!  It is a pharmaceutically prepared lotion with well-known ingredients that do what they are asked to do:  slowly and gently exfoliate your face and body over a period of time (no fast-fixes here people) and allow your body with the lotion&#x27;s assistance to maintain that exfoliation process.  This in turn allows for your own body to build new collagen and maintain a fresher skin.  Yep - it does that.  Will it make you look younger?  Depends what you mean by that.  It will not transform you or take &amp;#34;years off your natural age&amp;#34;, but it will allow you to look a little fresher and I believe to have a healthier skin just by a regular maintenance of exfoliation.  All those little surface cancers can be slowly wittled away through maintenance and then put on the sun screen and definately see your dermatologist once a year.  It is a common sense product with no glitzy or bling-bling advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I don&#x27;t use cleansers.  Just a simple non-drying soap of varying brands.  Has been working for me.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me while I was pregnant. My acne was bad and most other acne facewashes are not safe for pregnancy. This product helped alot.</li>
