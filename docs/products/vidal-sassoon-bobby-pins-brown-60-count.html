            <li>This causes most bobby pins to slip out.</li>
            <li>My child needed more bobby pins.</li>
            <li>Much better than the sollar store ones.</li>
            <li>The top and the bottom of the bobby pin don&#x27;t meet.  </li>

            <li>Will order more from this seller.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find them.</li>
            <li>So, needed to purchase more.</li>
            <li>but thats what i wanted :)</li>
            <li>hair is very fine and smooth.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and fresh, which is important since these will be stocking stuffers for my girls. :)</li>
            <li>Not the Walmart specials that bend so easily.  </li>
            <li>They warp easily.</li>
            <li>These are the strong type of bobby pins that don&#x27;t bend easily.</li>
            <li>Good price and a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically dark brown with those lighter brown highlights- perfect color, price and quantity.</li>
            <li>The brown fits in with my light</li>
            <li>and they fit</li>
            <li>They are not the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>Great value for this big lot of bobby pins, well coated.</li>
            <li>The ladies in my family all have light colored hair so these are what we need.</li>
            <li>these are good bobby pins so far.</li>
            <li>Pretty bobby pins and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon did it right!  </li>
            <li>They stay in place just fine, assuming I put them in right.</li>
            <li>but these are holding up great without slipping out or tearing up my hair.</li>
            <li>Works very good with my thick hair.</li>
            <li>This is worth buying.  </li>
            <li>if you know any non-black closed pins that have a good grip..</li>
            <li>Worth buying.  </li>
            <li>These were the right color and plenty of them.</li>
            <li>These are great bobby pins and a great color as it would work with dark blonde to dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure why losing bobby pins is such an epidemic</li>
            <li>These are REAL Bobby Pins!</li>
            <li>For pin curls, they are ok if there is enough hair in each curl.  </li>
            <li>So thanks for carrying this product!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture, 60 brown pinched-closed bobby pins.</li>
            <li>If you need bobby pins, that are brown, and they are the closed kind, then these are for you.</li>
            <li>Plus, the package comes with a lot of &#x27;em, which is great since I seem to lose them pretty easily, meaning I take them out and put them in weird places.</li>
            <li>I have very long and very fine hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are metal bobby pins, one side is straight, one side is wavy.</li>
            <li>Not that it matters that much, but these were a bit discolored.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than in the store.  </li>
            <li>These pins are very well built,  they do the job of holding my hair in place</li>
            <li>blondes.they are better than other brands cuse</li>
            <li>but they were even sliding from on top of each other.</li>
            <li>Good color that can work on dark blonde to med.</li>
            <li>hair color is between brown and blonde so these match perfectly and with proper styling they&#x27;re hard to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent quality.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these based on their price, quality, and amount.  </li>
            <li>High quality bobby pins.</li>
            <li>They seem to be a high quality pin.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth sending back for the price, but I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li>These bobby pins are simple and exactly what</li>
            <li>These are pretty standard bobby pins.  </li>
            <li>Like every other person in the universe, I have bought over 3000 bobby pins in my life, but have 5 left :)  ....</li>
            <li>But when i put them above the neck in back to hold in shorter hairs under a pony tail, they fell out pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>For fine hair, at least, they are also very slippery and did not work well for me, using them for hair styling.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who needs bobby pins like old person like me will like it.</li>
            <li>Not like the old Bobbi pins.</li>
            <li>Save your money, go to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and buy their brand of professional bobby pins (can find on sale 300 for $6).</li>
            <li>Just what I needed, color and soft tips.</li>
            <li>The first time I put them, as soon as I walked out of the bathroom I felt they were already getting loose and</li>
            <li>They are very weak and if you are lucky enough to get one to stay in your hair without bending completely out of shape, then it will for sure be unusable for a second time!</li>
            <li>i love how thick the little ball part is on the ends (women will know how sometimes that part comes off and that can hurt) pretty sturdy so far.</li>
            <li>Very soft dosent hold the hair properly..</li>
            <li>There are no other brands, in my opinion that can compare to Vidal Sassoon Bobby Pins.</li>
            <li>These are hard to find in the store so i ordered them here.good for light hair brown and</li>
            <li>hair is just a weird, in-between shade on its own; but if you happen to have light-medium brown hair with highlights this blends well with the combination of tones.</li>
            <li>These are not really tight enough.</li>
            <li>I learned some people may sell it as a bobby pin but it is just a cheap piece of wire that could not hold hair other than maybe a baby&#x27;s, wasted money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used much crappier bobby pins, and I have used bobby pins a little nicer, but these get the job done in an acceptable manner.  </li>

            <li> I thought bobby pins were the same, but apparently not.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward for pins that have tight support and after the previous reviews decided to give them a try..</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with bobby pins for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> They have this rough area in the middle that snags my hair when going in and coming out.</li>
            <li> I mean, what can you really say about bobby pins?</li>
            <li> I hate when the little rubber tips wear out and pinch my hair, this hadn&#x27;t happened yet, great price and quality.</li>
            <li> These blend in well with medium to dark blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Did not receive correct color, ordered blonde received dark brown.</li>
            <li> Matched on dark blonde hair well.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use them for updos or very tight holds but rather to keep the small hairs that get out from the sides for a pony tail or just take the bangs out of my face.</li>

            <li> These bobby pins are simple and exactly what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are metal bobby pins, one side is straight, one side is wavy. On the two ends, there is a dot of glue or whatever, so they do not get snagged nor scratch your head. The brown fits in with my light to medium brown hair color great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine and smooth. This causes most bobby pins to slip out. I put them in my hair in a criss-cross manner with two bobby pins with the wavy side toward my head. This keeps them in place for hours on end easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy them again, because HOW DO I ALWAYS LOSE ALL MY BOBBY PINS?!</li>
            <li> Not that it matters that much, but these were a bit discolored.  They work perfectly to hold hair, but if you are particular about not having striped bobby pins, these may not be for you.  But then again, maybe I just got a pack that had been sitting out in the sun or something.</li>
            <li> One can never have enough of these bobby pins!</li>
            <li> Good price and a high quality product.  Much cheaper than in the store.  Great for keeping hair out of your face or in a decretive style.  I would highly recommend these based on their price, quality, and amount.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> these are good bobby pins so far. i always buy mine at the beauty supply store but i needed an add on item so i got these. i love how thick the little ball part is on the ends (women will know how sometimes that part comes off and that can hurt) pretty sturdy so far. and i have thick hair</li>
            <li> They are Bobby Pins.  Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Always losing these things everywhere. I&#x27;m not quite sure why losing bobby pins is such an epidemic but it is. I have a small case for them that came packaged with other pins a couple years ago and they fit fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair color is between brown and blonde so these match perfectly and with proper styling they&#x27;re hard to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is just a weird, in-between shade on its own; but if you happen to have light-medium brown hair with highlights this blends well with the combination of tones.</li>
            <li> These blend in well with medium to dark blonde hair.  They&#x27;re durable and have little rubber tips to prevent poking and irritation.</li>
            <li> This is the best brand quality of bobby pins I have ever used. And I am heavy on bobby pins because I am a ballerina and I put my hair up a lot using elastics, pins and hairnets so I know. They are the tightest.</li>
            <li> This is worth buying.  They are not the cheap ones.  These work!  I used to think bobby pins were bobby pins but I found out otherwise.  I ordered some online, I bought some in the store,.  I learned some people may sell it as a bobby pin but it is just a cheap piece of wire that could not hold hair other than maybe a baby&#x27;s, wasted money. Vidal Sassoon did it right!  These are REAL Bobby Pins!</li>
            <li> Did not receive correct color, ordered blonde received dark brown.</li>
            <li> Looking for bobby pins? Here are bobby pins! Matched on dark blonde hair well.</li>
            <li> Bobby pins, do what they do, work great.</li>
            <li> These are great bobby pins and a great color as it would work with dark blonde to dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in the store so i ordered them here.good for light hair brown and blondes.they are better than other brands cuse the plastic tips stay on.other ones fall off and then you have to throw them away.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with bobby pins for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Good strong bobby pins like they used to make.  Not the Walmart specials that bend so easily.  Like them.</li>
            <li> Good quality not like the cheap pins that you get at bargain type stores.</li>
            <li> My child needed more bobby pins. These were the right color and plenty of them. She ran away happy and they seem to keep her hairdo creations in fine order.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just as described and great price. Anyone who needs bobby pins like old person like me will like it.</li>
            <li> I mean where can you go wrong with bobby pins you can use them for a number of different hairs styles and nothing went wrong with mine so I suggest you stop looking at reviews and just by them.</li>
            <li> These pins hold well. Much better than the sollar store ones. I would say they hold just as well if not better than Goody and Conair pins. Happy this this purchase.</li>
            <li> These seemed shorter than i expected.  For fine hair, at least, they are also very slippery and did not work well for me, using them for hair styling.  For pin curls, they are ok if there is enough hair in each curl.  But when i put them above the neck in back to hold in shorter hairs under a pony tail, they fell out pretty fast.  I tried to use them to pin back hair on the sides, and they fell out even faster.</li>
            <li> These are the worst bobby pins I have ever used.  The top and the bottom of the bobby pin don&#x27;t meet.  Because of that they slip out of hair and do not hold the hair in place.  I do not recommend buying these</li>
            <li> They are bobby pins and do what bobby pins do.  Work great in hair but haven&#x27;t tried picking locks yet.</li>
            <li> You can get them for less than a buck down the street, so I paid amazon twice that for the convenience of - yes - not having to go down the street. Not special - just bobby pins.</li>
            <li> Bobby pins are well made good tip for cushion on scalp.</li>
            <li> Works great, my hair is very fine and rips easily but these are holding up great without slipping out or tearing up my hair. I hate when the little rubber tips wear out and pinch my hair, this hadn&#x27;t happened yet, great price and quality.</li>
            <li> High quality bobby pins. Not much else to say. These work!</li>
            <li> These are terrible, they kept popping out of my hair! I thought bobby pins were the same, but apparently not.</li>
            <li> These are not really tight enough. They are a little too long. Sorry, they just don&#x27;t work the way I would like.</li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult to find a bobby pin that will hold super-fine and slippery hair without tearing it and without sticking out visibly. This bobby pin is the only one I know of that does everything, and the regular drugstores don&#x27;t carry it. So thanks for carrying this product!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Good quality for the price. Great colour that matches my hair. Very happy with them!</li>
            <li> These pins are very well built,  they do the job of holding my hair in place and I&#x27;m satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li> These work just as expected on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair. They stay in place just fine, assuming I put them in right. Plus, the package comes with a lot of &#x27;em, which is great since I seem to lose them pretty easily, meaning I take them out and put them in weird places.</li>
            <li> Not like the old Bobbi pins. These are so thin that they keep twisting. Takes forever to put pin curls in.</li>
            <li> They are bobby pics.  Not flimsy Hold well.</li>
            <li> Wont need to buy any more for a while!</li>
            <li> Terrible bobby pins, they are flimsy, don&#x27;t hold my hair, slide out, and the metal is so thin I can&#x27;t open them with one hand. Wasn&#x27;t worth sending back for the price, but I don&#x27;t use them. Things just aren&#x27;t made the way they used to be, this is my third purchase of new bobby pins (trying different brands) and they range from bad to worse. Save your money, go to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and buy their brand of professional bobby pins (can find on sale 300 for $6). Those are what bobby pins are supposed to be!</li>
            <li> They warp easily. You get what you pay for, I guess</li>
            <li> They have this rough area in the middle that snags my hair when going in and coming out. I&#x27;m probably going to end up throwing them away. Sucks.</li>
            <li> bobby pins as expected</li>
            <li> What can I say, they are bobby pins. My granddaughter had them on her wishlist and I bought them for her. They seem to be a high quality pin. She got them in her Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li> I was looking for nice pins that could hold my hair in place. I don&#x27;t use them for updos or very tight holds but rather to keep the small hairs that get out from the sides for a pony tail or just take the bangs out of my face. My hair is blonde so black pins don&#x27;t blend in. I have very long and very fine hair. The first time I put them, as soon as I walked out of the bathroom I felt they were already getting loose and couple of steps later they were just hanging. I tried putting couple more for more support but they were even sliding from on top of each other. They are very thin and feel flimsy. I was really looking forward for pins that have tight support and after the previous reviews decided to give them a try.. But don&#x27;t spend your money on them and let me know if you know any non-black closed pins that have a good grip..</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture, 60 brown pinched-closed bobby pins. If you need bobby pins, that are brown, and they are the closed kind, then these are for you. Amazon Prime a plus, got it in 2 days like they said.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; bobby pins arrived with another Amazon order and are a great quality. The packaging is nice and fresh, which is important since these will be stocking stuffers for my girls. :)</li>
            <li> i lost them all within a week lol, overall a good purchase</li>
            <li> These bobby pins come in bulk, of course, but are flimsy if you have very thick hair. Once they expand, they break or either cannot be used again. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> These bobby pins are as flimsy as you can get! I thought since they have the Vidal Sassoon name on them they might be good ones, but let me assure you they are NOT! They are very weak and if you are lucky enough to get one to stay in your hair without bending completely out of shape, then it will for sure be unusable for a second time! Do not waste your money on this poor excuse for bobby pins!</li>
            <li> People claim I have black or brown hair. It&#x27;s basically dark brown with those lighter brown highlights- perfect color, price and quantity.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday. I love them. Not cheap and keeps your hair in place. Just how it&#x27;s supposed too. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this brand of bobby pins because I know the brand is good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was Not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Great value for this big lot of bobby pins, well coated.</li>
            <li> Why would any guy use bobby pins. I read a lot and they are great page holders. The only problem is my girlfriend always go to my books for them.</li>
            <li> Works very good with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking everywhere to find this color and the good quality.  As usual it was wonderful  to find this on Amazon at a great price too.</li>
            <li> What can you say but that these are the quality bobby pins you&#x27;re looking for. If needed, will buy more.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy but gets the job done.  Just a basic bobby pin, which was all i was looking for so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are pretty standard bobby pins.  They are a bit lighter and more metallic-looking than in the photo.  I have dark brown hair and I wish I would have gone with black ones - these \\&quot;stick out\\&quot; a little.</li>
            <li> a strong pin with nice rubber tip</li>
            <li> Worth buying.  I&#x27;ve used much crappier bobby pins, and I have used bobby pins a little nicer, but these get the job done in an acceptable manner.  I have thick, barrel curly hair.  My color is lightish brown and this pins look nice, too.</li>
            <li> Perfect and made in USA!</li>
            <li> Pretty bobby pins and very smooth.  Good for root lift.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, color and soft tips.</li>
            <li> They are jagged on both sides and they seem to not stay in as well - they are also not as low profile in your hair</li>
            <li> These work great and with so many I can leave them all over the house and car and wherever I take them out.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite Bobby pins. There are no other brands, in my opinion that can compare to Vidal Sassoon Bobby Pins. I have re-used them over and over and they have held their shape. The only reason I re order is because I misplace my Bobby pins when I take them out of my hair. Otherwise, I would never have to repurchase these again!</li>
            <li> Not much to say about bobby pins but they are nice bobby pins. Good color that can work on dark blonde to med. brown hair and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Decent quality.  They twist a lot when putting the pins in my child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Works like it should!</li>
            <li> Great quality bobby pins! Will order more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard to find bobby pins that are brown. The ladies in my family all have light colored hair so these are what we need. I was glad to find them. Now if I can just keep from losing them or vacuuming them up when I am in the cleaning spirit. We like these bobby pins quite well and they are doing nicely.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t hold up at all.  They twist on you as you open them to place in your hair.  The pins feel thinner than others I have purchased locally.</li>
            <li> these bobby pins simply rock. period. each piece is so good that it&#x27;s not expendable anymore, no matter how many pins you still have remaining;</li>
            <li> These are the strong type of bobby pins that don&#x27;t bend easily. There&#x27;s not much more to say about bobby pins.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
            <li> Like every other person in the universe, I have bought over 3000 bobby pins in my life, but have 5 left :)  .... So, needed to purchase more. Nice product and hope I don&#x27;t lose all of them</li>
            <li> they hold my hair out of my eyes or up on my head as promised.</li>
            <li> I mean, what can you really say about bobby pins? They work.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re bobby pins. Can&#x27;t usually go wrong with a bobby pin.</li>
            <li> Very soft dosent hold the hair properly..nice color though</li>
            <li> They slide off within minutes.  They don&#x27;t hold my hair, whether I use them to pull back a few hairs on the side or to hold a bun in place.  They fall out no matter what and I&#x27;m left with bobby pins sticking out and dangling while my hair looks like a mess.</li>
            <li> i mean just normal bobby pins but thats what i wanted :)</li>
