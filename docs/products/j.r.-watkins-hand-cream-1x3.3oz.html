            <li>Found this  hand cream last year and love love it , my daughter and daughter in law came over for Xmas and that was it , you now have more fans !!!</li>
            <li>Moisturizing cream, but the lavender scent is overwhelming and strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a potter, and the constant clay and water is incredibly drying.</li>
            <li>Fragrance too strong for me</li>
            <li>Scent is so strong</li>
            <li>Hands down this is the best hand cream ever!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Amazing hand cream, this is definitely my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>FYI, this is also available in an 11-ounce version: this is the 3.3-ounce container.</li>
            <li>This is a nice smelling lavender, I really like it</li>
            <li>Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The cream is thick, but not greasy and goes into the skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Smells lovely (if you like lavender), and keeps your hands feeling soft and happy for a long while!</li>
            <li>Also, the fragrance scent is mild.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and the lavender scent is so relaxing.  </li>
            <li>They love the smell and how soft it makes their hands</li>
            <li>Obviously, there are other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; creams available but for the price, this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>my hand became as smooth and soft as in the summer.</li>
            <li>I purchase many different types of creams</li>
            <li>This was exactly as needed.</li>
            <li>A most well received Xmas present.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other hand lotion I&#x27;ve tried, and I love that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This cream gives me a clean smell and keeps my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>Usually NOT on their heads and faces, but more likely if you rub it into arms, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very calming.</li>
            <li>but I have to admit this one is very silky and really helps to soften the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have since started making my own solid lotion bars, but before that, this was one of the only creams that could handle my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a fine hand cream; is non-greasy and a little bit goes a long way; also good if have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Strong scent that fades after application to expected level.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the only products I&#x27;ve found to really help alleviate my very sinsitive, allergy prone hands.</li>
            <li>I rarely use it, as my hands never seem too dry, but every guest that stops by and uses our sink sees the lotion and use it.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this and it smells really nice - more like natural lavender than the fake lavender scent of other hand creams that she has had, or</li>
            <li>It makes my hands feel really soft.  </li>
            <li>The Lavender fragrance is natural and heavenly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only downside for this lotion -- it can cause reactions for sensitive or dry or sunburned skin -- red, bumpy, itchy rashes.  </li>
            <li>I also use a little of this cream on my face and it also works very well. .</li>
            <li>When they get too much sun, the kids can get a little headache-y.  </li>

            <li> Good quality, rich moisture and the flavor is nature.  My wife likes it.</li>
            <li> I like this hand cream a lot. It&#x27;s a tad heavy for me but I add essential oils to it and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It you like lavender, don&#x27;t miss out on this amazing hand cream!</li>
            <li> This cream is too greasy and takes a long time to absorb into my skin. It smells nice, but I prefer unscented hand cream.</li>
            <li> Wonderful softness and great smell</li>
            <li> Not a very strong lavendar smell.  It&#x27;s a bit thick but I will try it.  The shea butter does help coat the skin, just wish the lavendar scent was stronger.</li>
            <li> Amazing hand cream, this is definitely my new favorite.  I keep it at my work desk and use it a few times a day.  The flavor is true lavender (none of that fake stuff) and is a thick cream that absorbs well to moisturize for long periods of time, even after thoroughly washing my hands with soap.  Will definitely be buying again, and as gifts!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and it smells really nice - more like natural lavender than the fake lavender scent of other hand creams that she has had, or so she claims.  My mom liked it too.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing cream, but the lavender scent is overwhelming and strong.</li>
            <li> Fragrance too strong for me</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hand/foot cream made from natural ingredients without paraben (wax), alcohol, and chemicals. After you rub it on your skin you do not have to worry about staining your clothes because there is not any oily residue. Also, the fragrance scent is mild. My girlfriend likes the lavender and mango scented creams on me. Obviously, there are other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; creams available but for the price, this is a great deal. FYI, this is also available in an 11-ounce version: this is the 3.3-ounce container.</li>
            <li> I rarely use it, as my hands never seem too dry, but every guest that stops by and uses our sink sees the lotion and use it. They love the smell and how soft it makes their hands and I&#x27;ve noticed Watkins hand creams in their houses now too. The lavender smell is great and not too intense.</li>
            <li> Found this  hand cream last year and love love it , my daughter and daughter in law came over for Xmas and that was it , you now have more fans !!! A great find !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer and non-greasy.  Strong scent that fades after application to expected level.  Doesn&#x27;t leave skin drier after application as some moisturizers seem to do with my skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and my hands feel moisturized and smooth without feeling greasy. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of lavender and this lotion does not disappoint.  Does not smell like chemicals, but actual lavender.  The cream is thick, but not greasy and goes into the skin perfectly.  I use nightly on hands and feet and just love this brand and this product.</li>
            <li> My work involves contacting a lot of water everyday. In Nov my hands became very dry and rough, and some areas even began to bleed. I bought this item and after usage for several days my hand became as smooth and soft as in the summer. I also use a little of this cream on my face and it also works very well. .</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the best hand cream ever! I love how good it smells... It&#x27;s very calming. Good price!</li>
            <li> Scent is so strong it&#x27;s nauseating. I sooo wish this company offered an unscented version!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchase many different types of creams but I have to admit this one is very silky and really helps to soften the skin.  I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li> A very rich and creamy hand cream!  This is my second purchase and I have not been disappointed.  It  smells wonderful and lavender is also great for healing and moisturizing dry, cracked skin.  It makes my hands feel really soft.  I would definitely recommend this hand cream!</li>
            <li> And the best part is that it moisturizes my hands wonderfully without feeling greasy. Absorbs quickly and the lavender scent is so relaxing.  I keep this next to my bed and it&#x27;s the last thing I do every night before sleep.  I love it!</li>

            <li> I have a child who doesn&#x27;t take medicines well, and anyway I hate to give the kids medicine.  When they get too much sun, the kids can get a little headache-y.  I like to give them a lot of water to drink and then rub some of this WONDERFUL smelling lavender lotion up into their foreheads and temples.  They&#x27;re all set to find a spot and play Battleship or Monopoly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside for this lotion -- it can cause reactions for sensitive or dry or sunburned skin -- red, bumpy, itchy rashes.  Usually NOT on their heads and faces, but more likely if you rub it into arms, etc.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Highest compliments from my wife on this hand cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling product ever</li>
            <li> Works better than any other hand lotion I&#x27;ve tried, and I love that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Needed a protective hand cream for winter. This was exactly as needed. Lavender scent was a plus. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it makes my hands nice and smooth. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Nice size for travel or in your purse.</li>
            <li> I have since started making my own solid lotion bars, but before that, this was one of the only creams that could handle my skin. I&#x27;m a potter, and the constant clay and water is incredibly drying. This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I use sanitizer a lot during the day.  This cream gives me a clean smell and keeps my hands soft.  I like J.R. Watkins products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Smells lovely (if you like lavender), and keeps your hands feeling soft and happy for a long while! This is one of the only products I&#x27;ve found to really help alleviate my very sinsitive, allergy prone hands.</li>
