            <li>Just started using it as well as some other great serums i got a greal deal on here at amazon.  </li>
            <li>arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin</li>
            <li>Mild plant odor.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and it doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy/oily feeling afterwards and I have no issues with applying makeup afterwards.</li>
            <li>Moisturise me because it would melt quickly to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will come back for more updates from using it more.</li>
            <li>The serum soaks into the skin and dries rather quickly.</li>
            <li>For anyone who is looking for a natural and seriously effective skin care product, this serum is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed has even provided better results particularly alongside vitamin E.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moisturized</li>
            <li>I am very interested in health.</li>
            <li>Use it daily and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also proven to dramatically increase the production of collagen and cellular turnover, resulting in a much smoother texture and even skin tone!!</li>
            <li>I noticed that it made my skin look brighter in a positive way and the bags under my eyes were not as obvious which I loved.</li>
            <li>Best to use with moisturizer, removes dead skin and clarifies skin!!!</li>
            <li>That does amazing things topically for the skin and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Feels nice but don&#x27;t think there is any benefit I have used it for several months and don&#x27;t see reduction in wrinkles or lines</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that not only does this keep my wrinkles from showing, it is also cruelty free</li>
            <li>also love that it&#x27;s completely vegan and cruelty</li>
            <li>useful for my skin.</li>
            <li>Worth a shot</li>
            <li>So far I love the results.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, it&#x27;s comparable to rotten meat, which being a former deli employee, you never forget the scent of.</li>
            <li>There is no greasy feeling after using and I can apply my makeup right after using.</li>
            <li>, so I put vitamin C serum on two boils under my right arm, underarm.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel great and my dark spots are even lightening up!!</li>
            <li>there very lightly so I&#x27;m hoping this will help lighten them a little more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had lots of problems with old acne scars and even some old scratches and blemishes over the years and this serum helps smooth them out, leaving my skin brighter and more springy to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY vitamin C serums from Amazon and they leave your skin more dried after use.  </li>
            <li>No irritation, still very gentle on skin</li>
            <li>( some days I alternate with a very light cream retinol preparation).</li>
            <li>New at using oils but am excited to try them out.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel soft and supple and helps to promote a wrinkle free face.</li>
            <li>and I love the results: even skin tone and definitely less fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>, she has no idea where she got it in the first place.</li>
            <li>Sinks into the skin nicely</li>
            <li>Really like this Serum!</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>I really like that this product is made in the USA!</li>
            <li>These serums have been proven to dramatically increase collagen production and it also increases cellular turnover, which results in a more even skin tone and an overall smoother texture.</li>
            <li>My skin is feeling so refreshed and much firmer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really inexpensive too which is always a plus!</li>
            <li>That is good for me because I&#x27;m impatient.</li>
            <li>You can take Vitamin C as a pill everyday, but studies show that it&#x27;s effects are more effective when applied directly to the skin as it&#x27;s absorbed much faster.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>After receiving this professional anti aging serum I was excited to see how it works.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this Bellafab Vitamin C professional Anti Aging serum.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you want a natural serum, there should be no dyes or perfumes present, although I believe there  has to be something they can find that is organic that can lighten the scent and make it a little more pleasant, but what do I know.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hoping for positive results.</li>
            <li>i ordered this based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>It is an easily applied serum and works fast to diminish fine lines and lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li>ive noticed a large difference in the lines on my forehead</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality serum that I highly recommend you try!</li>
            <li>As with other vitamin C serums, follow with  good quality moisturizer, as your old skin will need the moisturizer until the new skin replaces it.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s very runny.  </li>
            <li>AND IM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE RESULTS  </li>
            <li>My wife really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>I think the product really soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t just sit on your skin.</li>
            <li>it does work fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Everyone comments how much brighter my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>Thanks RLT.</li>
            <li>The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get too much at a time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;shipping was fast, after 3 days of purchase</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen Result as fast a 2 days of using it.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve continued using it for the last two days in the morning with a light moisturizer over it</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much...</li>
            <li>I really like the serum.</li>
            <li>This combination of ingredients is working very well on my face and is reducing age spots and clearing my face.  </li>
            <li>not so much a serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, and this is really helping me the reduce the aging lines I get under my eyes and on the sides of my head.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a big difference in how smooth and radiant my skin looks and feels now.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my hands because I am a nurse and have to wash my hands so much at work.</li>
            <li>without much hassle.</li>
            <li>I am completely and utterly in love with this product and will definitely be buying it again once I run out.</li>
            <li>The directions are clear as to how to use, if you want nicer smooth and soft skin this product is for you .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, dried quickly, and applied my make up over it.</li>
            <li>The formula is thicker and more turbid than other serums, and it is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting considering the size and effective.</li>

            <li> arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin</li>
            <li> Mild plant odor.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and it doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy/oily feeling afterwards and I have no issues with applying makeup afterwards.</li>
            <li> Moisturise me because it would melt quickly to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will come back for more updates from using it more.</li>
            <li> The serum soaks into the skin and dries rather quickly.</li>
            <li> For anyone who is looking for a natural and seriously effective skin care product, this serum is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed has even provided better results particularly alongside vitamin E.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moisturized</li>
            <li> I am very interested in health.</li>
            <li> Use it daily and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also proven to dramatically increase the production of collagen and cellular turnover, resulting in a much smoother texture and even skin tone!!</li>
            <li> I noticed that it made my skin look brighter in a positive way and the bags under my eyes were not as obvious which I loved.</li>
            <li> Best to use with moisturizer, removes dead skin and clarifies skin!!!</li>
            <li> That does amazing things topically for the skin and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Feels nice but don&#x27;t think there is any benefit I have used it for several months and don&#x27;t see reduction in wrinkles or lines</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that not only does this keep my wrinkles from showing, it is also cruelty free</li>
            <li> also love that it&#x27;s completely vegan and cruelty</li>
            <li> useful for my skin.</li>
            <li> Worth a shot</li>
            <li> So far I love the results.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, it&#x27;s comparable to rotten meat, which being a former deli employee, you never forget the scent of.</li>
            <li> There is no greasy feeling after using and I can apply my makeup right after using.</li>
            <li> , so I put vitamin C serum on two boils under my right arm, underarm.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great and my dark spots are even lightening up!!</li>
            <li> there very lightly so I&#x27;m hoping this will help lighten them a little more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lots of problems with old acne scars and even some old scratches and blemishes over the years and this serum helps smooth them out, leaving my skin brighter and more springy to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY vitamin C serums from Amazon and they leave your skin more dried after use.  </li>
            <li> No irritation, still very gentle on skin</li>
            <li> ( some days I alternate with a very light cream retinol preparation).</li>
            <li> New at using oils but am excited to try them out.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel soft and supple and helps to promote a wrinkle free face.</li>
            <li> and I love the results: even skin tone and definitely less fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> , she has no idea where she got it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Sinks into the skin nicely</li>
            <li> Really like this Serum!</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> I really like that this product is made in the USA!</li>
            <li> These serums have been proven to dramatically increase collagen production and it also increases cellular turnover, which results in a more even skin tone and an overall smoother texture.</li>
            <li> My skin is feeling so refreshed and much firmer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really inexpensive too which is always a plus!</li>
            <li> That is good for me because I&#x27;m impatient.</li>
            <li> You can take Vitamin C as a pill everyday, but studies show that it&#x27;s effects are more effective when applied directly to the skin as it&#x27;s absorbed much faster.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> After receiving this professional anti aging serum I was excited to see how it works.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this Bellafab Vitamin C professional Anti Aging serum.</li>
            <li> Of course, if you want a natural serum, there should be no dyes or perfumes present, although I believe there  has to be something they can find that is organic that can lighten the scent and make it a little more pleasant, but what do I know.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hoping for positive results.</li>
            <li> i ordered this based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> It is an easily applied serum and works fast to diminish fine lines and lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> ive noticed a large difference in the lines on my forehead</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality serum that I highly recommend you try!</li>
            <li> As with other vitamin C serums, follow with  good quality moisturizer, as your old skin will need the moisturizer until the new skin replaces it.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very runny.  </li>
            <li> AND IM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE RESULTS  </li>
            <li> My wife really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I think the product really soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t just sit on your skin.</li>
            <li> it does work fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Everyone comments how much brighter my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> Thanks RLT.</li>
            <li> The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get too much at a time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;shipping was fast, after 3 days of purchase</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen Result as fast a 2 days of using it.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve continued using it for the last two days in the morning with a light moisturizer over it</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use much...</li>
            <li> I really like the serum.</li>
            <li> This combination of ingredients is working very well on my face and is reducing age spots and clearing my face.  </li>
            <li> not so much a serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and this is really helping me the reduce the aging lines I get under my eyes and on the sides of my head.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference in how smooth and radiant my skin looks and feels now.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my hands because I am a nurse and have to wash my hands so much at work.</li>
            <li> without much hassle.</li>
            <li> I am completely and utterly in love with this product and will definitely be buying it again once I run out.</li>
            <li> The directions are clear as to how to use, if you want nicer smooth and soft skin this product is for you .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, dried quickly, and applied my make up over it.</li>
            <li> The formula is thicker and more turbid than other serums, and it is not sticky.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting considering the size and effective.</li>
            <li> This serum combines more than just vitamin C but also provides collagen, which normally not common to see from other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also wishing to see more result on dark spots.</li>
            <li> vitamin c serum does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is safe for all skin types,Best anti aging, anti wrinkle serum and dark spot corrector to give you the results that you want and desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tend to have very sensitive dry skin that breaks out easily when I use products to gain moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even someone who normally goes in for the whole &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; approach to skincare, but this is a total gamechanger for me.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it works very well with my skin type.</li>
            <li> After I completely use the whole bottle, I</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this Vitamin C and E serum skin cream because of its promise to help with anti-aging and uneven skin tones.  </li>
            <li> I did a ton of research to find just the right product in the hyaluronic line before I finally settled on this one.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serums are your way of fighting back and not only reducing the onset of fine lines and wrinkles, but correcting what&#x27;s already started to show.</li>
            <li> It Does Not really feels like a rich serum.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new consumer when it comes to skincare serums.</li>
            <li> and I feel like a new woman.  </li>
            <li> AND MY NECK IS SO SOFT!  </li>

            <li> makes me feel young!</li>
            <li> 20% vitamin c concentration is pretty standard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all organic, natural and made in the USA!</li>
            <li> i have used various vit c products for years and this is the first time</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the serum is quite thin and looks like water.</li>
            <li> Visually my fine lines are less noticeable and my eye area looks brighter and refreshed.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s naturally present in the body, it&#x27;s perfectly safe to combine with other skin care products and</li>
            <li> Fine lines smoother, slight tightening of jawline and neck, pores almost non discernable.</li>
            <li> On some occasions, it has known to cause a bit of dry skin, but that can be combated by applying a moisturizer after the serum has been absorbed.</li>
            <li> Wow wow wow ...</li>
            <li> This one leaves your skin soft feeling and without the dryness.</li>

            <li> natural Bellafab Skincare-Vit.</li>
            <li> I should send pics of me , This makes my 60 year old skin look 40</li>
            <li> have extremely sensitive skin and had no issues or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now this makes my skin all soft</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m just too old.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle cure as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> No heavy cream on my face which I like a lot.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth, firm and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;so far been using this for 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and it feels young again.</li>
            <li> This really depends on your age, condition of the skin, and how it&#x27;s been taken care of prior to using the serum.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and alive</li>
            <li> I use a dropper after washing my face, thick so not runny and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Well because I was so excited I went and washed my face to get rid of any dirt as recommend on the bottle and applied a small amount to my face.</li>
            <li> So far I am still using &amp; evaluating this facial product.</li>
            <li> It is thick and goes on smoothly with a non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li> and I am again wowed at how much my skin is glowing how much tighter my face looks and feels, I had dark circle which I have been using another product on twice daily until receiving this that are down to a bare minimum</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick like other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> Even as little as the first night having it I woke up and seen a small but very visible change in my face</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts a long time as you only need a few drops for your whole face.</li>
            <li> Ok so First of all I wanted to say, I hate reading reviews in Amazon cos&lt;br /&gt;one,</li>
            <li> Factor in other things like UV rays and and air pollutants and the Vitamin C that&#x27;s found naturally in your skin starts to break down which contributes to the obvious signs of aging.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are not very dark</li>
            <li> Been using this serum for a few weeks now and my skin is softer, smoother and the old acne scars are fading.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had it so long</li>
            <li> after using this serum, moisturizing lasted long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but NOT sticky and dries fast.</li>
            <li> , it was brighter, tighter, even some of my acne which I have recently started having, which makes my face red and blotchy in places had calmed down.</li>
            <li> Not a happy chic right now.</li>
            <li> You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> I had read that sometimes Vitamin C causes dry skin</li>
            <li> I can feel my face being not so dry</li>
            <li> I recommend allowing to dry and then apply mosturizer.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, moisturize before use and allow 20 minutes to set before you use the serum.</li>
            <li> It does not really hydrate my skin for a long time</li>
            <li> apply this once daily, typically after exfoliating, in the morning.</li>
            <li> and I have only a small amount left.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Add to that our hormonal fluctuations and past skin damage from too much sun exposure and past acne.  </li>
            <li> However it is never to early or to late to start taking care of your skin.</li>
            <li> So far I have not had any negative effects.</li>
            <li> I didnt work as expected.</li>
            <li> So the wait time is minimal before applying my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops is sufficient enough to cover the problem areas of the face and neck.</li>
            <li> so although there are a few signs of aging, my results seemed quicker because I&#x27;m younger with healthier skin to start out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She also has an old scar that is slowly fading from using it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t attest to its long term effects yet, but will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Other (CHEAPER)</li>
            <li> Vitamin c serum is extremely beneficial to your skin as it fades sunspots, reduces discoloration, refines skin texture and reduces lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle, but you only need apply a little per application.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a month and not seeing any difference in my dark spots, darn.</li>
            <li> and that it removed dark spots.  </li>
            <li> my black spots of blemishes vanishing so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried close to a half dozen vitamin C serums-</li>
            <li> I also have less wrinkles around  my eyes and forehead since using this product.</li>
            <li> Once applied, if you wait longer than 5 min to apply moisturizer, your face will feel really tight and begin to itch.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of Dark Spots !</li>
            <li> It looks smoother and a little of my redness on my cheeks is already gone</li>
            <li> I have seen results in as little as 2-4 weeks while using the Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I think after using it for a few weeks I will see a difference in those sun spots.</li>
            <li> I will post again on a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use everyday</li>
            <li> after a few weeks I can see no change in my skin, it doesn&#x27;t lighten anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These types of products are designed to help slow down the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I saw results after a few days!</li>
            <li> I have to try really hard to get past the scent just to get it on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE HAD A HARD TIME TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING TO LIGHTEN IT UP AND GET MY SKIN TONE MATCHED UP.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever write a review..</li>
            <li> I continued to put the vitamin C serum on the boils and they slowly vanished.</li>
            <li> So when it was on its side, it slowly drips out.</li>
            <li> But I have very bad aged old sun spots.</li>
            <li> they must be fictitious.. seriously save your money and stick with a brand name.  </li>
            <li> HARD TO USE BECAUSE IT IS AS THIN AS WATER.</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave any greasy feeling on my face and I havent noticed any bad smells like some other reviewers have.</li>
            <li> to see a dramatic change.</li>
            <li> didnt notice any dramatic appearance by today (day4),  may take longer.</li>
            <li> MY NECK GOT A REALLY NASTY RASH THAT LEFT AN UGLY DARK MARK AND</li>
            <li> 100% fake item we try it and</li>
            <li> As someone that is obsessed with using vitamin C serums</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I had age spots really bad on my neck and decolletage and  they are fading.</li>
            <li> So needless to say I am very disappointed that it leaked</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this vitamin c serum. It has helped add moisture to my skin and has made it look brighter and has given me a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> After receiving this professional anti aging serum I was excited to see how it works. Well because I was so excited I went and washed my face to get rid of any dirt as recommend on the bottle and applied a small amount to my face. I felt that it was a very nice texture and did not leave my skin feeling sticky or crusty. I noticed that it made my skin look brighter in a positive way and the bags under my eyes were not as obvious which I loved. So overall I would say this anti aging is true to its name and the best part is it has ingredients I love. This product is something I would recommend to others and will be using more often.</li>
            <li> I love having vitamin c for your face. This is a very nice serum and works really well.</li>
            <li> Gave this product plenty of use before my review.  The formula is thicker and more turbid than other serums, and it is not sticky.  I have tried MANY vitamin C serums from Amazon and they leave your skin more dried after use.  This one leaves your skin soft feeling and without the dryness.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a while and have not noticed anything at all.  Also, it&#x27;s very runny.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Applying every night!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Feels great! Hoping for positive results.</li>
            <li> I SAW A WRITE UP ON VITAMIN C SERUM IN A MAGAZINE ARTICLE SO I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A GO AND IM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE RESULTS  THAT I GOT! MY NECK GOT A REALLY NASTY RASH THAT LEFT AN UGLY DARK MARK AND I&#x27;VE HAD A HARD TIME TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING TO LIGHTEN IT UP AND GET MY SKIN TONE MATCHED UP.  WELL I STARTED OFF USING THE SERUM ONLY ONCE A DAY TO SEE IF I ACTUALLY NOTICED A DIFFERENCE. AFTER 3 DAYS OF USING IT MY NECK HAD NOTICABLY LIGHTENED UP SO I INCREASED THE DAILY USAGE UP TO TWO TIMES A DAY INSTEAD OF ONCE AND MY NECK IS SO SOFT!  MY SKIN TONE IS LIKE IT WAS BEFORE THE RASH EVER OCCURED SO I&#x27;M KEEPING THIS AROUND AND SPREADING THE WORD ON SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT!! THIS WAS A DISCOUNTED ITEM USED FOR REVIEW PURPOSES.</li>
            <li> It is really good. My wife really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so nice and soft after using this product. Will be using it daily.</li>
            <li> Got it as a Christmas present for my mother in law, she loves it! She said she could feel it working on her skin as soon as she put it on.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smoother, love it.</li>
            <li> This has a really pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  I love how when I apply it, I can feel my skin tighten as it dries.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week so I can&#x27;t attest to its long term effects yet, but will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Awesome product works great!</li>
            <li> Use it on my face every day and can already feel the difference. Great product!</li>
            <li> I am very interested in health. So naturally Make sure you get good things for your health. I had a good chance to use if you want to buy also a great opportunity came next.</li>
            <li> So nice and gentle. Love it !  Gets rid of Dark Spots !</li>
            <li> arrived quickly.  Just started using it as well as some other great serums i got a greal deal on here at amazon.  It absorbs quickly into the skin - hope it works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Wow wow wow ...my black spots of blemishes vanishing so well.Im super happy I bought this .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried close to a half dozen vitamin C serums- this one being the most expensive. Starting using it the day I received it &amp; after three weeks I see no results. Other (CHEAPER) Vit C serums gave me a healthy glow and improved the texture of my skin. Gave two stars bc it smells great- only positive I can think of. Definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I didnt work as expected. But I have very bad aged old sun spots.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin getting healtier and brighter. Great product.</li>
            <li> Feels nice but don&#x27;t think there is any benefit I have used it for several months and don&#x27;t see reduction in wrinkles or lines</li>
            <li> No change in my skin after using for a month. It&#x27;s not thick like other reviewers stated. Mild plant odor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and I like the results. This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Works well. Have noticed a difference since using.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in my skin almost immediately.  It looks smoother and a little of my redness on my cheeks is already gone</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great and my dark spots are even lightening up!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks &amp; my skin feels amazing!! It absorbs well &amp; brightens my skin. People keep asking me if I have recently gone to a medical spa for a fancy chemical peel and nope!! It&#x27;s this bottle of fabulousness!!! I will definitely be re ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I was given an opportunity to write a review for the Bellafab Skincare-Vit. C Serum 20% skin cream purchased at a deep discount.  I was very excited to get this Vitamin C and E serum skin cream because of its promise to help with anti-aging and uneven skin tones.  It is safe for all skin types, only takes a few drops to cover your face, is non-greasy, and absorbs readily on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All skin types experience environmental exposures and that ages our skin.  Add to that our hormonal fluctuations and past skin damage from too much sun exposure and past acne.  Then your skin may develop surface discolorations such as acne marks and age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This skin cream contains the highest form of vitamin C and E as well as hyaluronic acid to encourage skin softness. The way the Bellafab Skincare-Vit. C Serum 20% works is to promote the production of your natural collagen and increase cell turnover. Of course, results may vary depending on your skin type and condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lift away discoloration and bring more new healthy skin cells to the surface.  Notice a smoother texture of your skin and a more even skin tone with fewer discolorations. PAMPER your skin with this rich natural Bellafab Skincare-Vit. C Serum 20% skin cream.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed, the last one I tried was much more impressive.</li>
            <li> This seems to work well jun conjunction with another product that contains retinol. Long lasting considering the size and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that not only does this keep my wrinkles from showing, it is also cruelty free so I can sleep soundly at night knowing i&#x27;m not benefitting off of anothers pain.</li>
            <li> Great to use for non greasy and effective skin care. I like that it makes my skin feel soft and supple and helps to promote a wrinkle free face.</li>
            <li> Love this use it every night since starting my skin is amazing</li>
            <li> This serum is great. It goes on very smooth. I put it on after my morning shower and it invigorates my skin while evening out the tone. I have very dry skin so I put this on under my moisturizer. I have used it for about a month and I love the results: even skin tone and definitely less fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> HARD TO USE BECAUSE IT IS AS THIN AS WATER.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serums are known to have many benefits to help fight anti-aging. I started to see some sun spots show up here and there very lightly so I&#x27;m hoping this will help lighten them a little more. The texture of the products is nice, exactly what you would expect. I think the product really soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t just sit on your skin. The scent is pleasant and overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I think after using it for a few weeks I will see a difference in those sun spots. Great product and seller!</li>
            <li> *I received this product in return for my honest opinion. All opinions are my own*&lt;br /&gt;  I am relatively new consumer when it comes to skincare serums. However it is never to early or to late to start taking care of your skin. I had read some excellent reviews on the benefits of Vitamin C Serums and I was happy to test this product out. I had read that are not only great with fight the fine lines and wrinkles but is also helps correct the fine line and wrinkles that you all ready have as well as help reduce the look of age spots. I applied it once daily, first thing in the morning after applying toner and before applying my moisturizer. I had read that sometimes Vitamin C causes dry skin however I didn&#x27;t have an issue with it and my combination skin. It absorbs quickly and it doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy/oily feeling afterwards and I have no issues with applying makeup afterwards. I was really pleased with the product and my skin looks more radiant and youthful. The only thing that prevented me from giving this a five star review quiet frankly was the smell. It has a greasy pepperoni smell which was a big turn off especially being a vegetarian.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  I will try another brand!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best! My skin feels so smooth after I apply it.</li>
            <li> love it ! it does work fast. I use it under my make up. makes me feel young! I&#x27;m 56</li>
            <li> Looking forward to future results!</li>
            <li> This serum is great! Goes on light and absorbs quickly. That is good for me because I&#x27;m impatient. So the wait time is minimal before applying my moisturizer. It is helping to diminish my fine lines around my eyes and forehead. Great product!</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a strong vitamin C serum! No irritation, still very gentle on skin</li>
            <li> I should send pics of me , This makes my 60 year old skin look 40</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum Has Been Shown To Stimulate Collagen and Decrease Fine Lines and Wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have to say, this serum makes a huge difference in my skin!! I am 45 and i am so grateful for this product. I can feel it working on my skin when i put it on. I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum. It is an easily applied serum and works fast to diminish fine lines and lighten dark spots. I am a Vitamin C serum user and find this one to be excellent. As with other vitamin C serums, follow with  good quality moisturizer, as your old skin will need the moisturizer until the new skin replaces it. Try this, you will love it.</li>
            <li> Unlike almost everyone that rated this product, I actually paid for it. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin-with the exception of it being dryer.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I am 61 and I have been using for a couple of weeks and can tell a difference in my skin already. I use after my shower and my skin is softer, pores are smaller, and my skin is tighter. It leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed after using. I had age spots really bad on my neck and decolletage and  they are fading. There is no greasy feeling after using and I can apply my makeup right after using. A little goes a long way. I also have less wrinkles around  my eyes and forehead since using this product.</li>
            <li> I love Bellfab&#x27;s vitamin C serum.  It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly.  Everyone comments how much brighter my skin looks.  Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Use it daily and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell it smells mildly botanical and natural.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth without looking or feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and had no issues or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bellafab Vitamin C Serum is a great product to keep skin young and vibrant, I recommend using it on a nightly ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it&#x27;s completely vegan and cruelty free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a discounted product for testing however my opinions are honest.</li>
            <li> So good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Younger skin</li>
            <li> Maybe I have not given this enough time or it is not what Dr OZ was talking about. Still going to give it more time.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes great.  Doesn&#x27;t have a smell. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I had bought this on a discounted price. After using this, I noticed that my skin felt softer for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this product and I alternate using it in the evening or morning depending on whether I remember to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Received on time. New at using oils but am excited to try them out. I will post again on a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review and am so glad I purchased it.  My skin looks fantastic!  It does everything is says it does and more.  I&#x27;m 56 and fair-skinned and I feel like a new woman.  Really brightened my skin tone, faded the spots, and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> Been using this serum for a few weeks now and my skin is softer, smoother and the old acne scars are fading.  This product has definitely brightened up my skin.</li>
            <li> Anticipate wonderful results</li>
            <li> Using this daily and I have noticed that it helps me absorb my moisturizer more&lt;br /&gt; I can feel my face being not so dry</li>
            <li> This serum goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This seems like a nice product. I just started using it so I don&#x27;t have results to post yet.</li>
            <li> Makes skin look and feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Just received the product and put it on this morning. Easy to use, dried quickly, and applied my make up over it. Looking forward to younger skin!!!</li>
            <li> It Does Not really feels like a rich serum. It does not really hydrate my skin for a long time</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful for my skin. Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Very good product, big difference with skin  appearance.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! !! I makes my skin look and feel so smooth. I have sensitive skin and it works very well with my skin type.</li>
            <li> could see a difference in just 1 week</li>
            <li> So far I am still using &amp; evaluating this facial product. The tightening effect is nice. After I completely use the whole bottle, I&lt;br /&gt;hope to see a dramatic change. Thanks RLT.</li>
            <li> Moisturise me because it would melt quickly to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;My face is better now.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a month and not seeing any difference in my dark spots, darn. Worth a shot I guess.</li>
            <li> I use it around my eyes and lips at night. Not too oily.</li>
            <li> I use vitamin c serum to help rebuild collagen to maintain elasticity and repair the signs of aging. There is lots of research on its benefits. Also contains hyaluronic acid which helps increase hydration in the skin. I&#x27;m into protecting my skin and helping maintain its appearance.  I use a dropper after washing my face, thick so not runny and easy to apply.  I recommend allowing to dry and then apply mosturizer. 20% vitamin c concentration is pretty standard.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well into skin, makes it feel well moisturized!</li>
            <li> Now this makes my skin all soft it&#x27;s som I use everyday</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I use day and night and already see results around my eyes. It&#x27;s thick but NOT sticky and dries fast. Wonderful product, highly recommend for wrinkles and crows feet around the eyes.</li>
            <li> very useful and i can feel my skin is very bright now</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle faithfully every morning and night.  It claims to be the best Vitamin C Serum and that it removed dark spots.  My dark spots are not very dark so I believed this product would work.  After using the entire contents of the bottle, there was no difference. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Works well.  My skin feels light and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many vitamin C serum before, they are all great, but I would like to try this serum one more time. This serum combines more than just vitamin C but also provides collagen, which normally not common to see from other products. I&#x27;m also wishing to see more result on dark spots. Will come back for more updates from using it more.</li>
            <li> After been using it for a while I don&#x27;t see anything changed but it&#x27;s not irritate my skin maybe it&#x27;s not match my skin type or I&#x27;m just too old.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t tell you this stuff makes me look ten years younger. That may take some time.  If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin. My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use. You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger. If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did. The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you. This vitamin c serum works good for my wife and i&#x27;m sure it will work good for you.  It is great to know what you are putting on your skin and how to do it correctly. My wife got rid of a wart with Vitamin C Serum. She also has an old scar that is slowly fading from using it. She&#x27;s had it so long, she has no idea where she got it in the first place. Vitamin C Serum is doing wonders for her skin. I&#x27;m wondering if it works on boils, which I am going to try today to see what the results will be. This is a miracle cure as far as I am concerned. It won&#x27;t make you younger, but it will make your skin look younger. Update-Day two of using Vitamin C Serum on my two boils&#x3D;the pain is gone and some of the swelling has stopped. I will continue to use it to see if this product will actually take boils away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I put vitamin C serum on two boils under my right arm, underarm. After two days, the swelling and burning went away, thankfully. I continued to put the vitamin C serum on the boils and they slowly vanished. This is the coolest stuff they ever made. My wife is now putting it on a boil that she has and it is working for her too. Receiving the free Vitamin C serum was a great added bonus. I am now telling my friends how great vitamin C serum works for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  So far I love the results.  Shipping was fast and the customer service is excellent!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and I am very happy with it! I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> My face is looking more youthful</li>
            <li> Love how this has a brightening affect on my face immediately after use.</li>
            <li> High quality and good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Science backs up the claims about what this does for skin. I can tell you my skin looks better after using it a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I am impressed at how this product feels on my skin as well as how my skin looks. I tend to have very sensitive dry skin that breaks out easily when I use products to gain moisture. So far I have not had any negative effects. Which makes me a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I love the serums no doubt. No heavy cream on my face which I like a lot. I tend to use this in the morning or after a shower ( some days I alternate with a very light cream retinol preparation). I wonder if there is a way to dilute it and use for a body spray?</li>
            <li> another great serum from Bellafab!</li>
            <li> Well I don&#x27;t look 10 years younger yet, but I am getting there with this product! It&#x27;s safe and effective! It&#x27;s all organic, natural and made in the USA! Don&#x27;t trust anything from China, just saying. Just in the short time I have been using this product, my skin is clearer and tighter than ever! It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. This is a very high quality serum that I highly recommend you try! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am all for anti aging, anti wrinkle products. I love that this is straight Vitamin C for my face. I like the product and the eye dropper so I don&#x27;t get too much at a time. I have added this to my daily routine and have found my face is clearer and looks cleaner, smoother. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love. Sinks into the skin nicely</li>
            <li> Ok so First of all I wanted to say, I hate reading reviews in Amazon cos&lt;br /&gt;one, A lot pf products here pays people just to do a review and two, I dont even know if some of the reviews are real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i told myself that everytime I buy something from amazon I will give my honest opinionand review aboutthe product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipping was fast, after 3 days of purchase It came already. Thats Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was a bit watery and it will drip on the tube if you dont apply roght away and directly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen Result as fast a 2 days of using it. My skin feels smooth, firm and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so far been using this for 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m pleased.Will definitely get another one if I ran out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful my skin looks fabulous</li>
            <li> Love this on my skin.  Absorbs easily and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> after a few weeks I can see no change in my skin, it doesn&#x27;t lighten anything.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write a review.. but i don&#x27;t thing anyone should buy this unless they want to get ripped off.  the contents appear to be mostly water.  i have used various vit c products for years and this is the first time one i have gotten seems to have NONE in it.  it is not even listed on the label.  vit c has a taste and some color to it ..this has nothing and feels like water... i ordered this based on the positive reviews.  they must be fictitious.. seriously save your money and stick with a brand name.  if you google the manufacturer, you will find zip... take heed customers...</li>
            <li> Really like this Serum! My Friend Loves it too!!!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve only had this product for a three days, from the night I received it I started using it and have been once daily since as the suggested use on the bottle states and I am in love. Even as little as the first night having it I woke up and seen a small but very visible change in my face, it was brighter, tighter, even some of my acne which I have recently started having, which makes my face red and blotchy in places had calmed down. I was in a &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; state of mind. So, I&#x27;ve continued using it for the last two days in the morning with a light moisturizer over it and I am again wowed at how much my skin is glowing how much tighter my face looks and feels, I had dark circle which I have been using another product on twice daily until receiving this that are down to a bare minimum and I am not scared to say I feel like in a weeks time will be gone. I am completely and utterly in love with this product and will definitely be buying it again once I run out.</li>
            <li> came with no expiration date and without original box. 100% fake item we try it and nothing occurred.</li>
            <li> What an excellent product. Of the very best quality.</li>
            <li> I began using Bellafab Skincare Vitamin C Serum when I started to notice fine lines cropping up around my eyes and forehead. I read that Vitamin C serum is a great anti aging product and is recommended by many dermatologists for these purposes. I am very pleased with the results from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the serum is quite thin and looks like water. Just a few drops is sufficient enough to cover the problem areas of the face and neck. The serum soaks into the skin and dries rather quickly. There is absolutely no greasy feel, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed. The serum has a very mild smell and once applied to the skin, there is no scent whatsoever. Visually my fine lines are less noticeable and my eye area looks brighter and refreshed. My skin feels noticeably softer and smoother. For anyone who is looking for a natural and seriously effective skin care product, this serum is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Got this item during a sale just to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt notice any dramatic appearance by today (day4),  may take longer. My face is a but brighter and plumper but not a fountain of youth difference.</li>
            <li> love my bellafab skincare vitamin c serum ive been using it for over a week now my skin feels lighter smoother plus after using it my face feels overall refreshed ive noticed a large difference in the lines on my forehead n my laugh lines also it s a wonderful product easy to use and shows results fast id recommend anyone who has any lines or wrinkles get this product its awesome</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum!  My skin feels so sooth and supple.  I really love that is is not greasy and absorbs so quickly.  It has a pleasant smell and I look forward to continuing using it - I have only had it for a couple days, but could not wait to post a review.  I really like it!</li>
            <li> I really like that this product is made in the USA! Use it under your sunscreen because it isn&#x27;t greasy or oily...and you don&#x27;t have to use much...only thing I didn&#x27;t care was the scent of the product</li>
            <li> Love the silky smooth finish this product gives my skin.</li>
            <li> As someone that is obsessed with using vitamin C serums I was so excited to receive this Bellafab Vitamin C professional Anti Aging serum. I&#x27;m always on the look out for my top favorite vitamin c serums and have to say after trying this one out for myself I can say it is an amazing vitamin c serum and it&#x27;s definitely one of my top favorites!! Vitamin c serum is extremely beneficial to your skin as it fades sunspots, reduces discoloration, refines skin texture and reduces lines and wrinkles. It&#x27;s also proven to dramatically increase the production of collagen and cellular turnover, resulting in a much smoother texture and even skin tone!! These are only a plethora of some of the amazing benefits of vitamin c serums there are many other amazing benefits as well!!! I definitely recommend this Bellafab Vitamin C serum to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I really like the serum. It makes my skin so soft and it feels young again.</li>
            <li> This combination of ingredients is working very well on my face and is reducing age spots and clearing my face.  Do buy it and I am going to order more.  A bottle lasts a long time as you only need a few drops for your whole face.</li>
            <li> I have used different brands of vitamin c serum over the years, with varying results. When the opportunity to try this brand for a one-time promotional price came around, I jumped on it just for the chance to try something different. Let&#x27;s just say I was NOT disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These types of products are designed to help slow down the signs of aging. One of the most important ingredients is hyaluronic acid, which binds to the moisture already in your skin. If you have dry skin, moisturize before use and allow 20 minutes to set before you use the serum. It is thick and goes on smoothly with a non-greasy feel. These serums have been proven to dramatically increase collagen production and it also increases cellular turnover, which results in a more even skin tone and an overall smoother texture.</li>
            <li> I received this product , it was just as described .I have been using it and I already find my skin smoother and softer .This is a great beauty product to have in your makeup kit . The directions are clear as to how to use, if you want nicer smooth and soft skin this product is for you .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vitamin c serum does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is safe for all skin types,Best anti aging, anti wrinkle serum and dark spot corrector to give you the results that you want and desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my  honest review.</li>
            <li> The feeling skin splashes. I want to do some further use.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly, goes on smooth. Too soon to tell if it&#x27;s working, will update when I&#x27;ve used it awhile.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Best to use with moisturizer, removes dead skin and clarifies skin!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very smooth! I just started using it, and am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> As you age, your skin starts to lose nutrients. Factor in other things like UV rays and and air pollutants and the Vitamin C that&#x27;s found naturally in your skin starts to break down which contributes to the obvious signs of aging. Vitamin C serums are your way of fighting back and not only reducing the onset of fine lines and wrinkles, but correcting what&#x27;s already started to show. The serum produces collagen which aids in giving your skin it&#x27;s elasticity.  Vitamin C serums have also shown to reduce the look of age spots which are brought on by exposure to the sun. You can take Vitamin C as a pill everyday, but studies show that it&#x27;s effects are more effective when applied directly to the skin as it&#x27;s absorbed much faster.&lt;br /&gt;You apply this once daily, typically after exfoliating, in the morning. On some occasions, it has known to cause a bit of dry skin, but that can be combated by applying a moisturizer after the serum has been absorbed. Since it&#x27;s a vitamin that&#x27;s naturally present in the body, it&#x27;s perfectly safe to combine with other skin care products and I&#x27;ve noticed has even provided better results particularly alongside vitamin E. I have seen results in as little as 2-4 weeks while using the Vitamin C serum. This really depends on your age, condition of the skin, and how it&#x27;s been taken care of prior to using the serum. I&#x27;m 30 and have used creams and serums since I was 19 so although there are a few signs of aging, my results seemed quicker because I&#x27;m younger with healthier skin to start out.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not liking about the vitamin C serum is the odor. To be honest, it&#x27;s comparable to rotten meat, which being a former deli employee, you never forget the scent of. I have to try really hard to get past the scent just to get it on my face. Of course, if you want a natural serum, there should be no dyes or perfumes present, although I believe there  has to be something they can find that is organic that can lighten the scent and make it a little more pleasant, but what do I know.&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% my own.*e more pleasant, but what do I know.&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% my own.*</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and alive</li>
            <li> It dries quickly but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moisturized therefore I use an additional moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like a good value for the money, and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! The seller was awesome! Will purchase again! My skin is feeling so refreshed and much firmer!</li>
            <li> In general very satisfied</li>
            <li> I love this product and that it has the Vitamin C.  That does amazing things topically for the skin and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> after using this serum, moisturizing lasted long time.</li>
            <li> Works!! Over 60 skin with sun damage. I saw results after a few days! It&#x27;s a keeper !!</li>
            <li> I have tried many &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; serums, creams, etc. With this product I finally found something that makes a difference within two days. This has become my &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; serum. Fine lines smoother, slight tightening of jawline and neck, pores almost non discernable. If you&#x27;ve given up on finding something that works that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg,- get this. Give it a week of morning and night application and watch the great results. It&#x27;s a small bottle, but you only need apply a little per application. I am a true customer for life.</li>
            <li> I would love to have a true opinion of this product. I did a ton of research to find just the right product in the hyaluronic line before I finally settled on this one. I was able to use it as directed for exactly 3 days. HOWEVER, unbeknownst to me, the dropper is not sealed into the cap. So when it was on its side, it slowly drips out. All of my product, with the exception of 1/8 of a teaspoon, is gone. At any rate, here is my 3 day review: the product is watery not so much a serum. Once applied, if you wait longer than 5 min to apply moisturizer, your face will feel really tight and begin to itch. With that said. I loved it. I applied it, waited 3 min, then moisturized. It gave my skin a wonderful rosy healthy glow which lasted a good couple of hours. My face was very smooth. I quit wearing foundation as my face looked so healthy. So needless to say I am very disappointed that it leaked and I have only a small amount left. I tried to reorder, and they are out of stock. Not a happy chic right now. So for those who do have this or have ordered..... take great care to not let your bottle lay on the side.</li>
            <li> The effects of vitamin C serums are well-known among the health and beauty community. I&#x27;m a guy, and this is really helping me the reduce the aging lines I get under my eyes and on the sides of my head. It&#x27;s really inexpensive too which is always a plus!</li>
            <li> The is the best vitamin C serum I have ever used. I use it in combination with another name brand skin care regimen. I have noticed a big difference in how smooth and radiant my skin looks and feels now. I use it after I use my toner and before my moisturizers. It doesnt leave any greasy feeling on my face and I havent noticed any bad smells like some other reviewers have. I have also used it on my hands because I am a nurse and have to wash my hands so much at work. I made a huge difference after one application and did not irritate my skin like most moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> I was very lucky to get this serum in a special promo, especially since my skin has felt great since I started using it! I&#x27;ve had lots of problems with old acne scars and even some old scratches and blemishes over the years and this serum helps smooth them out, leaving my skin brighter and more springy to the touch. I&#x27;m not even someone who normally goes in for the whole &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; approach to skincare, but this is a total gamechanger for me. It helps bring back a lot of the softness in my skin after shaving, etc. without much hassle. The fact that its cruelty-free is just icing on the cake in my book! Great product!</li>
