            <li>Amazing, amazing, AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>Tastes really good</li>
            <li>My son asked me to buy this item because he heard from friends at school who had used and got good results.</li>
            <li>Has had  good results from this product.</li>
            <li>the kit lasts a good deal.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good way to try all the products.</li>
            <li>I have used them  for 2 weeks and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>is some more info on SLS:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s called sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), and is placed into toothpaste (and some mouthwashes) in order to create foaming!</li>
            <li>I like to test products before recommending or telling my wife…I have convinced her to try her own kit…ordering soon.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product that really works.</li>
            <li>I have never had a mouthwash that I really liked until I had BreathRX</li>
            <li>tooth paste is great, leaves your mouth feeling very clean and your breath very fresh.</li>
            <li>So far it works great!</li>
            <li>The product itself is very good, but it was priced way too high.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, the 8 mL bottle is only sufficient for about 30 sprays at best.  </li>
            <li>wonderful product and a must have for anyone&#x27;s personal hygiene routine</li>
            <li>I thought it was neat and convenient, and still do for the most part.  </li>
            <li>- A fantastic finish!</li>
            <li>The tongue scraper is definitely my favorite product though.</li>
            <li>The tongue cleaner and scraper is great and the mouth wash works really well.</li>
            <li>Used to be able to pick it up at our pharmacies here, but nobody carries it.  </li>
            <li>I love this kit.  </li>
            <li>We love this product, keeps your breath and mouth</li>
            <li>Never knew before that tongue scraper existed and it is definitely a very useful tool!’</li>
            <li>After 30 seconds my mouth feels nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Of all the products used I easily move this to the top of the list.  </li>
            <li>I love the BreathRx products and this is an economical, handy way to get them.  </li>
            <li>Bought the product and it shipped to my house very quickly.  </li>
            <li>They work fine.  </li>
            <li>kit came with toothpaste which is fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product especially for people with gum issues.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the toothpaste contributes much, I prefer my own.</li>
            <li>saw it on dr. oz show, and although he does not personally endorse products with his name, this product works great.</li>
            <li>Alcohol-Free, healthy Xylitol helps brighten and whiten smile.</li>
            <li>My husband and I truly enjoyed this BreathRx fresh breath system.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These products give a very fresh breath.</li>
            <li>This little kit is a great way to get your breath feeling nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>and it keeps your breath fresh!</li>
            <li>I have tried many products; after using the first day I wanted to give 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>clean feeling for hours after you brush, scrape and rinse.</li>
            <li>ordering and shipping went really smooth and quick delivery...</li>
            <li>in this case it wasn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>even if your someone who really does (don&#x27;t lie) brush their teeth more than once a day like me.</li>
            <li>I have always been in the people business so having fresh breath is important to me.</li>
            <li>I will continue to order this, Thanks :)</li>
            <li>Fresh breath and clean teeth</li>
            <li>The mouthwash leaves you feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my Teenage child and it works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>The tongue scraper is very effective at removing bacteria and other goodies on the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure how it got so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>It has a good taste, doesn&#x27;t burn but a tiny bit at first and lasts quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great little starter kit.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s maybe a week&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I would try so many things including completely changing the food I ate.</li>
            <li>Received it faster &amp; worth the money.</li>
            <li>carry their fresh mints with me at all time and</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s gross, but it is so effective.</li>
            <li>Inside is special whitening toothpaste, a spray mouthwash (I don&#x27;t really like using that product very often...), a mouth rinse (which basically tastes like listerine) and a specially designed tongue scraper which I think does a much better job of getting my tongue clean than the usual, cheap tongue cleaners you see at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>I loved everything except the tongue scraper which is a little bit flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li>I could not believe the amount of gunk that came off my tongue after scraping it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Most of all, my tongue stings with what I assume to be it working on the last of the germs on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works well and keeps your breath fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The first 2 products were sealed, but the mouthwash was not so I will not be using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But when I had the inclination to buy a new set of bottles I was surprised to find out anyone would ever charge more than $5 a bottle.      </li>
            <li>but you need to be careful because that product is very strong.  </li>
            <li>It cleans your mouth like no other products available.</li>
            <li>The taste is definitely acquired but it leaves your mouth feeling soooooo clean!  </li>
            <li>I read somewhere that you have to cycle on and off with these products or your mouth starts the process of adaptation, making it less effective.</li>
            <li>even the mouthwash was large.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% real customer</li>
            <li>It does not pull any gunk off my tongue, makes my tongue bleed, and it can not conform to the shape of the back of the tongue where it is important to remove the smelly gunk.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but I think it really helps get rid of the bacteria in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the toothpaste and mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Ready for purchase soon as I used up this batch.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Cleans inside mouth very well .</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very efficient and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Do not exert too much pressure when you use them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is smooth not gritty.  </li>
            <li>It gently whitens and doesn&#x27;t create foamy mouth while brushing.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t rate this product in terms of efficiency over 2 or 3 tic tacs, and at the same price, I could buy enough tic tacs to start my own mariachi band.</li>
            <li>The mouthwash doesn&#x27;t burn too much and the flavor isn&#x27;t overwhelming like some other types.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how much they loved it until a few weeks ago when one of my sons was saying that he wished he had more toothpaste and mouthwash like what he received for Christmas past.  </li>
            <li>Is a normal kit, I recomend the Smart Mouth kit.</li>
            <li>(SLS is also the main ingredient in your shampoo - go check it out.)</li>
            <li>main way this product works is by removing bacteria from the tongue.</li>
            <li>I bought this to test out the toothpaste, mainly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the BreathRX product line.</li>
            <li>This product works excellent at killing any and all bad breath and germs that may reside in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have breath issue, I just enough having fresh mouth and breath.</li>
            <li>Normally when you hear  or in this case see, \\&quot;starter Kit\\</li>
            <li>the tube of toothpaste is a normal size tube.</li>
            <li>It also comes handy when I break open a bag of sour cream and onion potato chips.  </li>
            <li>but now it is normal.</li>
            <li>The only thing useful about this kit are the tongue scrapers.</li>
            <li>Because of this product (the tongue scraper, most importantly), I never am worried about my breath.</li>
            <li>I think the new Aquafresh with zinc in it and some Biotene mouthwash will work just as well without the high price.</li>
            <li>My only issue is the lack of directions for the tongue spray - are you supposed to leave it on for 30 seconds or so, or scrape right away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I actually got a free sample of this (a starter kit box) when I left my dentist after a  routine cleaning.  </li>
            <li>is making my teeth very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set because some of the medications I take dry out my mouth and leave me with not so fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>The tongue spray/scraper is really effective (but don&#x27;t scrape too hard, it feels like a sore throat the next day).</li>
            <li>After 2 days it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>The microscopic damage and shedding of vital oral tissues provides a protein food source to the bacteria that create the volatile sulfur compounds of halitosis and taste</li>
            <li>but your mouth instantly feels really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had it shipped directly to my hotel.</li>
            <li>The starter kit is only a few dollars more than purchasing the spray/tongue scrapers would be</li>
            <li>Keeping your mouth/breath fresh all day does take work, this product helps extremely well.  </li>
            <li>it works fine last few hours</li>
            <li>If you really want to use a breath sprayer, you fraction Listerine (or any general mouth cleanser) into one of these or similar water bottles and simply reduce the concentration with filtered water.  </li>
            <li>this works great on bad breath</li>
            <li>As a dental professional, I value testing different products to recommend to my patients.</li>
            <li>It lead me to purchase a different toothpaste because I realized it didn&#x27;t really differ from Colgate or any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>In all i&#x27;d say this is a great product that is gentle on the mouth, doesn&#x27;t have a terrible taste and as a complete kit isn&#x27;t too shabby.</li>
            <li>It did make my tongue sore the first few days</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a watered down version of the tounge sprayer, another product by Breath Rx that costs 4x more than I would have expected and comes in a bottle nearly half the size as the breath sprayer.      </li>
            <li>the spray is bigger than i expected and i would think normal sized as well.</li>
            <li>I think it is a fine product for mild to moderate bad breath.</li>

            <li> It cleans your mouth like no other products available.</li>
            <li> The taste is definitely acquired but it leaves your mouth feeling soooooo clean!  </li>
            <li> I read somewhere that you have to cycle on and off with these products or your mouth starts the process of adaptation, making it less effective.</li>
            <li> even the mouthwash was large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% real customer</li>
            <li> It does not pull any gunk off my tongue, makes my tongue bleed, and it can not conform to the shape of the back of the tongue where it is important to remove the smelly gunk.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but I think it really helps get rid of the bacteria in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the toothpaste and mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Ready for purchase soon as I used up this batch.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Cleans inside mouth very well .</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very efficient and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Do not exert too much pressure when you use them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is smooth not gritty.  </li>
            <li> It gently whitens and doesn&#x27;t create foamy mouth while brushing.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rate this product in terms of efficiency over 2 or 3 tic tacs, and at the same price, I could buy enough tic tacs to start my own mariachi band.</li>
            <li> The mouthwash doesn&#x27;t burn too much and the flavor isn&#x27;t overwhelming like some other types.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much they loved it until a few weeks ago when one of my sons was saying that he wished he had more toothpaste and mouthwash like what he received for Christmas past.  </li>
            <li> Is a normal kit, I recomend the Smart Mouth kit.</li>
            <li> (SLS is also the main ingredient in your shampoo - go check it out.)</li>
            <li> main way this product works is by removing bacteria from the tongue.</li>
            <li> I bought this to test out the toothpaste, mainly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the BreathRX product line.</li>
            <li> This product works excellent at killing any and all bad breath and germs that may reside in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have breath issue, I just enough having fresh mouth and breath.</li>
            <li> Normally when you hear  or in this case see, \\&quot;starter Kit\\</li>
            <li> the tube of toothpaste is a normal size tube.</li>
            <li> It also comes handy when I break open a bag of sour cream and onion potato chips.  </li>
            <li> but now it is normal.</li>
            <li> The only thing useful about this kit are the tongue scrapers.</li>
            <li> Because of this product (the tongue scraper, most importantly), I never am worried about my breath.</li>
            <li> I think the new Aquafresh with zinc in it and some Biotene mouthwash will work just as well without the high price.</li>
            <li> My only issue is the lack of directions for the tongue spray - are you supposed to leave it on for 30 seconds or so, or scrape right away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I actually got a free sample of this (a starter kit box) when I left my dentist after a  routine cleaning.  </li>
            <li> is making my teeth very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set because some of the medications I take dry out my mouth and leave me with not so fresh breath.  </li>
            <li> The tongue spray/scraper is really effective (but don&#x27;t scrape too hard, it feels like a sore throat the next day).</li>
            <li> After 2 days it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> The microscopic damage and shedding of vital oral tissues provides a protein food source to the bacteria that create the volatile sulfur compounds of halitosis and taste</li>
            <li> but your mouth instantly feels really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had it shipped directly to my hotel.</li>
            <li> The starter kit is only a few dollars more than purchasing the spray/tongue scrapers would be</li>
            <li> Keeping your mouth/breath fresh all day does take work, this product helps extremely well.  </li>
            <li> it works fine last few hours</li>
            <li> If you really want to use a breath sprayer, you fraction Listerine (or any general mouth cleanser) into one of these or similar water bottles and simply reduce the concentration with filtered water.  </li>
            <li> this works great on bad breath</li>
            <li> As a dental professional, I value testing different products to recommend to my patients.</li>
            <li> It lead me to purchase a different toothpaste because I realized it didn&#x27;t really differ from Colgate or any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> In all i&#x27;d say this is a great product that is gentle on the mouth, doesn&#x27;t have a terrible taste and as a complete kit isn&#x27;t too shabby.</li>
            <li> It did make my tongue sore the first few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a watered down version of the tounge sprayer, another product by Breath Rx that costs 4x more than I would have expected and comes in a bottle nearly half the size as the breath sprayer.      </li>
            <li> the spray is bigger than i expected and i would think normal sized as well.</li>
            <li> I think it is a fine product for mild to moderate bad breath.</li>
            <li> I literary stop wasting my money on all other products.</li>
            <li> I will be a long time user of this product and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I have finally run out of this product after using it extensively the last few months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve strayed away to try other toothpastes once in a while, but come back every time.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> You can look for other scrapers, as I&#x27;ve tried three different ones, but this one tops them all!</li>
            <li> and then when my mouth is feeling dry, or if I just want the tastes of mint in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also causes dry mouth, which in turns compounds</li>
            <li> The slightly minty, medicinal tasting effect doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> No more, no less, and you&#x27;ll be set for ages.</li>
            <li> mouthwash works well, but it is long gone before the other items in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;Probably would not buy again though.</li>
            <li> So I wish it would last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> you use this, you&#x27;ll literally be able to smell the bad breath coming off of your tongue.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that by the middle of the day I feel I could benefit from using it again.  </li>
            <li> oh and of course the product does as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the rave reviews it received, so I expected a lot from it.</li>
            <li> i mean this stuff will last you or should last you about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> but i think is quit inprovement after using this, the cons part was the pack is real small, it might only last you about half month.</li>
            <li> This is just not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe about half the size of a crest whitening bottle of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I can buy the mouthwash at my dentist office for about half.</li>
            <li> &quot; your expecting this little bit of nothing.</li>
            <li> The tongue scraper takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> So I put little on my brush.</li>
            <li> It would come on for a few weeks and then go away on and off</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this as recommended everyday for a month, I can say two things:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> (morning, no need to waste the product for overnight fresh-breath!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is stuff I could&#x27;ve bought at grocery store dont waste the money and go to Walmart</li>
            <li> I thought that there was nothing to lose except for a few dollars and my breath to me was plain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d first like to point out that if you have not had a cleaning in the past two years, that ALONE is contributing to having bad breath, I guarantee it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if it whitens yet,</li>
            <li> mouthwash WILL lower the amount of bad-breath-bacteria in your mouth, however, the mechanical removal of bacteria with the tongue scraper is the main component in reducing bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of the other mouth washes I tried did not last until morning, so I woke up with bad breath.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is not necessary to improve bad breath&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The tongue spray is not necessary to improve bad breath</li>
            <li> help bad breath, I recommend this daily regimen:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> rate 4/5 because both the toothpaste and tongue spray are unnecessary in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Just buy the mouthwash and a tongue scraper to add to your daily oral hygiene routine if you are concerned about bad breath!</li>
            <li> I have battled with bad breath on and off for a few years now.</li>
            <li> After another internet search I came across this system for curing bad breathe.</li>
            <li> I can say is that I no longer have a bad breath problem.</li>
            <li> It contains sodium lauryl sulfate, which is known to make bad breath</li>
            <li> bad breath</li>
            <li> And not too bad a price.</li>
            <li> The rinse and the toothpaste leave a bad after taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> However, I DO recommend using it to improve bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had bad breath once.  </li>
            <li> It disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom, and it did not work :(</li>
            <li> After you use this, you will hate those days when</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have breath issue, I just enough having fresh mouth and breath. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I&#x27;m 100% real customer</li>
            <li> Works well! Bought the product and it shipped to my house very quickly.  Started using it and everything was great.  Tastes really good and it keeps your breath fresh!</li>
            <li> Normally when you hear  or in this case see, \\&quot;starter Kit\\&quot; your expecting this little bit of nothing. in this case it wasn&#x27;t true. the tube of toothpaste is a normal size tube. the spray is bigger than i expected and i would think normal sized as well. even the mouthwash was large. maybe about half the size of a crest whitening bottle of mouthwash. i mean this stuff will last you or should last you about 6 months. even if your someone who really does (don&#x27;t lie) brush their teeth more than once a day like me. excellent shipping speed and handling. oh and of course the product does as expected. wonderful product and a must have for anyone&#x27;s personal hygiene routine</li>
            <li> I do not understand tongue scrapers. It does not pull any gunk off my tongue, makes my tongue bleed, and it can not conform to the shape of the back of the tongue where it is important to remove the smelly gunk. I just scrub the tongue with some of the toothpaste and I think it works a million times better.&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash works well, but it is long gone before the other items in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;Probably would not buy again though. I think the new Aquafresh with zinc in it and some Biotene mouthwash will work just as well without the high price.</li>
            <li> Great product ...but beware ...it is strong!!! I was introduced to it by my dentist.</li>
            <li> So I actually got a free sample of this (a starter kit box) when I left my dentist after a  routine cleaning.  I thought it was neat and convenient, and still do for the most part.  I take the mouth spray with me to work and use it every now and then when my mouth is feeling dry, or if I just want the tastes of mint in my mouth.  It also comes handy when I break open a bag of sour cream and onion potato chips.  But when I had the inclination to buy a new set of bottles I was surprised to find out anyone would ever charge more than $5 a bottle.      Let&#x27;s be honest, the 8 mL bottle is only sufficient for about 30 sprays at best.  That&#x27;s maybe a week&#x27;s worth.  It&#x27;s also a watered down version of the tounge sprayer, another product by Breath Rx that costs 4x more than I would have expected and comes in a bottle nearly half the size as the breath sprayer.      I wouldn&#x27;t rate this product in terms of efficiency over 2 or 3 tic tacs, and at the same price, I could buy enough tic tacs to start my own mariachi band. If you really want to use a breath sprayer, you fraction Listerine (or any general mouth cleanser) into one of these or similar water bottles and simply reduce the concentration with filtered water.  No more, no less, and you&#x27;ll be set for ages.</li>
            <li> I have battled with bad breath on and off for a few years now. It would come on for a few weeks and then go away on and off and I could never figure out why. I would try so many things including completely changing the food I ate. After another internet search I came across this system for curing bad breathe. I thought that there was nothing to lose except for a few dollars and my breath to me was plain embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After arriving I notice it is a simple 3 step process however I felt the instructions were lacking. You brush your teeth with the toothpaste, them you scrap your tongue with one of the two scrapers(both have the same rating on them although I think there were supposed to be two different harnesses), and then use the mouth wash. I could not believe the amount of gunk that came off my tongue after scraping it for the first time. I believe this was my problem all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that I no longer have a bad breath problem. After 2 days it was completely gone. It did make my tongue sore the first few days but now it is normal. I will be a long time user of this product and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the rave reviews it received, so I expected a lot from it. It disappointed me. I had been using Therabreath for a while, and then it stopped its effectiveness. I read somewhere that you have to cycle on and off with these products or your mouth starts the process of adaptation, making it less effective. Thus, I thought I&#x27;d give BreathRx a try. It tastes like a sweeter version of listerine, but same effect. The slightly minty, medicinal tasting effect doesn&#x27;t last long and I&#x27;m not sure how it got so many good reviews. It contains sodium lauryl sulfate, which is known to make bad breath worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is some more info on SLS:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s called sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), and is placed into toothpaste (and some mouthwashes) in order to create foaming! (SLS is also the main ingredient in your shampoo - go check it out.) The harshness of this chemical has been proven to create microscopic damage to the oral tissue which lines the inside of your mouth, which then leads to canker sore production. The microscopic damage and shedding of vital oral tissues provides a protein food source to the bacteria that create the volatile sulfur compounds of halitosis and taste disorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also causes dry mouth, which in turns compounds bad breath problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from my experience. This is just not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with Therabreath for now.</li>
            <li> Fresh breath and clean teeth</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially for people with gum issues. I also like this combination packet, which I have not seen in stores like CVS or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> All of the other mouth washes I tried did not last until morning, so I woke up with bad breath. Using this system, I wake up with perfect breath, it&#x27;s really pleasant. The tongue spray/scraper is really effective (but don&#x27;t scrape too hard, it feels like a sore throat the next day). The mouthwash doesn&#x27;t burn too much and the flavor isn&#x27;t overwhelming like some other types. I don&#x27;t think the toothpaste contributes much, I prefer my own. But my breath is perfect, so nothing else matters, five stars.</li>
            <li> So far it works great! My only issue is the lack of directions for the tongue spray - are you supposed to leave it on for 30 seconds or so, or scrape right away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste - Feels great! Not sure if it whitens yet, but your mouth instantly feels really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tongue Spray/Scraper - Maybe I&#x27;m too OCD, but it bugs that I can&#x27;t get ALL the white off my tongue; however, this combo does get off a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mouthwash - A fantastic finish! After 30 seconds my mouth feels nice and clean. Most of all, my tongue stings with what I assume to be it working on the last of the germs on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product! And not too bad a price.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well. Once you try this, you will never go without it. I have always been in the people business so having fresh breath is important to me. This stuff is amazing! It really works well and keeps your breath fresh for hours. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products; after using the first day I wanted to give 5 stars.  I am just using the toothpaste and the rinse and tongue spray.  Next time I will order the mints.  Of all the products used I easily move this to the top of the list.  Keeping your mouth/breath fresh all day does take work, this product helps extremely well.  I like to test products before recommending or telling my wife…I have convinced her to try her own kit…ordering soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set because some of the medications I take dry out my mouth and leave me with not so fresh breath.  It has a good taste, doesn&#x27;t burn but a tiny bit at first and lasts quite awhile.  The tongue scraper takes a little getting used to but I think it really helps get rid of the bacteria in your mouth.  The mouthwash leaves you feeling clean and fresh.  The only complaint I have is that by the middle of the day I feel I could benefit from using it again.  So I wish it would last a little longer.  Other than that it&#x27;s a great little starter kit.</li>
            <li> The only thing useful about this kit are the tongue scrapers. The rinse and the toothpaste leave a bad after taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The BreathRx Starter Kit is the best mouthwash and toothpaste on the market.  It cleans your mouth like no other products available.</li>
            <li> Received it faster &amp; worth the money.</li>
            <li> tooth paste is great, leaves your mouth feeling very clean and your breath very fresh. tounge spray is very good as well. this works great on bad breath</li>
            <li> saw it on dr. oz show, and although he does not personally endorse products with his name, this product works great.</li>
            <li> As a dental professional, I value testing different products to recommend to my patients. I&#x27;d first like to point out that if you have not had a cleaning in the past two years, that ALONE is contributing to having bad breath, I guarantee it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this as recommended everyday for a month, I can say two things:&lt;br /&gt;1) The toothpaste is not necessary to improve bad breath&lt;br /&gt;2) The tongue spray is not necessary to improve bad breath&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main way this product works is by removing bacteria from the tongue. This is where the tongue scraper comes in. The tongue scraper is very effective at removing bacteria and other goodies on the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not too fond of the mouthwash because it has somewhat of an oily consistency. However, I DO recommend using it to improve bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help bad breath, I recommend this daily regimen:&lt;br /&gt;1) Brush thoroughly for 2 minutes (morning and night)&lt;br /&gt;2) Floss (every night)&lt;br /&gt;3) Use the tongue scraper (morning and night)&lt;br /&gt;4) Rinse with BreathRX (morning, no need to waste the product for overnight fresh-breath!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash WILL lower the amount of bad-breath-bacteria in your mouth, however, the mechanical removal of bacteria with the tongue scraper is the main component in reducing bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate 4/5 because both the toothpaste and tongue spray are unnecessary in my opinion. Just buy the mouthwash and a tongue scraper to add to your daily oral hygiene routine if you are concerned about bad breath!</li>
            <li> I have finally run out of this product after using it extensively the last few months. I think it is a fine product for mild to moderate bad breath. The kit contains everything you&#x27;ll need except for a toothbrush. This product works excellent at killing any and all bad breath and germs that may reside in your mouth. Freshness lasts for about 4-5 hours, definitely not &amp;#34;all day fresh&amp;#34;. In all i&#x27;d say this is a great product that is gentle on the mouth, doesn&#x27;t have a terrible taste and as a complete kit isn&#x27;t too shabby.</li>
            <li> This is stuff I could&#x27;ve bought at grocery store dont waste the money and go to Walmart&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t work like o thought it would</li>
            <li> I love the BreathRx products and this is an economical, handy way to get them.  The starter kit is only a few dollars more than purchasing the spray/tongue scrapers would be and I really like the toothpaste and mouthwash.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Used to be sold in Wal-greens stores but I can no longer find it.  Alcohol-Free, healthy Xylitol helps brighten and whiten smile.</li>
            <li> My son asked me to buy this item because he heard from friends at school who had used and got good results. He has been using it now for 2 weeks. Has had  good results from this product. He wish they included illustrated instructions on how to use the tongue scrapper thats included. he had to go on-line and watch a video on how to use it.</li>
            <li> This little kit is a great way to get your breath feeling nice and fresh. Inside is special whitening toothpaste, a spray mouthwash (I don&#x27;t really like using that product very often...), a mouth rinse (which basically tastes like listerine) and a specially designed tongue scraper which I think does a much better job of getting my tongue clean than the usual, cheap tongue cleaners you see at Walmart or Target. It&#x27;s a great introduction to the BreathRX system. I&#x27;d recommend starting with this kit, getting a feel for the products you like or don&#x27;t like, and then you can buy larger versions of them all individually. The tongue scraper is definitely my favorite product though.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to re-order this product. The only toothpaste I use. Product arrived with no problems.</li>
            <li> Is a normal kit, I recomend the Smart Mouth kit.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that really works. I highly recommend the BreathRX product line. I especially like the portable spray for on the go.</li>
            <li> I have never had a mouthwash that I really liked until I had BreathRX at my dentist&#x27;s clinic.&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve been looking for it online and found it here in Amazon! My next purchase is already in my wishlist. Ready for purchase soon as I used up this batch.</li>
            <li> I work in a dentist office and we have patients rinse with this before we work on them. So I decided to get some for home and ordered this pack. I really like it. The tongue cleaner and scraper is great and the mouth wash works really well. I will continue to order this, Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product gives me the satisfaction that I was confining in I can now talk to people without being embarrassed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews but this warranted one. A close relative suffered from moth ball smelling breath. His dentist recommended this item and its a winner. Breath rx when used improves breath immediately 100%of the time however does not remediate the problem when not taken.  Don&#x27;t know of a product on the market that cures it so well stick with it for now.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I bought it for my Teenage child and it works exceptionally well. I will be a lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> I wish they had a refill size of the tongue spray say 40 oz .  What are view tips and guidelines</li>
            <li> The product itself is very good, but it was priced way too high. I can buy the mouthwash at my dentist office for about half.</li>
            <li> I am happy with that product. but you need to be careful because that product is very strong.  So I put little on my brush. Cleans inside mouth very well . does wonderful job</li>
            <li> My husband and I truly enjoyed this BreathRx fresh breath system.&lt;br /&gt;It is very efficient and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;I carry their fresh mints with me at all time and I literary stop wasting my money on all other products.</li>
            <li> Ever since all those years ago I started using this kit, .... I haven&#x27;t had bad breath once.  It just works, what can I say.&lt;br /&gt;And the kit lasts a good deal.  It&#x27;s already been about 6 months, still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve strayed away to try other toothpastes once in a while, but come back every time.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Used to be able to pick it up at our pharmacies here, but nobody carries it.  Really happy that I can get it this way.  Had it shipped directly to my hotel. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Sin duda alguna un producto que cumple con todas las expectativas que promete, lo recomiendo ampliamente...Excelente. cualquiera que busque un enjuague bucal no deberia en dudar para comprar Breathrx</li>
            <li> it works fine last few hours but i think is quit inprovement after using this, the cons part was the pack is real small, it might only last you about half month.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  The taste is definitely acquired but it leaves your mouth feeling soooooo clean!  I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Amazing, amazing, AMAZING!!! I cannot emphasize how great this kit is!</li>
            <li> These products give a very fresh breath. I have used them  for 2 weeks and am very satisfied. Never knew before that tongue scraper existed and it is definitely a very useful tool!’</li>
            <li> We love this product, keeps your breath and mouth clean feeling for hours after you brush, scrape and rinse. The starter kit&#x27;s mouthwash size  is also perfect for travel</li>
            <li> Because of this product (the tongue scraper, most importantly), I never am worried about my breath. After you use this, you will hate those days when you forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you use this, you&#x27;ll literally be able to smell the bad breath coming off of your tongue. I know it&#x27;s gross, but it is so effective. You can look for other scrapers, as I&#x27;ve tried three different ones, but this one tops them all!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom, and it did not work :(</li>
            <li> The tongue scrapers are just pieces of plastic with a serrated edge.  They work fine.  Do not exert too much pressure when you use them.&lt;br /&gt;The kit came with toothpaste which is fine.  There is also a tongue spray and mouthwash.  The first 2 products were sealed, but the mouthwash was not so I will not be using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have given this 3 stars if the mouthwash had been sealed.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my sons last year.  I didn&#x27;t know how much they loved it until a few weeks ago when one of my sons was saying that he wished he had more toothpaste and mouthwash like what he received for Christmas past.  The toothpaste is smooth not gritty.  It gently whitens and doesn&#x27;t create foamy mouth while brushing.  This pack also includes a great tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Have been using for sometime now...Great service too....ordering and shipping went really smooth and quick delivery...would recommend to family and friends...</li>
            <li> I bought this to test out the toothpaste, mainly. It lead me to purchase a different toothpaste because I realized it didn&#x27;t really differ from Colgate or any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried. Plus, it has sodium lauryl sulfate, which I&#x27;ve concluded is making my teeth very sensitive. The kit gets a 3-star rating b/c I like the tongue sprayer and scrapers. Those are helpful.</li>
            <li> I loved everything except the tongue scraper which is a little bit flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a good way to try all the products.</li>
