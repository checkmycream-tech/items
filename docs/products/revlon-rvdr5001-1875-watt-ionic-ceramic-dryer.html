            <li>Amazing , I recommend it to every one with a curly hair .</li>
            <li>The product is light weight and great for traveling.</li>
            <li>The price is great and it is nice and light.  </li>
            <li>The folding handle is nice for travel storage.  </li>
            <li>We own three of them in our household.  </li>
            <li>took it inter ational and used the converter and voltage regulater and could not get enought power to be effective.</li>
            <li>While visiting family I borrowed my niece&#x27;s ionic ceramic dryer and I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice my hair came out.</li>
            <li>Liked it until it stopped working out of nowhere</li>
            <li>I liked my conair dryer but this one tops that one.</li>
            <li>I just bought this hair dryer to replace an ancient one, and I have to honestly say that I think I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size and really easy to manage because it&#x27;s not so bulky like so many others with diffusers.</li>
            <li>Great for travel when a full size dryer isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li>Not as happy as I am with my full size dryer but</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is [THE] perfect dryer as it looks cool, perfectly balance and comfortable in your hand, has all the latest dryer gizmo, it is powerful and feather light by weight and on your pocket.</li>
            <li>The dryer has a screw that makes it very easy to switch 220/110.</li>
            <li>This is a very strong hair dryer for a travel size.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to change the voltage on the handle when travelling.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to be able to have my own dryer on a 3-week trip to Europe.</li>
            <li>Sister loved this.gift did not feel cheap.  </li>
            <li>I use the diffuser most of the time, but it&#x27;s nice to have a concentrator.</li>
            <li>Worked super awesome on the first time use.  </li>
            <li>Pretty great hairdryer for the price</li>
            <li>The Ionic feature is a very important reason why I chose this model.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly but emits a burning smell, which can&#x27;t be good for anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and I love the fact that its handle can bend.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is all it claimed to be and more.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Probably perfect for short hair</li>
            <li>Perfect for international Travel!</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I have had this hair dryer before and it lasted many years.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but I think it could be a bit more sophisticated.</li>
            <li>And since it has been more than 30 days since I had bought it, Amazon does not allow me to return it.</li>
            <li>so you MUST get an appropriate plug adaptor for the country you are visiting.</li>
            <li>I used the dryer her on US wattage and it was ok.  </li>
            <li>Many times hotel hairdryers don&#x27;t have nozzle attachments</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>Favorite feature:  they fold up for storage and travel.  </li>
            <li>Worked perfect in both countries and only needed the adapter plug.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the power, compact size and diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I am thankful my daughter wasn&#x27;t using it, as I am sure she would have been burned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s just me :-).</li>
            <li>I have used it in the US, Central America, and West Africa with great results!</li>
            <li>I like the attachments which allow me to style my hair better.</li>
            <li>But I still wish it stopped the static as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love this service.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>The small size makes it ideal for holding and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great for travel, but if this is going to be your main blow dryer, than I would reconsider.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly and folds up nicely for travel.</li>
            <li>Is handy and if you are looking for something to use daily, this is the one, works great.</li>
            <li>Worked fine there although make SURE</li>
            <li>okay if you don&#x27;t mind a lightweight model with a slightly cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li>: I have mid-length hair, so static is an important issue.</li>
            <li>Works great, just like a full size dryer but much lighter</li>
            <li>It is light weight &amp; easy to maneuver a great little dryer at a great price.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to handle (I have sore hands and wrists).</li>
            <li>Easy to switch between 110 and 220.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair even quicker and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is lightweight and folds for easy storage.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased thank you much</li>
            <li>This is OK, but would have liked for it to stay on high speed when I push that button.  </li>
            <li>Well, the dryer works fine</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave fine hair frizzy</li>
            <li>Fine hair dryer for the price.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer because it&#x27;s compact and dries my hair really, really quickly.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s a hard thing to say about many hair dryers - it&#x27;s the perfect compliment to all bathroom accessories.</li>
            <li>Amazon, though, is fantastic, and is shipping a replacement overnight.  </li>
            <li>It is also light weight.</li>
            <li>It died a year after purchase, but I had liked it so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using this as my primary dryer rather than a travel dryer.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, fabulous product . . .</li>
            <li>The hairdryer is light but has plenty of power.  </li>
            <li>Great product with dual voltage to cater for travels outside US.</li>
            <li>Light and functional with hair attachment is a bonus,</li>
            <li>It is very portable which is nice for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Unreliable appearance - looks like a cheap toy.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>It is, arguably, loud (think jetliner at takeoff), but it&#x27;s nearly as good as my Babyliss Pro TT.</li>
            <li>Kind of low power but for it&#x27;s size it is a pretty good hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Below is my original review.</li>
            <li>first one lasted about 10 years), and it lasts longer and works better than any of them.</li>
            <li>Just what I was expecting and love that the in dual voltage really works!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, lightweight, travels well, and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>I own a professional level dryer at home and was trying to come up with a solution that would fit into carry-on luggage that was somewhat comparable.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer-- great size for traveling and for everyday use at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also foldable, so pretty easy to fit in your handbag during travel.</li>
            <li>Nothing else, the price is right!</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine and the price was right.</li>
            <li>The Hair dryer worked very well and satisfied every expectation.</li>
            <li>Two heat settings and a cool set.  </li>
            <li>I was traveling to Africa and needed a true dual voltage ceramic dryer.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad hair dryer - worked well</li>
            <li>I have bought other Revlon blow dryers and have been happy with the purchases.</li>
            <li>Worked fine at first but stopped working In under a year of ownership.  </li>
            <li>Works well and quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t and leave it on 120 you will probably burn it out quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a compact dryer and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>The dryer works quickly and dries my shoulder length hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>The air flow is nice and smooth, not too hot, the hair drys quickly, the unit is not too noisy, nor too heavy in your hand, and the hair is nice and shiny at the end.</li>
            <li>low setting is just right for my fine hair and the hot setting is good also.  </li>
            <li>As to the hair getting sucked in, that&#x27;s problematic of most hair dryers that are high wattage.  </li>
            <li>This was great for traveling &amp; I liked the other features (cool set button, attachments, ion), but after 11 months of usage, it suddenly died.</li>
            <li>The wife was very pleased with the &amp;#34;dual voltage&amp;#34; feature on our recent trip to England.  </li>
            <li>It is a perfect size, not too large and not too small, and it has two speeds.  </li>
            <li>Probably good for domestic travel but not so good for foreign travel.  </li>
            <li>I read before that the Ionic Ceramic Dryer has a new technology, making the hair to look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>It folds up so its easy to pack and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in your bag when traveling, which is nice because my old dryer and diffuser took up way to much space!  </li>
            <li>This is will be so much easier to travel with!!</li>
            <li>I just got mine and burned on the first try!</li>
            <li>The dryer is very compact and lightweight, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is dual voltage since I travel frequently.</li>
            <li>Powerful and compact.  </li>
            <li>but I wish it had just a couple features that I enjoyed having on my old travel dryer.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the cord could wind up inside of the dryer, especially since the barrel gets so hot that I have to wait for the dryer to cool off before I can wrap the cord and put it away.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much, got a second one.</li>
            <li>My wife liked the diffuser and overall design.</li>
            <li>But for the price it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is lighter, quieter, and the diffuser fits more securely than my last hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight yet powerful and portable even with a power cord attached.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dryer; as its lightweight and folds for easy storage and travel.</li>
            <li>Great attachments..folds up super small and compact...</li>
            <li>Dries hair relatively quickly and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  </li>
            <li>It had good power on high or low settings.</li>
            <li>Ordered it and got it right away from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I also shop online because I am elderly and everything comes right at my door without carrying alot around which I cannot do.</li>
            <li>Great little hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I love how quiet it is and how quickly it dries my hair.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get a better deal.</li>
            <li>The high speed is hot for drying and the low speed is warm enough to be effective for styling.  </li>
            <li>Small size was great for travel but doesn&#x27;t work with higher than US voltage</li>
            <li>This felt very cheap, like a toy blow dryer, so I sent it back and got a conair instead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very loud, and I love how small it is -- great for travel.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted over 5 years.</li>
            <li>Cord appears fragile and comes with instructions not to wrap it around the dryer so yet more space lost in the suitcase.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 3-4 years.  </li>
            <li>First one lasted 3 yrs.</li>
            <li>Wish I had bought this one first.</li>
            <li>He changed it for me, but the first time I used it it &amp;#34;blew&amp;#34; my adapter.</li>
            <li>I obviously wasn&#x27;t pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what you need it to do</li>
            <li>I had meant to purchase a different model (with more bells and whistles)</li>
            <li>but this one has been very reliable!</li>
            <li>I travel to West Africa often and need the higher voltage.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too hot, it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall I am extremely pleased with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I got this exact one for Christmas</li>
            <li>it is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It was good for a few months...</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it at home (way too loud and not as powerful), but it&#x27;s half the weight and works 85% as well as the Babyliss - perfect for an international carry-on suitcase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well, works quickly for the size and is light enough for travel.</li>
            <li>Good dryer for international (different voltages and frequencies) use.</li>
            <li>It is also very light, has a concentrator, and has high and low speeds.  </li>
            <li>It does not have as much power as a full-sized model and the handle gets hot after prolonged use.</li>
            <li>It is overpriced, and does not perform anywhere near a true ionic dryer.  </li>
            <li>Even though the package directions said it couldn&#x27;t be used on the high setting when using the 220 current in Italy, I was able to use it with no problem.  </li>
            <li>It dries your hair pretty fast even though it doesn&#x27;t appear to be generating much heat.</li>
            <li>several years ago it is still going strong but one day it will die</li>
            <li>Too large to be considered a travel dryer.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m a hair dryer snob (curly haired girl who blow dries straight every day).  </li>
            <li>Bought a second because I could not find a diffuser that might fit.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It makes packing for trip much easier.</li>
            <li>if you want a great travel dryer that you will use only on a couple trips a year, this is the one, but don&#x27;t expect it to last for regular use.  </li>
            <li>is that the concentrator attachment is sturdy and connects with the end of the barrel very well.</li>
            <li>It was very convenient changing the voltage input from 125 - 250, just a 90 degree turn on the voltage selector</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know much about styling products</li>
            <li>Thanks Revlon.</li>
            <li>I really like the power for a lite weight hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for the past week in preparation for an extended trip, and it&#x27;s performed beautifully with drying times very close to what I achieve with my regular full-sized ionic ceramic dryer.  </li>
            <li>These &amp;#34;finger&amp;#34; diffusers are supposed to lift hair while drying gently so that the hair&#x27;s curl is preserved.  </li>
            <li>Hope the high voltage is not a problem in Europe!</li>
            <li>Is that really the lifespan of a hair dryer these days???</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>you want it to be gentle heat.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been working very well and hasn&#x27;t acted up at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that the dryer comes with two different heads, but I don&#x27;t really use them - especially the diffuser.</li>
            <li>The ladies of the house really like this dryer.</li>
            <li>They always have what you want , and ship really fast.</li>
            <li>At least it has good power.</li>
            <li>but it was still very loud and too hot.  </li>
            <li>we have different textures ranging from fine, normal, to coarse/frizzy/wavy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to switch voltage, and only needed to use plug adapter for Middle East.</li>
            <li>We needed a travel hair dryer and this one has the dual wattage which makes it very easy to switch back and forth as necessary.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been incredibly happy with this reasonably priced dryer, and am looking forward to the small amount of space it takes up on my next trip!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely lightweight, compact enough for small drawers and luggage, very powerful and perfect for styling long hair quickly.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to dry your hair fast, that&#x27;s fine but for using the diffuser for curls, you don&#x27;t want your power to be too high...</li>
            <li>All 220-240V. Works like any regular 1875W US full size.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, it deserves 10 stars.</li>
            <li>I chose this model because it was highly reviewed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, easy to use, priced right.</li>
            <li>Regardless of how much something costs (this is very reasonably priced), an item should last longer than a year!</li>
            <li>the low setting is all you really need, high is way too hot</li>
            <li>I have had all of the expensive hair dryers and none have lasted, nor have they worked all that great.</li>
            <li>I normally use a Chi dryer and have never had this problem.</li>
            <li>The dryer does seem powerful although it has only two settings.</li>
            <li>Normal texture but a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>Seems to do a good job blowing my thick, coarse hair straight.</li>
            <li>Switched back and forth between high and low and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Makes my short thin hair nice and full and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>I just purchased a new one and it works well.</li>
            <li>But inside it is in brand new condition.</li>
            <li>I like this hair dryer for several reasons: it is light weight and does not kill your arms after a drying session with very long hair; it is sturdy and does not draw too much power.</li>
            <li>Nice hair dryer but too heavy and big for my travel.</li>
            <li>Of course, I was aware that this model is lacking these features when I bought it, but I didn&#x27;t anticipate missing them as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I do like very much</li>
            <li>There are only two settings - high and low, and a cool button.</li>
            <li>As a former employee, I ask one of the HOT engineers before I jump out there and make the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Only writing this so that you are aware that this is TRAVEL size.  </li>
            <li>Wore out the first and am now on my second.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, not thick, and curly, and this dryer has enough heat to dry it adequately, altho I typically don&#x27;t dry my hair completely before I leave the house, to help minimize heat damage.  </li>
            <li>It dried my hair about 80% as well as my pro dryer (and as well as, or better than, the cheaper full size dryer I had previously).  </li>
            <li>Left this dryer in my hotel room on my first and last trip with it - wasn&#x27;t worth the extra luggage space.</li>
            <li>It is small and light and folds in half for easy storage for travel.</li>
            <li>The exception to my adoration of this product is that it frequently catches hair into the motor.  </li>
            <li>Worked for 30 seconds, then broke (loud noise, fan stopped blowing).  </li>
            <li>I tried this out at home and it has as much power as my larger blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Really, though, that is a slim chance if I&#x27;m awake enough to pay attention!</li>
            <li>When I got home I tossed my old dryer and got this one.</li>
            <li>The diffuser has holes so larger that the air isn&#x27;t gently spread.</li>
            <li>It also blew out the outlet it was plugged into (our house is 4 years old</li>
            <li>so it is not an old outlet problem)</li>
            <li>double voltage swith is very usefull.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller that its counterpart, RV544PKF, but with the same powerful air flow.  </li>
            <li>Also, the cord seems to be a little longer than on some other hair dryers which came in handy on some occasions.</li>
            <li>I bought this one specifically for the diffuser, however, if you dry your hair upside down or at an angle where your hair is on top on the dryer, it&#x27;ll suck up your hair and tear it out.</li>
            <li>It folds so it is easy to pack in a small carry on or checked</li>
            <li>Against the recommendations of previous reviews, I bought this because i couldn&#x27;t imagine how those reviews would actually be true.  </li>
            <li>Arrived vary quickly, vary power which I need for my vary think hair, not complaining I am 64 a little loud, but a lot of power.</li>
            <li>I wanted something small and light weight.</li>
            <li>Now I use it everyday, there&#x27;s no reason to buy a second one for home!&lt;br /&gt;There are only two things that would make this dryer better . . .</li>
            <li>The hot/high setting gets very very hot but the low is not powerful enough to dry my hair quickly in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have very long, curly hair and this dryer works very well for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>Did not think this would dry my hair as straight as my Solano</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t happen very often (&amp; only takes a second to fix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well except for folding the handle making it less useful for traveling.</li>
            <li>Though the diffuser is supposed to dry your hair frizz-free, it takes about x15 as long and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Highly recommended dryer for domestic or international travel.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have about this dryer is why does the cool shot function has to operate at a lower output even when the high setting were selected.</li>
            <li>Small hair dryer that even becomes smaller when you fold the handle in, attachments that fit so they are not falling off onto my head while in use.</li>
            <li>I intended only to use it for travel but the day after it arrived, my old blow dryer started smoking</li>
            <li>This dryer is fast &amp; leaves everyone&#x27;s hair soft, shiny, sleek, &amp; less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I think my only concern is that because I have long hair and this hair dryer is small the chances of my hair getting caught in the back of it are greater.</li>
            <li>The handle folds smoothly against the barrel of the dryer to make the unit compact for travel, and the cord is long enough to give you a few feet of range space from the outlet if you&#x27;re the multi-tasking type.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that the cool button completely diminishes the blowdryer&#x27;s force.</li>
            <li>Too big and too heavy to travel with (plus very long cable and huge plug).</li>
            <li>I do not dry my hair every day, maybe 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that I wonder if the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting is more like a medium just from comparing it to my previous hair dryer which has low, medium and high settings.</li>
            <li>is lightweight the high speed setting did not cause issues in Germany, but I was careful not to keep it on that setting for longer than 10min at a time.  </li>
            <li>There is a high and a low setting for heat, but i always use high, because low produces very less heat and as a result, takes a lot of time to dry your hair.</li>

            <li> We own three of them in our household.  </li>
            <li> took it inter ational and used the converter and voltage regulater and could not get enought power to be effective.</li>
            <li> While visiting family I borrowed my niece&#x27;s ionic ceramic dryer and I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice my hair came out.</li>
            <li> Liked it until it stopped working out of nowhere</li>
            <li> I liked my conair dryer but this one tops that one.</li>
            <li> I just bought this hair dryer to replace an ancient one, and I have to honestly say that I think I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size and really easy to manage because it&#x27;s not so bulky like so many others with diffusers.</li>
            <li> Great for travel when a full size dryer isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> Not as happy as I am with my full size dryer but</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is [THE] perfect dryer as it looks cool, perfectly balance and comfortable in your hand, has all the latest dryer gizmo, it is powerful and feather light by weight and on your pocket.</li>
            <li> The dryer has a screw that makes it very easy to switch 220/110.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong hair dryer for a travel size.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to change the voltage on the handle when travelling.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to be able to have my own dryer on a 3-week trip to Europe.</li>
            <li> Sister loved this.gift did not feel cheap.  </li>
            <li> I use the diffuser most of the time, but it&#x27;s nice to have a concentrator.</li>
            <li> Worked super awesome on the first time use.  </li>
            <li> Pretty great hairdryer for the price</li>
            <li> The Ionic feature is a very important reason why I chose this model.  </li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly but emits a burning smell, which can&#x27;t be good for anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and I love the fact that its handle can bend.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is all it claimed to be and more.  </li>
            <li> So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Probably perfect for short hair</li>
            <li> Perfect for international Travel!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer before and it lasted many years.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but I think it could be a bit more sophisticated.</li>
            <li> And since it has been more than 30 days since I had bought it, Amazon does not allow me to return it.</li>
            <li> so you MUST get an appropriate plug adaptor for the country you are visiting.</li>
            <li> I used the dryer her on US wattage and it was ok.  </li>
            <li> Many times hotel hairdryers don&#x27;t have nozzle attachments</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> Favorite feature:  they fold up for storage and travel.  </li>
            <li> Worked perfect in both countries and only needed the adapter plug.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the power, compact size and diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I am thankful my daughter wasn&#x27;t using it, as I am sure she would have been burned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s just me :-).</li>
            <li> I have used it in the US, Central America, and West Africa with great results!</li>
            <li> I like the attachments which allow me to style my hair better.</li>
            <li> But I still wish it stopped the static as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this service.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> The small size makes it ideal for holding and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, but if this is going to be your main blow dryer, than I would reconsider.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly and folds up nicely for travel.</li>
            <li> Is handy and if you are looking for something to use daily, this is the one, works great.</li>
            <li> Worked fine there although make SURE</li>
            <li> okay if you don&#x27;t mind a lightweight model with a slightly cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li> : I have mid-length hair, so static is an important issue.</li>
            <li> Works great, just like a full size dryer but much lighter</li>
            <li> It is light weight &amp; easy to maneuver a great little dryer at a great price.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easy to handle (I have sore hands and wrists).</li>
            <li> Easy to switch between 110 and 220.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair even quicker and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is lightweight and folds for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased thank you much</li>
            <li> This is OK, but would have liked for it to stay on high speed when I push that button.  </li>
            <li> Well, the dryer works fine</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave fine hair frizzy</li>
            <li> Fine hair dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer because it&#x27;s compact and dries my hair really, really quickly.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s a hard thing to say about many hair dryers - it&#x27;s the perfect compliment to all bathroom accessories.</li>
            <li> Amazon, though, is fantastic, and is shipping a replacement overnight.  </li>
            <li> It is also light weight.</li>
            <li> It died a year after purchase, but I had liked it so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using this as my primary dryer rather than a travel dryer.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, fabulous product . . .</li>
            <li> The hairdryer is light but has plenty of power.  </li>
            <li> Great product with dual voltage to cater for travels outside US.</li>
            <li> Light and functional with hair attachment is a bonus,</li>
            <li> It is very portable which is nice for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Unreliable appearance - looks like a cheap toy.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> It is, arguably, loud (think jetliner at takeoff), but it&#x27;s nearly as good as my Babyliss Pro TT.</li>
            <li> Kind of low power but for it&#x27;s size it is a pretty good hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Below is my original review.</li>
            <li> first one lasted about 10 years), and it lasts longer and works better than any of them.</li>
            <li> Just what I was expecting and love that the in dual voltage really works!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, lightweight, travels well, and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> I own a professional level dryer at home and was trying to come up with a solution that would fit into carry-on luggage that was somewhat comparable.  </li>
            <li> I love this dryer-- great size for traveling and for everyday use at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also foldable, so pretty easy to fit in your handbag during travel.</li>
            <li> Nothing else, the price is right!</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The Hair dryer worked very well and satisfied every expectation.</li>
            <li> Two heat settings and a cool set.  </li>
            <li> I was traveling to Africa and needed a true dual voltage ceramic dryer.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad hair dryer - worked well</li>
            <li> I have bought other Revlon blow dryers and have been happy with the purchases.</li>
            <li> Worked fine at first but stopped working In under a year of ownership.  </li>
            <li> Works well and quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t and leave it on 120 you will probably burn it out quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a compact dryer and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> The dryer works quickly and dries my shoulder length hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> The air flow is nice and smooth, not too hot, the hair drys quickly, the unit is not too noisy, nor too heavy in your hand, and the hair is nice and shiny at the end.</li>
            <li> low setting is just right for my fine hair and the hot setting is good also.  </li>
            <li> As to the hair getting sucked in, that&#x27;s problematic of most hair dryers that are high wattage.  </li>
            <li> This was great for traveling &amp; I liked the other features (cool set button, attachments, ion), but after 11 months of usage, it suddenly died.</li>
            <li> The wife was very pleased with the &amp;#34;dual voltage&amp;#34; feature on our recent trip to England.  </li>
            <li> It is a perfect size, not too large and not too small, and it has two speeds.  </li>
            <li> Probably good for domestic travel but not so good for foreign travel.  </li>
            <li> I read before that the Ionic Ceramic Dryer has a new technology, making the hair to look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> It folds up so its easy to pack and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in your bag when traveling, which is nice because my old dryer and diffuser took up way to much space!  </li>
            <li> This is will be so much easier to travel with!!</li>
            <li> I just got mine and burned on the first try!</li>
            <li> The dryer is very compact and lightweight, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is dual voltage since I travel frequently.</li>
            <li> Powerful and compact.  </li>
            <li> but I wish it had just a couple features that I enjoyed having on my old travel dryer.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the cord could wind up inside of the dryer, especially since the barrel gets so hot that I have to wait for the dryer to cool off before I can wrap the cord and put it away.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much, got a second one.</li>
            <li> My wife liked the diffuser and overall design.</li>
            <li> But for the price it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is lighter, quieter, and the diffuser fits more securely than my last hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight yet powerful and portable even with a power cord attached.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dryer; as its lightweight and folds for easy storage and travel.</li>
            <li> Great attachments..folds up super small and compact...</li>
            <li> Dries hair relatively quickly and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  </li>
            <li> It had good power on high or low settings.</li>
            <li> Ordered it and got it right away from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I also shop online because I am elderly and everything comes right at my door without carrying alot around which I cannot do.</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I love how quiet it is and how quickly it dries my hair.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get a better deal.</li>
            <li> The high speed is hot for drying and the low speed is warm enough to be effective for styling.  </li>
            <li> Small size was great for travel but doesn&#x27;t work with higher than US voltage</li>
            <li> This felt very cheap, like a toy blow dryer, so I sent it back and got a conair instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very loud, and I love how small it is -- great for travel.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted over 5 years.</li>
            <li> Cord appears fragile and comes with instructions not to wrap it around the dryer so yet more space lost in the suitcase.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 3-4 years.  </li>
            <li> First one lasted 3 yrs.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this one first.</li>
            <li> He changed it for me, but the first time I used it it &amp;#34;blew&amp;#34; my adapter.</li>
            <li> I obviously wasn&#x27;t pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what you need it to do</li>
            <li> I had meant to purchase a different model (with more bells and whistles)</li>
            <li> but this one has been very reliable!</li>
            <li> I travel to West Africa often and need the higher voltage.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too hot, it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall I am extremely pleased with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I got this exact one for Christmas</li>
            <li> it is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It was good for a few months...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it at home (way too loud and not as powerful), but it&#x27;s half the weight and works 85% as well as the Babyliss - perfect for an international carry-on suitcase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well, works quickly for the size and is light enough for travel.</li>
            <li> Good dryer for international (different voltages and frequencies) use.</li>
            <li> It is also very light, has a concentrator, and has high and low speeds.  </li>
            <li> It does not have as much power as a full-sized model and the handle gets hot after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> It is overpriced, and does not perform anywhere near a true ionic dryer.  </li>
            <li> Even though the package directions said it couldn&#x27;t be used on the high setting when using the 220 current in Italy, I was able to use it with no problem.  </li>
            <li> It dries your hair pretty fast even though it doesn&#x27;t appear to be generating much heat.</li>
            <li> several years ago it is still going strong but one day it will die</li>
            <li> Too large to be considered a travel dryer.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m a hair dryer snob (curly haired girl who blow dries straight every day).  </li>
            <li> Bought a second because I could not find a diffuser that might fit.</li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It makes packing for trip much easier.</li>
            <li> if you want a great travel dryer that you will use only on a couple trips a year, this is the one, but don&#x27;t expect it to last for regular use.  </li>
            <li> is that the concentrator attachment is sturdy and connects with the end of the barrel very well.</li>
            <li> It was very convenient changing the voltage input from 125 - 250, just a 90 degree turn on the voltage selector</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about styling products</li>
            <li> Thanks Revlon.</li>
            <li> I really like the power for a lite weight hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for the past week in preparation for an extended trip, and it&#x27;s performed beautifully with drying times very close to what I achieve with my regular full-sized ionic ceramic dryer.  </li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;finger&amp;#34; diffusers are supposed to lift hair while drying gently so that the hair&#x27;s curl is preserved.  </li>
            <li> Hope the high voltage is not a problem in Europe!</li>
            <li> Is that really the lifespan of a hair dryer these days???</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> you want it to be gentle heat.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been working very well and hasn&#x27;t acted up at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that the dryer comes with two different heads, but I don&#x27;t really use them - especially the diffuser.</li>
            <li> The ladies of the house really like this dryer.</li>
            <li> They always have what you want , and ship really fast.</li>
            <li> At least it has good power.</li>
            <li> but it was still very loud and too hot.  </li>
            <li> we have different textures ranging from fine, normal, to coarse/frizzy/wavy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to switch voltage, and only needed to use plug adapter for Middle East.</li>
            <li> We needed a travel hair dryer and this one has the dual wattage which makes it very easy to switch back and forth as necessary.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been incredibly happy with this reasonably priced dryer, and am looking forward to the small amount of space it takes up on my next trip!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely lightweight, compact enough for small drawers and luggage, very powerful and perfect for styling long hair quickly.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to dry your hair fast, that&#x27;s fine but for using the diffuser for curls, you don&#x27;t want your power to be too high...</li>
            <li> All 220-240V. Works like any regular 1875W US full size.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, it deserves 10 stars.</li>
            <li> I chose this model because it was highly reviewed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, easy to use, priced right.</li>
            <li> Regardless of how much something costs (this is very reasonably priced), an item should last longer than a year!</li>
            <li> the low setting is all you really need, high is way too hot</li>
            <li> I have had all of the expensive hair dryers and none have lasted, nor have they worked all that great.</li>
            <li> I normally use a Chi dryer and have never had this problem.</li>
            <li> The dryer does seem powerful although it has only two settings.</li>
            <li> Normal texture but a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> Seems to do a good job blowing my thick, coarse hair straight.</li>
            <li> Switched back and forth between high and low and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Makes my short thin hair nice and full and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a new one and it works well.</li>
            <li> But inside it is in brand new condition.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer for several reasons: it is light weight and does not kill your arms after a drying session with very long hair; it is sturdy and does not draw too much power.</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer but too heavy and big for my travel.</li>
            <li> Of course, I was aware that this model is lacking these features when I bought it, but I didn&#x27;t anticipate missing them as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I do like very much</li>
            <li> There are only two settings - high and low, and a cool button.</li>
            <li> As a former employee, I ask one of the HOT engineers before I jump out there and make the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Only writing this so that you are aware that this is TRAVEL size.  </li>
            <li> Wore out the first and am now on my second.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, not thick, and curly, and this dryer has enough heat to dry it adequately, altho I typically don&#x27;t dry my hair completely before I leave the house, to help minimize heat damage.  </li>
            <li> It dried my hair about 80% as well as my pro dryer (and as well as, or better than, the cheaper full size dryer I had previously).  </li>
            <li> Left this dryer in my hotel room on my first and last trip with it - wasn&#x27;t worth the extra luggage space.</li>
            <li> It is small and light and folds in half for easy storage for travel.</li>
            <li> The exception to my adoration of this product is that it frequently catches hair into the motor.  </li>
            <li> Worked for 30 seconds, then broke (loud noise, fan stopped blowing).  </li>
            <li> I tried this out at home and it has as much power as my larger blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Really, though, that is a slim chance if I&#x27;m awake enough to pay attention!</li>
            <li> When I got home I tossed my old dryer and got this one.</li>
            <li> The diffuser has holes so larger that the air isn&#x27;t gently spread.</li>
            <li> It also blew out the outlet it was plugged into (our house is 4 years old</li>
            <li> so it is not an old outlet problem)</li>
            <li> double voltage swith is very usefull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller that its counterpart, RV544PKF, but with the same powerful air flow.  </li>
            <li> Also, the cord seems to be a little longer than on some other hair dryers which came in handy on some occasions.</li>
            <li> I bought this one specifically for the diffuser, however, if you dry your hair upside down or at an angle where your hair is on top on the dryer, it&#x27;ll suck up your hair and tear it out.</li>
            <li> It folds so it is easy to pack in a small carry on or checked</li>
            <li> Against the recommendations of previous reviews, I bought this because i couldn&#x27;t imagine how those reviews would actually be true.  </li>
            <li> Arrived vary quickly, vary power which I need for my vary think hair, not complaining I am 64 a little loud, but a lot of power.</li>
            <li> I wanted something small and light weight.</li>
            <li> Now I use it everyday, there&#x27;s no reason to buy a second one for home!&lt;br /&gt;There are only two things that would make this dryer better . . .</li>
            <li> The hot/high setting gets very very hot but the low is not powerful enough to dry my hair quickly in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have very long, curly hair and this dryer works very well for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> Did not think this would dry my hair as straight as my Solano</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t happen very often (&amp; only takes a second to fix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well except for folding the handle making it less useful for traveling.</li>
            <li> Though the diffuser is supposed to dry your hair frizz-free, it takes about x15 as long and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Highly recommended dryer for domestic or international travel.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this dryer is why does the cool shot function has to operate at a lower output even when the high setting were selected.</li>
            <li> Small hair dryer that even becomes smaller when you fold the handle in, attachments that fit so they are not falling off onto my head while in use.</li>
            <li> I intended only to use it for travel but the day after it arrived, my old blow dryer started smoking</li>
            <li> This dryer is fast &amp; leaves everyone&#x27;s hair soft, shiny, sleek, &amp; less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I think my only concern is that because I have long hair and this hair dryer is small the chances of my hair getting caught in the back of it are greater.</li>
            <li> The handle folds smoothly against the barrel of the dryer to make the unit compact for travel, and the cord is long enough to give you a few feet of range space from the outlet if you&#x27;re the multi-tasking type.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the cool button completely diminishes the blowdryer&#x27;s force.</li>
            <li> Too big and too heavy to travel with (plus very long cable and huge plug).</li>
            <li> I do not dry my hair every day, maybe 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that I wonder if the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting is more like a medium just from comparing it to my previous hair dryer which has low, medium and high settings.</li>
            <li> is lightweight the high speed setting did not cause issues in Germany, but I was careful not to keep it on that setting for longer than 10min at a time.  </li>
            <li> There is a high and a low setting for heat, but i always use high, because low produces very less heat and as a result, takes a lot of time to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> A powerful tool for such a small size!</li>
            <li> Dries hair in less than 5 minuets, I am a very busy person so this is a big plus.</li>
            <li> a few minutes after i started using it the metals inside the nozzle started to turn red and heat up, i could smell plastic burning and the material the dryer itself is made of is very cheap and weak.</li>
            <li> It takes almost an hour to dry my hair with this tool, and my naturally straight hair is only to about 3 inches below my shoulders (so not super long).</li>
            <li> Long story short, it does not last.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t even need to use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t choose the 5 star rating because I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to determine how well it will work over time.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and I&#x27;m pretty used to never getting it completely dry in the morning, but this product does the trick.</li>
            <li> 2 Heat/Speed Settings: High (Hot) &amp; Low (Warm)&lt;br /&gt;- Cold Shot feature</li>
            <li> Love that is has the cold blast option too..</li>
            <li> so nothing too long.    </li>
            <li> Hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The power cord seems thinner than previous dryers don&#x27;t know if that is a good or bad thing.</li>
            <li> It takes about 45 minutes before it actually gets hot enough to dry hair, but only lasts for 3 seconds before it shoots cold air out for a while before it warms back up again.</li>
            <li> As I was using it a spark flew out of the bottom of the hair dryer, and then a LONG FLAME!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other models before settling with this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.</li>
            <li> but my hair is very long and takes quite a bit of time to dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any issues with it and as a hair dry, it does its work.  </li>
            <li> I really thought the ionic thing was just crazy, but it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I have very long loose curly hair.  </li>
            <li> We had one burn out, but it was used every single day by two people for a couple years.  </li>
            <li> the cord is really long and makes it just a little bigger when you wrap it up for storage or packing!  </li>
            <li> So a year and a half later</li>
            <li> We quickly unplugged it and set it outside in the cold air and never turned it on again.  </li>
            <li> Also the handle, which is supposed to fold back neatly for travel, rattles in your hand a little</li>
            <li> but the plug is a little bit different from the ones in China.</li>
            <li> I have to be really careful &amp; the minute I forget...</li>
            <li> Would have been an extra star if they supplied a few plug adaptors.</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> It worked exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s a waste of money and especially time in the morning b</li>
            <li> I like having fast, intense cold air to dry my hair, but this dryer&#x27;s cold button really is like a &amp;#34;cool + low&amp;#34</li>
            <li> a heat control setting-it only has one hot temperature and a cold shot button, and a retractable cord -</li>
            <li> My hair always takes forever to dry and this can do it in less than 30 minutes, which is a miracle for me.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leery about regular year round use since it was billed as a travel dryer, but I had read several reviews from people using it everyday, so I went ahead.  </li>
            <li> Only down side is it needs to be replaced every few years, but a this price it is still a bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it said it was small but its really big.</li>
            <li> I was not aware that I was purchasing a TRAVEL size dryer.  </li>
            <li> Worked just as well, if not better than, my regular hair dryer I have at home for everyday.  </li>
            <li> and have never experienced this problem so frequently.  </li>
            <li> If you need your wet hair dried in a hurry and don&#x27;t mind the frizzy look, this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> , the cold-shot button depresses all the way down into the handle.</li>
            <li> I use it to fill my daughters Barbie Doll&#x27;s bounce house and it has not let us down.</li>
            <li> I like that the handle folds down</li>
            <li> Typical made-in-China junk.  </li>
            <li> Lasted less than 5 seconds using 240 volts.  </li>
            <li> It dries just as well as a drier half</li>
            <li> Typical life span I guess.</li>
            <li> I think I go through about 1 every year and a half.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair in half the time of my previous hair dryer.</li>
            <li> so it takes up less space.  </li>
            <li> The dryer got extremely hot and sounded unhappy.</li>
            <li> The plug-in looka a bit odd; it&#x27;s large and looks awkward in my outlet.</li>
            <li> Not a whinny sounds like some other small dryers.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing this, but this little Revlon dryer seems to work every bit as well as my $100</li>
            <li> The little dryer did the job.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is a dynamo....</li>
            <li> Its lightweight but not light on power.</li>
            <li> It works well, isn&#x27;t too heavy, and seems to be holding up well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Concentrator attachment works well w/a round brush</li>
            <li> I would recommend this dryer to anyone traveling or for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> This is powerful travel hairdryer, unfortunately, it came broken, but couldnt return it.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the two heat and speed settings.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I&#x27;m blowdrying w/my round brush &amp; pushing both together and upwards, the hinge will fail and the blowdryer will fold down in the middle of the stroke.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for a work trip since the past few times I&#x27;ve traveled without a dryer, the crappy one at the hotel has literally shut off from being overheated halfway thru the drying process.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll keep my fingers crossed that the replacement works for at least a few months</li>
            <li> Straightens and dries my thick hair in minutes (with a round brush)</li>
            <li> Small &amp; Compact.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality</li>
            <li> Sometimes it \\&quot;sucks up\\&quot; mine while I&#x27;m drying the girls&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> I was two days late for the return cutoff.</li>
            <li> I have 3 daughters, and while we all have thick hair...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is not good.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the effectiveness of this small hair dryer</li>
            <li> Weak hinge:</li>
            <li> Dries my very thick hair in no time.  </li>
            <li> approximately 23 cm</li>
            <li> It arrived as is product from the warehouse because of the broken box.</li>
            <li> I will order another when my \\&quot;home\\&quot; dryer finally fails.  </li>
            <li> Worst possible dryer ever.  </li>
            <li> I was in Australia for just under a month and unfortunately for me</li>
            <li> very poor costumer service;they wont change it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately , this dryer is very flawed.</li>
            <li> I was afraid my hair would catch on fire every time.</li>
            <li> The speed reduces to the lower speed when using the cold shot button.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I read on the box \\&quot;REVLON TRAVELER&#x27;S SPEED</li>
            <li> AWFUL AND VERY POOR QUALITY SAVE YOUR MONEY AND PURCHASE</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> - I thought maybe I just had a bad adapter, so I borrowed my roommates adapter, and it &amp;#34;blew&amp;#34; that one too!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really awful product.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune if buying.</li>
            <li> Pathetic!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought it to travel because of the compact size and the fact that it folds and it has dual voltage. It works well!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one! The first one lasted over 5 years. Love that it is dual voltage since I travel frequently. I highly recommend this dryer; as its lightweight and folds for easy storage and travel. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to Oman and Dubai.  I was extremely pleased. Its lightweight but not light on power. It&#x27;s very easy to switch voltage, and only needed to use plug adapter for Middle East. Worked just as well, if not better than, my regular hair dryer I have at home for everyday.  And I&#x27;m a hair dryer snob (curly haired girl who blow dries straight every day).  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have 3 daughters, and while we all have thick hair...we have different textures ranging from fine, normal, to coarse/frizzy/wavy.  Our hair lengths range from chin length to 1\\&quot; below shoulder...so nothing too long.    This dryer is fast &amp; leaves everyone&#x27;s hair soft, shiny, sleek, &amp; less frizzy.  It also travels well as it folds for storage.    The exception to my adoration of this product is that it frequently catches hair into the motor.  Sometimes it \\&quot;sucks up\\&quot; mine while I&#x27;m drying the girls&#x27; hair.  Occasionally it catches their hair.  I&#x27;ve been using hair dryers for 25+ yrs. and have never experienced this problem so frequently.  I have to be really careful &amp; the minute I forget...we&#x27;ve singed a bit of hair.  UGGH!!</li>
            <li> Longest lasting dryer I have purchased . Bought a second because I could not find a diffuser that might fit. So this purchase is for a back up travel dryer.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it lasts and lasts and lasts. Never had a problem with this appliance.</li>
            <li> This Dryer is great. I have really thick hair, and I&#x27;m pretty used to never getting it completely dry in the morning, but this product does the trick. It&#x27;s not very loud, and I love how small it is -- great for travel.</li>
            <li> This is powerful travel hairdryer, unfortunately, it came broken, but couldnt return it.</li>
            <li> Too large to be considered a travel dryer.  The folding handle helps but it is still too big.  Cord appears fragile and comes with instructions not to wrap it around the dryer so yet more space lost in the suitcase. Dryer instructions state it can only work on low if using 250 setting.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Europe! All 220-240V. Works like any regular 1875W US full size.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for a trip overseas and didn&#x27;t want to deal with converters, etc. Well, the dryer works fine but it doesn&#x27;t put out a lot of wind volume.</li>
            <li> great buy. love it. fast delivery.</li>
            <li> As a former employee, I ask one of the HOT engineers before I jump out there and make the purchase.  This was the recommended Dual voltage dryer.  As to the hair getting sucked in, that&#x27;s problematic of most hair dryers that are high wattage.  We put a finer mesh screen over the rear inlet area to prevent that. It obviously is still an issue and I will forward that review.  I will buy this though for my upcoming trip to the UK.</li>
            <li> Worked for 30 seconds, then broke (loud noise, fan stopped blowing).  Typical made-in-China junk.  Amazon, though, is fantastic, and is shipping a replacement overnight.  Why a replacement?  Cause I&#x27;m leaving the country in two days and NEED a dual voltage ionic and ceramic hair dryer with a diffuser, and there aren&#x27;t a lot of options on Amazon. So I&#x27;ll keep my fingers crossed that the replacement works for at least a few months</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s smaller that its counterpart, RV544PKF, but with the same powerful air flow.  It is lightweight and I love the fact that its handle can bend.  It makes packing for trip much easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a manageable size and has good range of temperatures. It is also light weight. The power cord seems thinner than previous dryers don&#x27;t know if that is a good or bad thing. Hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the effectiveness of this small hair dryer but I needed one for travel and ordered it.  This dryer is all it claimed to be and more.  It is lightweight and easy to handle (I have sore hands and wrists). The high speed is hot for drying and the low speed is warm enough to be effective for styling.  I will order another when my \\&quot;home\\&quot; dryer finally fails.  Good product and excellent service.</li>
            <li> Product does FRY hair, but is advertised as a hair dryer.  If you need your wet hair dried in a hurry and don&#x27;t mind the frizzy look, this product is for you.  It is overpriced, and does not perform anywhere near a true ionic dryer.  Stick with the T3&#x27;s, you get what you pay for in this instance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size and really easy to manage because it&#x27;s not so bulky like so many others with diffusers. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars only because it has died on me already. I bought this in Feb 2012. So a year and a half later and it has stopped working, and I don&#x27;t even use it every day!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer so I would have a travel one with a diffuser for an upcoming trip. I tried it out when it arrived. It worked great! So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> it just worked for 3 months and it was done afterward. do not recommend it. very poor costumer service;they wont change it.</li>
            <li> I read before that the Ionic Ceramic Dryer has a new technology, making the hair to look healthy and shiny.I purchased from Amazon - Revlon RVDR5001 1875 Watt Ionic Ceramic Dryer and I am completely satisfied.My hair looks so good!</li>
            <li> This was great for traveling &amp; I liked the other features (cool set button, attachments, ion), but after 11 months of usage, it suddenly died. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer!. I have one for travel and one for home.  Powerful and compact.  Straightens and dries my thick hair in minutes (with a round brush) so I don&#x27;t even need to use a flat iron.  Only down side is it needs to be replaced every few years, but a this price it is still a bargain.</li>
            <li> It broke after maybe a month of usage!  Do not buy... I was afraid my hair would catch on fire every time.</li>
            <li> There is no low speed.</li>
            <li> It works well, isn&#x27;t too heavy, and seems to be holding up well.  The only thing I wish is that it had a lower speed.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, but if this is going to be your main blow dryer, than I would reconsider. It does not have as much power as a full-sized model and the handle gets hot after prolonged use. Probably perfect for short hair but my hair is very long and takes quite a bit of time to dry.</li>
            <li> Perfect for international Travel!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. I wanted something small and light weight. I always use the low setting with the hair diffuser. I have had this hair dryer before and it lasted many years. I just purchased a new one and it works well. It had good power on high or low settings.</li>
            <li> The dryer is light-weight and looks sleek just like in the picture. It dries your hair pretty fast even though it doesn&#x27;t appear to be generating much heat. There is a high and a low setting for heat, but i always use high, because low produces very less heat and as a result, takes a lot of time to dry your hair. It is also foldable, so pretty easy to fit in your handbag during travel. It&#x27;s a great product and I love it.</li>
            <li> Loved this dryer when I bought it two years ago.  Was looking for something smaller that didn&#x27;t take up tons of space on the vanity.  This one filled the bill while still performing great!! I was a little leery about regular year round use since it was billed as a travel dryer, but I had read several reviews from people using it everyday, so I went ahead.  Long story short, it does not last.  It died a year after purchase, but I had liked it so much I thought maybe it was just a fluke.  Bought another, and that one died a year later.  Moral of the story:  if you want a great travel dryer that you will use only on a couple trips a year, this is the one, but don&#x27;t expect it to last for regular use.  I did not buy this on Amazon.  I bought it at Ulta, and would have posted a review there, but they don&#x27;t sell it anymore.  .</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer! Dries my very thick hair in no time.  I&#x27;m now using this as my primary dryer rather than a travel dryer.  It folds up pretty small.  Easy to switch between 110 and 220.</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer but too heavy and big for my travel.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this hair dryer.  My first one lasted about 3-4 years.  The price is great and it is nice and light.  Makes my short thin hair nice and full and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> Worst possible dryer ever.  Was set on 220v.  Worked super awesome on the first time use.  But sparks flew on the 2nd time. It grew bright orange and started to smoke and sparks were flying.  We quickly unplugged it and set it outside in the cold air and never turned it on again.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product for use what so ever.  Against the recommendations of previous reviews, I bought this because i couldn&#x27;t imagine how those reviews would actually be true.  Yea.. don&#x27;t make the same mistake!</li>
            <li> for future buyers...you can only operate this dryer on low setting at 220v...confirmed by Revlon</li>
            <li> The dryer itself works well but I wish it had just a couple features that I enjoyed having on my old travel dryer. I am not a huge fan of the two heat and speed settings. The hot/high setting gets very very hot but the low is not powerful enough to dry my hair quickly in the morning. It would be nice if the cord could wind up inside of the dryer, especially since the barrel gets so hot that I have to wait for the dryer to cool off before I can wrap the cord and put it away. Of course, I was aware that this model is lacking these features when I bought it, but I didn&#x27;t anticipate missing them as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I do like very much is that the concentrator attachment is sturdy and connects with the end of the barrel very well. It doesn&#x27;t fall off while I&#x27;m drying or while it gets pushed around in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the dryer itself works well but I think it could be a bit more sophisticated.</li>
            <li> The high-speed works well, the low is rather tepid. The plug-in looka a bit odd; it&#x27;s large and looks awkward in my outlet. But it does work.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. This is my second one from the same model &amp; brand. First one lasted 3 yrs. Not bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I purchased an Eva dryer.  This one does not break your hair when blow drying and gives you tons of body. Wish I had bought this one first.</li>
            <li> Lasted less than 5 seconds using 240 volts.  Small size was great for travel but doesn&#x27;t work with higher than US voltage</li>
            <li> The wife was very pleased with the &amp;#34;dual voltage&amp;#34; feature on our recent trip to England.  The Hair dryer worked very well and satisfied every expectation. It was very convenient changing the voltage input from 125 - 250, just a 90 degree turn on the voltage selector and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;Winemaker8802</li>
            <li> Perfect size, not too large, but has lots of drying power.  Not a whinny sounds like some other small dryers.  Loved it so much, got a second one.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a compact dryer with a diffuser attachment. I tried this out at home and it has as much power as my larger blow dryer. I have bought other Revlon blow dryers and have been happy with the purchases.</li>
            <li> I bought this to be able to have my own dryer on a 3-week trip to Europe. I got the hotel maintenance person to bring me a screw driver, as I&#x27;d forgotten to change the setting to 220 before I left home.  He changed it for me, but the first time I used it it &amp;#34;blew&amp;#34; my adapter. I didn&#x27;t realize that&#x27;s what happened - I thought maybe I just had a bad adapter, so I borrowed my roommates adapter, and it &amp;#34;blew&amp;#34; that one too! I was going to bring it back and ask for my money back, but decided I needed to save weight in my luggage, so discarded it.  I obviously wasn&#x27;t pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is great. It folds up so its easy to pack and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in your bag when traveling, which is nice because my old dryer and diffuser took up way to much space!  It dries just as well as a drier half it&#x27;s size and unlike the another reviewer, I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it sucking hair into the fan.  I have very long, curly hair and this dryer works very well for my purposes.  I intended only to use it for travel but the day after it arrived, my old blow dryer started smoking so I had to get rid of it and start using this one.  Now I use it everyday, there&#x27;s no reason to buy a second one for home!&lt;br /&gt;There are only two things that would make this dryer better . . . a heat control setting-it only has one hot temperature and a cold shot button, and a retractable cord - the cord is really long and makes it just a little bigger when you wrap it up for storage or packing!  Otherwise, fabulous product . . . a great buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer to take while traveling in Italy.  You do need a plug adapter for the country you are visiting. The dryer has a screw that makes it very easy to switch 220/110. The hairdryer is light but has plenty of power.  It also folds for packing.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Small hair dryer that even becomes smaller when you fold the handle in, attachments that fit so they are not falling off onto my head while in use. This is will be so much easier to travel with!!</li>
            <li> Is handy and if you are looking for something to use daily, this is the one, works great. Simple and Neat design!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer when I changed stylists and she started straightening my hair. I didn&#x27;t know much about styling products so I tried this one out because of the price and the fact that it folds for travel. It works really well, works quickly for the size and is light enough for travel. I like it, simple and functional.</li>
            <li> ***Below is my original review. I am now editing it because it has only been 9 months and the dryer died on me. Regardless of how much something costs (this is very reasonably priced), an item should last longer than a year! I do not dry my hair every day, maybe 3-4 times a week. I suppose that if you are only using this for traveling purposes it would last longer. My husband took it apart to see if there was any way to repair but couldn&#x27;t find anything. It stopped working mid-dry with no sound/smell or anything to alert that it was toast.***    I think my only concern is that because I have long hair and this hair dryer is small the chances of my hair getting caught in the back of it are greater. Really, though, that is a slim chance if I&#x27;m awake enough to pay attention! I&#x27;ve been incredibly happy with this reasonably priced dryer, and am looking forward to the small amount of space it takes up on my next trip!</li>
            <li> It has stopped working after 8 uses of 3 minutes each. And since it has been more than 30 days since I had bought it, Amazon does not allow me to return it. What are my options? Contact the manufacturer? What else?</li>
            <li> Brought hairdryer to England and it did not work well with the different cycles.  Probably good for domestic travel but not so good for foreign travel.  The dryer got extremely hot and sounded unhappy.</li>
            <li> Great product with dual voltage to cater for travels outside US. Light and functional with hair attachment is a bonus,</li>
            <li> It broke after 2 years. Typical life span I guess.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realise it had US plug.  Upon using it with an adapter it sparked and stopped working.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what you need it to do and it&#x27;s compact.</li>
            <li> Date Purchased/Length of Ownership: May 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;| Pros |&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- 2 Heat/Speed Settings: High (Hot) &amp; Low (Warm)&lt;br /&gt;- Cold Shot feature&lt;br /&gt;- Dual Voltage: 250V &amp; 125V&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight: 530 g / 1.17 lb / 18.7 oz&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave fine hair frizzy&lt;br /&gt;- Concentrator attachment works well w/a round brush&lt;br /&gt;- Concentrator attachment clips on securely (&amp; doesn&#x27;t fly off during use)&lt;br /&gt;- Compact: Folds up to approximately 23 cm x 11 cm x 7.5 cm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;| Cons |&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- Weak hinge: Sometimes when I&#x27;m blowdrying w/my round brush &amp; pushing both together and upwards, the hinge will fail and the blowdryer will fold down in the middle of the stroke.  Doesn&#x27;t happen very often (&amp; only takes a second to fix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;Notes/Tips&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;- Unlike on the full-size version ([[ASIN:B000FS05VG Revlon RV544PKF]]), the cold-shot button depresses all the way down into the handle.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.  Works well and quickly.  Fine hair dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> Very basic for the price.</li>
            <li> Good dryer for international (different voltages and frequencies) use. Bought for use in British isles...live in US. Worked fine there although make SURE you change the voltage selector to 220 volt for countries that are that voltage (US is 110 volt). If you don&#x27;t and leave it on 120 you will probably burn it out quickly. My wife liked the diffuser and overall design. Would have been an extra star if they supplied a few plug adaptors. Note that it has a standard US plug so you MUST get an appropriate plug adaptor for the country you are visiting.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to use in Spain. I used the dryer her on US wattage and it was ok.  When in Spain I switched the wattage but it was still very loud and too hot.  Thankfully everywhere we stayed in Spain had hairdryers.  Many times hotel hairdryers don&#x27;t have nozzle attachments, that&#x27;s the reason I bought this...</li>
            <li> This product works properly. I don&#x27;t have any issues with it and as a hair dry, it does its work.  Nothing else, the price is right!</li>
            <li> I have had all of the expensive hair dryers and none have lasted, nor have they worked all that great. This is my second of this kind(the first one lasted about 10 years), and it lasts longer and works better than any of them.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.  It&#x27;s powerful, lightweight, travels well, and is easy to handle.  I wish it would last longer though.  I think I go through about 1 every year and a half.  But for the price it&#x27;s worth it.  I actually keep one as a backup in case the one I&#x27;m using burns out in the middle of a style.  I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel as it has the dual voltage.  I have not tried that as yet.  It is a compact dryer and dries my hair quickly.  I have fine hair so I use it on the low setting.</li>
            <li> Two heat settings and a cool set.  The folding handle is nice for travel storage.  I do not use the attachments.  Very happy with hairdryer.</li>
            <li> We own three of them in our household.  Favorite feature:  they fold up for storage and travel.  Dries hair relatively quickly and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  We had one burn out, but it was used every single day by two people for a couple years.  For the price, it could burn out every year and we would still think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This dual voltage dryer performed well on my trip to Italy, which is why I purchased it.  Even though the package directions said it couldn&#x27;t be used on the high setting when using the 220 current in Italy, I was able to use it with no problem.  I would recommend this dryer to anyone traveling or for everyday use.  If it had a retractable cord, it would be the perfect travel blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer with the two attachments,however, it is travel size which I didn&#x27;t know when I ordered it. being close to the holidays,it also took 4/5days instead of 2 to ship w Amazon prime membership.the dryer works great given its size so I will keep it.just know the dryer and attachments are smaller/travel size when purchasing</li>
            <li> Unfortunately , this dryer is very flawed. It works well when it works but I am on the second dryer in 1 year and it currently smells like it&#x27;s burning inside and something is vibrating. It was not dropped and there it has been &amp;#34;delinted&amp;#34;. Unfortunately, this product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> this is the hottest dryer I have ever used. It is very portable which is nice for traveling.  the low setting is all you really need, high is way too hot</li>
            <li> The size if perfect for traveling and compact.  The dryer works quickly and dries my shoulder length hair quickly.  Unfortunately the dryer heats up and is HOT to touch by the time I&#x27;m done and too hot to fold up sometimes.</li>
            <li> I was traveling to Africa and needed a true dual voltage ceramic dryer. I did a lot of research and arrived at this. This product is all it says it is. It is light weight, very good for traveling and every day use, has a screw by side to switch between 110/220 and it works perfect in both. I have used it in both America and Africa and it works great in both. Thanks Revlon. I highly recommend, it deserves 10 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, easy to use, priced right. Seems to do a good job blowing my thick, coarse hair straight. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Unreliable appearance - looks like a cheap toy. Too big and too heavy to travel with (plus very long cable and huge plug). Handle gets very warm while using, almost burn my hand. I regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> Its good. Small &amp; Compact. Perfect for travel. Power cord is not retractable!.That is the only concern. Its working good.</li>
            <li> I really like the power for a lite weight hair dryer.  I also like the fact that the handle folds, which makes it great for travel.</li>
            <li> It arrived as is product from the warehouse because of the broken box. But inside it is in brand new condition. I love how quiet it is and how quickly it dries my hair.A great product.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it said it was small but its really big. At least it has good power.</li>
            <li> Fantástico It works great in both the United States and abroad in Europe I am very pleased thank you much</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a few days.  This hair dryer is lighter, quieter, and the diffuser fits more securely than my last hair dryer.  Both the dryer and diffuser work well.  My hair is fine, not thick, and curly, and this dryer has enough heat to dry it adequately, altho I typically don&#x27;t dry my hair completely before I leave the house, to help minimize heat damage.  I didn&#x27;t choose the 5 star rating because I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to determine how well it will work over time.</li>
            <li> Perfect travel hair dryer with a diffuser</li>
            <li> Great travel blow dryer for use in the US.  It dorects the air so that your hair dries a d straightens faster.  It folds so it is easy to pack in a small carry on or checked bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it inter ational and used the converter and voltage regulater and could not get enought power to be effective.</li>
            <li> I purchased this travel dryer for a recent trip. It worked exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Good merchandise Thanks</li>
            <li> This felt very cheap, like a toy blow dryer, so I sent it back and got a conair instead.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a trip to Belgium and Germany so I wouldn&#x27;t need a converter.  Worked perfect in both countries and only needed the adapter plug.  There is a place on dryer to change it from US to Europe voltage.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for the past week in preparation for an extended trip, and it&#x27;s performed beautifully with drying times very close to what I achieve with my regular full-sized ionic ceramic dryer.  The handle folds smoothly against the barrel of the dryer to make the unit compact for travel, and the cord is long enough to give you a few feet of range space from the outlet if you&#x27;re the multi-tasking type.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for a work trip since the past few times I&#x27;ve traveled without a dryer, the crappy one at the hotel has literally shut off from being overheated halfway thru the drying process.  I own a professional level dryer at home and was trying to come up with a solution that would fit into carry-on luggage that was somewhat comparable.  I think this dryer lives up to that.  The dryer is very compact and lightweight, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.  It dried my hair about 80% as well as my pro dryer (and as well as, or better than, the cheaper full size dryer I had previously).  This is a really great product for the price.  The concentrator nozzle stays on well and is good quality (haven&#x27;t used the diffuser).  Great for travel when a full size dryer isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I really thought the ionic thing was just crazy, but it really makes a difference. While visiting family I borrowed my niece&#x27;s ionic ceramic dryer and I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice my hair came out. When I got home I tossed my old dryer and got this one. Then gave 2 as gifts. You&#x27;ll be happy with this if you purchase it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really awful product. I just got mine and burned on the first try! Do not recommend to spend money on it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a diffuser like your hairdresser uses, don&#x27;t buy this one.  It is not good.  These &amp;#34;finger&amp;#34; diffusers are supposed to lift hair while drying gently so that the hair&#x27;s curl is preserved.  This dryer&#x27;s low speed isn&#x27;t low.  The diffuser has holes so larger that the air isn&#x27;t gently spread.</li>
            <li> Perfect size &amp; weight for home and travel. It dries my hair in half the time of my previous hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Love the power, compact size and diffuser.  The only drawback is that it only has one heat setting.  Hope the high voltage is not a problem in Europe!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this dryer if you have curly hair! I bought this one specifically for the diffuser, however, if you dry your hair upside down or at an angle where your hair is on top on the dryer, it&#x27;ll suck up your hair and tear it out. I lost several big chunks this way. I normally use a Chi dryer and have never had this problem. Left this dryer in my hotel room on my first and last trip with it - wasn&#x27;t worth the extra luggage space.</li>
            <li> Pretty great hairdryer for the price</li>
            <li> Works great! I had meant to purchase a different model (with more bells and whistles) but this one has been very reliable!</li>
            <li> The dryer was great but the cord at the base is defective and started sparking. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of months. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Liked it until it stopped working out of nowhere 18 months after I bought it. Don&#x27;t even use it daily. Is that really the lifespan of a hair dryer these days???</li>
            <li> This is a good product for a good price. It works as it should. I have used it a lot. The price is reasonable. Only complaint is that I wonder if the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting is more like a medium just from comparing it to my previous hair dryer which has low, medium and high settings. If you are trying to dry your hair fast, that&#x27;s fine but for using the diffuser for curls, you don&#x27;t want your power to be too high...you want it to be gentle heat.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine and the price was right.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong hair dryer for a travel size.  My hair always takes forever to dry and this can do it in less than 30 minutes, which is a miracle for me.  I&#x27;ve had it for a while and it&#x27;s been working very well and hasn&#x27;t acted up at all.</li>
            <li> It was good for a few months...and then it STARTED ON FIRE! As I was using it a spark flew out of the bottom of the hair dryer, and then a LONG FLAME! It also blew out the outlet it was plugged into (our house is 4 years old so it is not an old outlet problem) so that will have to be replaced. I am thankful my daughter wasn&#x27;t using it, as I am sure she would have been burned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** BEWARE *** FIRE HAZARD ***</li>
            <li> Buttons toooo close change with any pressure</li>
            <li> Kind of low power but for it&#x27;s size it is a pretty good hairdryer.</li>
            <li> This item is definitely not dual voltage as stated, although i have tried it in the US and outside the US where it says it can still work and it broke. a few minutes after i started using it the metals inside the nozzle started to turn red and heat up, i could smell plastic burning and the material the dryer itself is made of is very cheap and weak. the plastic around the handle broke when i was trying to fold it. THIS IS AWFUL AND VERY POOR QUALITY SAVE YOUR MONEY AND PURCHASE A DIFFERENT BRAND FROM A DIFFERENT SELLER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely request a refund!</li>
            <li> No where in the description does it say it&#x27;s travel size. I have just used it once, so it&#x27;s performance is yet to be determined. If I knew it was travel size, I would not have bought it. But that&#x27;s just me :-).</li>
            <li> Amazing , I recommend it to every one with a curly hair .</li>
            <li> Worked fine at first but stopped working In under a year of ownership.  It now sounds like a chainsaw when running as opposed to a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly but emits a burning smell, which can&#x27;t be good for anyone&#x27;s hair. Returned it for a different travel dryer.</li>
            <li> I was not aware that I was purchasing a TRAVEL size dryer.  I was disappointed when I read on the box \\&quot;REVLON TRAVELER&#x27;S SPEED DRYER\\&quot; .  Only writing this so that you are aware that this is TRAVEL size.  The dryer performs okay if you don&#x27;t mind a lightweight model with a slightly cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer for several reasons: it is light weight and does not kill your arms after a drying session with very long hair; it is sturdy and does not draw too much power. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great. I travel to West Africa often and need the higher voltage. I have used it in the US, Central America, and West Africa with great results! The attachment is also great for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This thing works great.  I use it to fill my daughters Barbie Doll&#x27;s bounce house and it has not let us down.</li>
            <li> I liked my conair dryer but this one tops that one. It dries my hair even quicker and is easy to handle. I like the attachments which allow me to style my hair better.</li>
            <li> Arrived vary quickly, vary power which I need for my vary think hair, not complaining I am 64 a little loud, but a lot of power.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is just perfect with its size and the accessories.  I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I Love my blow dryer! I purchased it after reading the great reviews in a magazine. It was rated the best for home AND travel out of 10 of the top selling blow dryers. It isn&#x27;t too hot, it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair. I like the attachments. It doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The adjustable heat actually works!! And that&#x27;s a hard thing to say about many hair dryers - it&#x27;s the perfect compliment to all bathroom accessories.</li>
            <li> I got this dryer because it was the one smaller-sized dryer that has a curling diffuser to match.  It works well, and it is conveniently-sized.  I use it at home and on the road.</li>
            <li> We needed a travel hair dryer and this one has the dual wattage which makes it very easy to switch back and forth as necessary.  I like that the handle folds down so it takes up less space.  Also, the cord seems to be a little longer than on some other hair dryers which came in handy on some occasions.</li>
            <li> I just bought this hair dryer to replace an ancient one, and I have to honestly say that I think I like it. Here is why: I have mid-length hair, so static is an important issue. I bought this dryer because it says it is Ionic, but is it? My hair still gets static and I struggle with the fly away strands. Also the handle, which is supposed to fold back neatly for travel, rattles in your hand a little and it makes you feel that the hair dryer is about to fall apart as you are using it. But there are some good features, as well.  The air flow is nice and smooth, not too hot, the hair drys quickly, the unit is not too noisy, nor too heavy in your hand, and the hair is nice and shiny at the end. So I&#x27;m giving it a 4-. But I still wish it stopped the static as advertised.</li>
            <li> ONE YEAR LATER -----&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the US and Canada, I&#x27;ve taken this dryer to England, Africa, Switzerland and Italy this year, over about 15 overseas trips. It is, arguably, loud (think jetliner at takeoff), but it&#x27;s nearly as good as my Babyliss Pro TT. I wouldn&#x27;t use it at home (way too loud and not as powerful), but it&#x27;s half the weight and works 85% as well as the Babyliss - perfect for an international carry-on suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing this, but this little Revlon dryer seems to work every bit as well as my $100+, full-sized Babyliss dryer. Same wattage, same specs (so it seems). Used in the US with great results. If it performs as well overseas, I&#x27;ll be in heaven.</li>
            <li> Ordered it and got it right away from Amazon.  I love this service.  The dryer works fine, does what its supposed to do, and my wife is happy with it.  I bought two so that she could have one to travel with.</li>
            <li> A powerful tool for such a small size! I love this hairdryer because it&#x27;s compact and dries my hair really, really quickly. There are only two settings - high and low, and a cool button. It&#x27;s nice that the dryer comes with two different heads, but I don&#x27;t really use them - especially the diffuser. Though the diffuser is supposed to dry your hair frizz-free, it takes about x15 as long and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the cool button completely diminishes the blowdryer&#x27;s force. I like having fast, intense cold air to dry my hair, but this dryer&#x27;s cold button really is like a &amp;#34;cool + low&amp;#34; button.</li>
            <li> Not a bad hair dryer - worked well not too many fly away&#x27;s.  Not as happy as I am with my full size dryer but is lightweight the high speed setting did not cause issues in Germany, but I was careful not to keep it on that setting for longer than 10min at a time.  Switched back and forth between high and low and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer-- great size for traveling and for everyday use at home.&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight and folds for easy storage. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST blow dryer. It&#x27;s extremely lightweight, compact enough for small drawers and luggage, very powerful and perfect for styling long hair quickly. Very good investment.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this. After two weeks of usage it stopped working. Spend a little more and get a better deal. I guess it&#x27;s true you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Works great, just like a full size dryer but much lighter</li>
            <li> The ladies of the house really like this dryer. It&#x27;s lightweight yet powerful and portable even with a power cord attached. This was a replacement for the same model that &#x27;the ladies&#x27; have used for over 10 years until a one-day-inattentiveness broke the folding handle. I glued it and cleaned the filter. It works well except for folding the handle making it less useful for traveling. All-in-all, I&#x27;d say this product is a good deal.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune if buying. It takes about 45 minutes before it actually gets hot enough to dry hair, but only lasts for 3 seconds before it shoots cold air out for a while before it warms back up again. It takes almost an hour to dry my hair with this tool, and my naturally straight hair is only to about 3 inches below my shoulders (so not super long). Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s a waste of money and especially time in the morning b</li>
            <li> Sister loved this.gift did not feel cheap.  Would recommend for a gift for any family member, great price great product.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality</li>
            <li> This is a great travel hairdryer.  The Ionic feature is a very important reason why I chose this model.  It is also very light, has a concentrator, and has high and low speeds.  The speed reduces to the lower speed when using the cold shot button.  This is OK, but would have liked for it to stay on high speed when I push that button.  Very easy to change the voltage on the handle when travelling.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Love this! Just what I was expecting and love that the in dual voltage really works!</li>
            <li> it works very good. double voltage swith is very usefull. but the plug is a little bit different from the ones in China. it took me 5mins to grind.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  This is my second one.  It is a perfect size, not too large and not too small, and it has two speeds.  It also folds to make it easier to take along on trips.  I use the diffuser most of the time, but it&#x27;s nice to have a concentrator.</li>
            <li> When one dies, I always get this to replace. Works like the big ones and travels well.</li>
            <li> As described..arrived on time..just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this dryer is why does the cool shot function has to operate at a lower output even when the high setting were selected. Otherwise, this is [THE] perfect dryer as it looks cool, perfectly balance and comfortable in your hand, has all the latest dryer gizmo, it is powerful and feather light by weight and on your pocket. I&#x27;ve tried several other models before settling with this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase. It&#x27;s well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly and folds up nicely for travel.</li>
            <li> Foldable, lightweight, and great for curls!! Packs wonderfully in a suitcase and I also bought my arthritic grandma one and she loves how lightweight it is!!</li>
            <li> I bought it specifically because it was supposed to be dual voltage, however I could not get it to work for me in Australia, and I did change the voltage on the dryer. I was in Australia for just under a month and unfortunately for me I was two days late for the return cutoff. The dryer does seem powerful although it has only two settings.</li>
            <li> I have very long loose curly hair.  Normal texture but a lot of it.  Did not think this would dry my hair as straight as my Solano but it does!!!!  I purchased this to use when I stay in Switzerland &amp; am very happy with the results.  Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for use while in Europe. I chose this model because it was highly reviewed and it comes with the the diffuser which allows for variety of styling with my hair.  I was not disappointed. The dryer is compact with a folding handle, dual voltage and diffuser.  The little dryer did the job. My traveling companion even asked to use this dryer because its wattage dries her hair faster than hers or those provided by hotels. Highly recommended dryer for domestic or international travel.</li>
            <li> Pathetic! Did not work at all overseas!</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer to have a spare.  I got this exact one for Christmas several years ago it is still going strong but one day it will die and I wanted to have another one just like it.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my hand and is perfect for travel. Wore out the first and am now on my second.</li>
            <li> The product is light weight and great for traveling. The small size makes it ideal for holding and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Dries hair in less than 5 minuets, I am a very busy person so this is a big plus. It is light weight &amp; easy to maneuver a great little dryer at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great attachments..folds up super small and compact...low setting is just right for my fine hair and the hot setting is good also.  Love that is has the cold blast option too..</li>
            <li> This little dryer is a dynamo....it is exactly as described. Features two attachments, a lint filter cover. It is small and light and folds in half for easy storage for travel. Love this dryer!!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it was exactly what I was looking for. I recomend anyone wanting good deals and cannot find them anywhere go to amazom . They always have what you want , and ship really fast.I also shop online because I am elderly and everything comes right at my door without carrying alot around which I cannot do. It is faster that I can go get it in my car and wearing myself out.</li>
