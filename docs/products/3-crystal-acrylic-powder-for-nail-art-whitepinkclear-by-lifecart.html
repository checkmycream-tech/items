            <li>It has been good to use in Practicing</li>
            <li>Nice for mixing and making custom acrylics.</li>
            <li>I liked the powder and the variety of these powders</li>
            <li>so I applyed more liquid to the nail  </li>

            <li> I really havent used all of them but so far I like what I see! they work pretty good I like to play them and it works really good</li>
            <li> Nice for mixing and making custom acrylics.</li>
            <li> I do not do nails  but I have done mines once before but its been a while. So I decided to do my girls nails along with a great nail drill I purchased.  I had to buy to buy some acrylic liquid &amp; began to apply them to my daughters nails &amp; it did not fall of the nail brush like suppose it was hanging like syrup &amp; was very tacky &amp; sticky &amp; in thought it was just me so I applyed more liquid to the nail  then more powder &amp; no good? So I tried the other jars &amp; the same thing happened. I was so upset I was waiting for this fun moment which was now a big turn off but I didn&#x27;t stop there I just bought more acrylic from the beauty supply store and got a great perfect nail. No tackiness  and the nail will harden very quickly soon as applied. My 23 month old poured the all out and boy was I happy. No one deserves to spend their money on bull s*** really. WASTE OF MONEY DO NOT BUY OR YOU WILL BE FRUSTRATED , FURIOUS AND UPSET....LOL</li>
            <li> I like the powder. Works great for the nails.The only thing is when it arrived the powder was everywhere. I guess one had opened a little. I felt a little cheated. But other than that it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> ARRIVED ON TIME.  HAD TO BE PLACED IN SAND WICH BAG BECAUSE THE ACRYLIC IS SO FINE IT SEEPS THROUGH SOMEHOW. ITS LIKE EVERYWHERE AND ALL OVER THE PLACE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product the only Problem with it is that the containers are way too small.. I think I paid more than I got</li>
            <li> i dont like it because its to small the price for them its perfect but if you take the top of it fall out and you dont get the amount that it gives you  its half if you poke something in side it shows the product dosent go all the way down. also the pink its sheer and the also the white the only one i like is the clear one.</li>
            <li> Love this item very  good price. Brings verities small but def worth it at least that&#x27;s what I think .</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL BUT THE CONTAINER IS WAY TOOOOOOO SMALL FOR THE AMOUNT I PAID I WIL NOT BE PURCHASING THIS SPECIFIC ITEM AGAIN</li>
            <li> I bought this when it clearly says acrylic and they sent me UV Gel which I don&#x27;t have the products for. I wanted acrylic. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Love the product but havnt use it yet Because I will be going to school this fall to learn how to use this product</li>
            <li> Jars were so small i could only do 3 full sets and one jar was gone :( They look so much</li>
            <li> But this for my wife and she really like it</li>
            <li> Very small containers.</li>
            <li> i thought the jar was going to be full but is just have way. that is why I gave it a 3</li>
            <li> This&lt;br /&gt;product does not lay right . Could be better. Its does not serve its purpose. This is for beginners that&#x27;s just starting off.</li>
            <li> I liked the powder and the variety of these powders but they were very small just like the other reviews say. not only that but I don&#x27;t think they even fill up half of that very small container but the product its self if ok</li>
            <li> gee wiz ive waited and waited for my powders and I never got them where in the heck is my stuff</li>
            <li> It has been good to use in Practicing but I am looking forward to getting better acrylic</li>
