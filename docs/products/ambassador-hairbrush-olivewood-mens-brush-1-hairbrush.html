            <li>We&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality brush.  </li>

            <li>Quality of bristles good.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>If you have medium body OR fine hair on top of your noggin, regardless of length or amplitude, you&#x27;ll be very satisfied and impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it looked online and</li>
            <li>He says that he has never had a brush as nice as this one.  </li>
            <li>In Germany\\&quot; for a nice &amp; welcomed change.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brush, feels great on the scalp and definitely does distribute the oils well.</li>
            <li>But the wood is very smooth and it&#x27;s shaped to be very comfortable when you hold it.</li>
            <li>My husband was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>While I hesitated at paying this much for a hairbrush, I&#x27;m quite happy I did.</li>
            <li>Since receiving this hairbrush, I&#x27;ve ordered two more for family.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>We also used to have a lot of such companies when we had more industrial prowess, basically owned and run by people who loved their products and made good ones.  </li>
            <li>This brush is perfect for my toddlers fly away, thin hair.</li>
            <li>It does a great job brushing as the bristles are relatively stiff yet feel great on my scalp.</li>
            <li>hair comb is easy with this brush.</li>
            <li>Fits easily in your hand.</li>
            <li>does just fine to smooth and finish.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s fortunate for me that he holds on to the things he cares about.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Solid, smooth, works well.</li>
            <li>This brush feels really good on the scalp and makes hair shiney and silky soft.  </li>
            <li>brush had not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this brush.</li>
            <li>The size of the brush is perfect for travel, does not take much space in a carry on; it has a compact rectangular head, also the right size for daily use at home, it fits in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a large brush since they&#x27;re harder to control, and this is perfect size for me</li>
            <li>Amazon made it easy to find and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Again,  I was super excited for this brush and did a lot of research before purchasing..</li>
            <li>Also, the size of this brush is perfect: not too small but convenient enough to fit nicely in a medium sized dopp kit.</li>
            <li>It has a good feel in my hand and overall appears to be a quality brush.</li>
            <li>Not bad of a brush.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say the old one is gone and he loves the new one.</li>
            <li>The brush is attractive and well made, and after months of use, I can say that it is holding up extremely well.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking to get one of these quickly, pay up for expedited shipping as mine</li>
            <li>I think it all depends on personal preference, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li>He likes the stiffness - his old brush was getting too soft - and it keep his hair looking nice!</li>
            <li>I originally got it for my toy poodle; he likes it so much he comes quickly for the brushing -- a thumbs up for him.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>He never gets rid of anything and has had his old one for probably about 10 years or more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size - small enough to store easily or to take on trips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine high quality hairbrush and by the way, it&#x27;s \\&quot;Made</li>
            <li>The bristles have that \\&quot;Goldilocks\\&quot; just right feel.</li>
            <li>The boar bristles are not too stiff and brushing my hair actually feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is more of a travel brush than a daily at-home brush.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as the picture on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you anything about why these bristles are more special than plain old nylon bristles, but it does seem to make my hair look nicer and brushing feels better also.</li>
            <li>The brush, although accurately described as 7&amp;#34; long, is also described as &amp;#34;...designed to comfortably fit any hand.&amp;#34;  Er, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly thick hair, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would be able to handle it.</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned that the bristles may be too hard on my scalp, since I have short fine hair, but the natural boar bristles made a difference, it was smooth on my scalp, and good for the hair.</li>
            <li>While it is very pretty in appearance, it lacks completely in effectiveness- it doesnt penetrate hair!</li>
            <li>My husband is very particular about hairbrushes and loves it.</li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s easy to grip using 3 fingers on the handle, my thumb on the side and my index finger on the back.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have large hands so this handle is just</li>
            <li>He will surely get at least that many years out of this new one if he will just take it out of the box and do the change over.  </li>
            <li>In fact, they give a nice little massage feel when you brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brush for kids, it&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>My husband is very concerned with the health of his hair, losing hair, etc.  </li>
            <li>and I even use it on my beard, although the bristles are almost too much for that.  </li>
            <li>The brush was too short for my hands to comfortably hold and use.  </li>
            <li>This is my first &#x27;adult&#x27; hairbrush, and the first one purchased just for myself.  </li>
            <li>I like the way the brush looked in the picture, more so than the other</li>
            <li>Very happy with this new Ambassador brush after the boar bristles on my old one started seriously falling out after 50 years of daily use - how&#x27;s that for quality!  </li>
            <li>The bristles are firm and feel good on the scalp, I enjoy using it everyday.     </li>
            <li>Much better than previous plastic/metal brush used.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it, and after trying it once, threw his old one away!  </li>
            <li>The previous brush also had an olivewood handle but again this one feels like it comes from a much older olive tree (which can live hundreds of years before they die) since though olivewood its density feels more like ebony, the density of which I&#x27;m familiar with from musical insruments, so it has an extremely solid feel in the hand.  </li>
            <li>The boar bristles feel like they&#x27;re from a slightly older boar since they&#x27;re just a tad stiffer than the old one, but not objectionably so.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, this firm uses only sustainable products and undergoes a yearly ethical audit under the EU of all its practices so, to vary the old canard, when you buy their products you not only do well for yourself but also do good.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I use it with my Swissco tortoise wide-toothed comb to get the big tangles out first.</li>
            <li>I am 6 feet tall with average size hands for someone my height, and this brush fits my hand comfortably.  </li>
            <li>At this point, I am pretty much repeating what has already been said by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>and I have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>This product really surprised me.  </li>
            <li>Also, the bristles feel like plastic instead of natural bristle.  </li>
            <li>Although it isn&#x27;t the least expensive option available, the brush is constructed with very high quality and was built to last many years!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that several of the bristles continue to fall out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not rough on it by any means.</li>
            <li>I believe anybody with a sensitive scalp will find the bristles to be just right when it comes to being firm enough to perform as a brush, but soft enough as not to cause pain or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just a brush, but the bristles feel much nicer than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Gemany&#x27;s product superiority is largely built on middle size companies like this (the &amp;#34;mittelstanden&amp;#34;) often run by families who have acquired knowledge of their products over hundreds of years, and who are often financed by German state owned banks which help them to survive in hard times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too early to tell if this will have any long term effect on my hair</li>
            <li>I saw it was made by Burstenfabrick (missing umlaut over the &amp;#34;u&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>Too small for a grown man but might be okay for a small boy or young teenage boy.  </li>
            <li>This one is nearly an exact duplicate of the old one right down to the olivewood handle albeit a slight bit smaller but with 8 rows of bristles running parallel to the handle rather than the previous 7.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to pay this much for a hair brush</li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just a brush, but the bristles feel much nicer than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Gemany&#x27;s product superiority is largely built on middle size companies like this (the &amp;#34;mittelstanden&amp;#34;) often run by families who have acquired knowledge of their products over hundreds of years, and who are often financed by German state owned banks which help them to survive in hard times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too early to tell if this will have any long term effect on my hair</li>
            <li> I saw it was made by Burstenfabrick (missing umlaut over the &amp;#34;u&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> Too small for a grown man but might be okay for a small boy or young teenage boy.  </li>
            <li> This one is nearly an exact duplicate of the old one right down to the olivewood handle albeit a slight bit smaller but with 8 rows of bristles running parallel to the handle rather than the previous 7.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to pay this much for a hair brush</li>
            <li> Perhaps because i have relatively thick and long hair, but come on, this brush would not even get through the first layer of my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long but am glad I found and ordered this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had in the past, while the brush itself is reasonably sized.  </li>
            <li> I think this one will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of why some of the Ambassador brushes are more expensive than others, but at the time I bought this one, it was the most expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very long, straight, thick, oily hair and this brush</li>
            <li> While handle is small for a complete handle grip, works well with one finger on the flat wood surface when using the hairbrush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are long and stiff enough and spaced apart enough to get through my hair.</li>
            <li> the vampire capitalism of Wall Street replaced the family capitalism of old, many of these small firms and have been acquired, looted and often destroyed by Wall Street, so as an American it is sad and infuriating to see this,  but it makes one a little hopeful that this sort of firm still exists in many of our competitors where bankers haven&#x27;t purchased the government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchase a hairbrush sight unseen; my past hairbrushes were just common brushes I could find at one of the local department stores or pharmacy.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great brush.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> My husband was pleased with the product. It was a Christmas gift. Amazon made it easy to find and the price was right.</li>
            <li> While I hesitated at paying this much for a hairbrush, I&#x27;m quite happy I did. I was also worried about the stiffness, as my hair is getting thin and I have a sensitive scalp. Not to worry. The bristles have that \\&quot;Goldilocks\\&quot; just right feel. They are stiff enough to untangle hair, but not too hard. In fact, they give a nice little massage feel when you brush. The only negative is the handle is a little short. Great brush.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried when I ordered this brush since I have thinning hair and a receding hairline. Wow! The boar bristles are not too stiff and brushing my hair actually feels wonderful. I don&#x27;t have large hands so this handle is just right.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too early to tell if this will have any long term effect on my hair but I must say that I&#x27;m hopeful. Even if it doesn&#x27;t, just brushing my hair makes it look great.</li>
            <li> Only one bristle has fallen out after 1 week. Let&#x27;s hope that&#x27;s the only problem that this brush has. Thanks.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for quite a few brushes, I decided to go with the Ambassador... and it was a great choice! Although it isn&#x27;t the least expensive option available, the brush is constructed with very high quality and was built to last many years! The bristles are firm and feel good on the scalp, I enjoy using it everyday.     Also, the size of this brush is perfect: not too small but convenient enough to fit nicely in a medium sized dopp kit.</li>
            <li> I searched for days and days before making a decision on this boar-bristle brush. I think it all depends on personal preference, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with this one. I liked the way it looked online and the shape and size of the head, so I decided on this \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; brush although I&#x27;m a woman. I have very long, straight, thick, oily hair and this brush does just fine to smooth and finish. The bristles are long and stiff enough and spaced apart enough to get through my hair. I use it with my Swissco tortoise wide-toothed comb to get the big tangles out first. I actually like the small handle, but for others browsing brushes, just know the handle is just enough to hold in your hand. But the wood is very smooth and it&#x27;s shaped to be very comfortable when you hold it.</li>
            <li> Good brush, fits nicely in your hand, is well made and a pleasure to use. Would recommend it for short hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for my toddlers fly away, thin hair. I recommend this brush for kids, it&#x27;s gentle but actually brushes unlike some of those flimsy kid brushes. I like the aesthetics of it too, beautiful wood handle and it feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> Since receiving this hairbrush, I&#x27;ve ordered two more for family.  This brush feels really good on the scalp and makes hair shiney and silky soft.  The olive wood is a treat, the brush is beautifully made.  I originally got it for my toy poodle; he likes it so much he comes quickly for the brushing -- a thumbs up for him.  I follow the manufacturer&#x27;s suggestion of washing it with shampoo that I use on my hair, dry it thoroughly with a towel and then rub in a few drops of jojoba oil on the bristles and the wood to maintain it.</li>
            <li> After reading about other brushes, decided this was the one I wanted to order for my husband.  He absolutely loves it, and after trying it once, threw his old one away!  He says that he has never had a brush as nice as this one.  We are both happy with this wonderful brush, and (it isn&#x27;t made in China).</li>
            <li> My husband is very concerned with the health of his hair, losing hair, etc.  He was very happy with this brush, it makes his hair look thicker and doesn&#x27;t pull on his hair.  I even use it on my hair.  We&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality brush.  For the price this is a must buy!</li>
            <li> Several weeks after buying it as a gift for my dad&#x27;s birthday, he has no complaints. He likes the stiffness - his old brush was getting too soft - and it keep his hair looking nice!</li>
            <li> This is my first &#x27;adult&#x27; hairbrush, and the first one purchased just for myself.  I have used &#x27;whatever&#x27; was around, which was usually my wife&#x27;s or my daughters&#x27; hairbrushes.  I finally decided I was tired of using a Rapunzel hairbrush and searched reviews for a decent brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush had not disappointed.  I will agree with some others that the feel of the bristles takes some getting used to, but now that I&#x27;ve been using it a few months I really like it.  I recently started growing out my beard for a dramatic speaking role and I even use it on my beard, although the bristles are almost too much for that.  I have not noticed any bristle loss as of yet in my usage.  I am 6 feet tall with average size hands for someone my height, and this brush fits my hand comfortably.  I don&#x27;t hold it by the handle alone, but up onto the back a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush over your wife&#x27;s brush or the closest Disney princess brush lying around.</li>
            <li> hair comb is easy with this brush. Fits easily in your hand. I use it regularly and still no problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of why some of the Ambassador brushes are more expensive than others, but at the time I bought this one, it was the most expensive. I like the way the brush looked in the picture, more so than the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a brush, but the bristles feel much nicer than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I couldn&#x27;t tell you anything about why these bristles are more special than plain old nylon bristles, but it does seem to make my hair look nicer and brushing feels better also.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchase a hairbrush sight unseen; my past hairbrushes were just common brushes I could find at one of the local department stores or pharmacy.  The size of the brush is perfect for travel, does not take much space in a carry on; it has a compact rectangular head, also the right size for daily use at home, it fits in the medicine cabinet.  At first I was concerned that the bristles may be too hard on my scalp, since I have short fine hair, but the natural boar bristles made a difference, it was smooth on my scalp, and good for the hair.</li>
            <li> While handle is small for a complete handle grip, works well with one finger on the flat wood surface when using the hairbrush.  Much better than previous plastic/metal brush used.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this brush. However,  I was extremely disappointed when it arrived. While it is very pretty in appearance, it lacks completely in effectiveness- it doesnt penetrate hair! Perhaps because i have relatively thick and long hair, but come on, this brush would not even get through the first layer of my hair! Again,  I was super excited for this brush and did a lot of research before purchasing.. It just completely failed my expectations.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my husband.  He never gets rid of anything and has had his old one for probably about 10 years or more.  He will surely get at least that many years out of this new one if he will just take it out of the box and do the change over.  I guess it&#x27;s fortunate for me that he holds on to the things he cares about.  Otherwise, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be writing this review.</li>
            <li> Too small for a grown man but might be okay for a small boy or young teenage boy.  Probably good quality.</li>
            <li> Not bad of a brush. I&#x27;m surprised that several of the bristles continue to fall out. I&#x27;m not rough on it by any means. It has a good feel in my hand and overall appears to be a quality brush. I like it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality hairbrush and I was delighted to find it.  My husband is very particular about hairbrushes and loves it.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of this brush. The feel of the wood is a pleasure to hold and start the day with. The size is perfect for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> My husband has had the same brush for 35 years - I couldn&#x27;t convenience him to replace it until I finally found this on Amazon.  I am happy to say the old one is gone and he loves the new one.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush for his beard</li>
            <li> This product really surprised me.  The looks, quality construction, and the performance of the brush is excellent in my view.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick hair, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would be able to handle it. It&#x27;s a great brush, feels great on the scalp and definitely does distribute the oils well. It&#x27;s also well constructed and fairly well weighted.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid, smooth, works well. I think this one will last a LONG time. I recommend this</li>
            <li> Very happy with this new Ambassador brush after the boar bristles on my old one started seriously falling out after 50 years of daily use - how&#x27;s that for quality!  This one is nearly an exact duplicate of the old one right down to the olivewood handle albeit a slight bit smaller but with 8 rows of bristles running parallel to the handle rather than the previous 7.  The boar bristles feel like they&#x27;re from a slightly older boar since they&#x27;re just a tad stiffer than the old one, but not objectionably so.  Give your scalp good stimulation without pain but feels great.  The previous brush also had an olivewood handle but again this one feels like it comes from a much older olive tree (which can live hundreds of years before they die) since though olivewood its density feels more like ebony, the density of which I&#x27;m familiar with from musical insruments, so it has an extremely solid feel in the hand.  I don&#x27;t like a large brush since they&#x27;re harder to control, and this is perfect size for me, size would be great for a traveller, which I&#x27;m not.  Very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I looked at the box  I saw it was made by Burstenfabrick (missing umlaut over the &amp;#34;u&amp;#34;) Fallen in Todtnau, Glermany (in the Black Forest) so I looked at their website, and found the following.  The firm was founded by Franz Josef Fallen in 1827, so has been making brushes for 180 years, reaching 300 employees and run by the Fallen family until 1974 when it joined a larger industrial group, going bankrupt in 2005, and being taken over again by the Fallen family in 2006 which is now again running it.  Should one avoid brushes made between 1975 and 2005?  Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a universal industrial lesson here.  Gemany&#x27;s product superiority is largely built on middle size companies like this (the &amp;#34;mittelstanden&amp;#34;) often run by families who have acquired knowledge of their products over hundreds of years, and who are often financed by German state owned banks which help them to survive in hard times.  We also used to have a lot of such companies when we had more industrial prowess, basically owned and run by people who loved their products and made good ones.  But, in last 30 years or so, as anti-trust law became non-existent in this couintry and the vampire capitalism of Wall Street replaced the family capitalism of old, many of these small firms and have been acquired, looted and often destroyed by Wall Street, so as an American it is sad and infuriating to see this,  but it makes one a little hopeful that this sort of firm still exists in many of our competitors where bankers haven&#x27;t purchased the government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this firm uses only sustainable products and undergoes a yearly ethical audit under the EU of all its practices so, to vary the old canard, when you buy their products you not only do well for yourself but also do good.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to pay this much for a hair brush but I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s the perfect size - small enough to store easily or to take on trips. I find that it&#x27;s easy to grip using 3 fingers on the handle, my thumb on the side and my index finger on the back. It does a great job brushing as the bristles are relatively stiff yet feel great on my scalp. This is a replacement for a boar bristle brush I&#x27;ve had for over 30 years. I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long but am glad I found and ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to get one of these quickly, pay up for expedited shipping as mine took one day short of 2 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> The brush, although accurately described as 7&amp;#34; long, is also described as &amp;#34;...designed to comfortably fit any hand.&amp;#34;  Er, not so much.  The brush was too short for my hands to comfortably hold and use.  It is more of a travel brush than a daily at-home brush.  Also, the bristles feel like plastic instead of natural bristle.  Returned, awaiting refund from CBSelect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S: olivewood is beautiful, brush is a nice weight, good size for Dopp kits for travel.&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;S: too small for my hands, bristles too stiff and too sharp for me</li>
            <li> At this point, I am pretty much repeating what has already been said by other reviewers.  The brush is attractive and well made, and after months of use, I can say that it is holding up extremely well.  The handle is small compared to brushes and combs I&#x27;ve had in the past, while the brush itself is reasonably sized.  I believe anybody with a sensitive scalp will find the bristles to be just right when it comes to being firm enough to perform as a brush, but soft enough as not to cause pain or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find similar brushes for less money here on Amazon, for the small price difference I suggest you give the Ambassador a shot.</li>
            <li> If you have medium body OR fine hair on top of your noggin, regardless of length or amplitude, you&#x27;ll be very satisfied and impressed with this product. I purchased the olive wood handle (it also comes in oak) and it is beautifully crafted. It&#x27;s a fine high quality hairbrush and by the way, it&#x27;s \\&quot;Made In Germany\\&quot; for a nice &amp; welcomed change.</li>
            <li> Exactly as the picture on Amazon. Quality of bristles good.</li>
