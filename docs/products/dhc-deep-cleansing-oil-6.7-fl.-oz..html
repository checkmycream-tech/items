            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I have tried a cheaper alternative, and it just was not as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>So I searched around on Amazon and this looked good</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so good.  </li>
            <li>I would say as good as Earnest Lazlo</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>I was using the Shu Uemura Anti/Oxi Skin refining cleanser and loved it (still do) but will be switching to DHC now.</li>
            <li>I have loved this for years.  </li>
            <li>Really good.</li>
            <li>so the lack of scrubbing is also good for my face.  </li>
            <li>I use an additional product from my dermatologist afterwards, so I can&#x27;t say this gets everything off 100%, but it does a dang good job.</li>
            <li>All trace of makeup is gone, and my skin has never been this good.</li>
            <li>Paired with a really good moisturizer, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>good product, will recommend it to friends and</li>
            <li>This product is good for taking taking out the make up in just one step, though is not as good to take my mascara (not waterproof) out as it was the SHU UEMURA oil.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Price is also fair.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product through DHC and it is as good as everyone says.</li>
            <li>has replaced the costly she uemura oil for good.  </li>
            <li>I use this with My BHA and AHA and my skin has never looked so good.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it felt on my face, and I could feel the debris it was pulling out of my pores.</li>
            <li>, it is quite good replacement from Shu Uemura.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and it was soooo good, so I decided to re-purchase, when the product arrived</li>
            <li>After having my fair share with cleansing oils</li>
            <li>but does just as good a job at removing my make up and cleaning my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the best thing I have found to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li>very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Great DHC product, in fact this Oil is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff; great at removing make-up and moisturizing and softening.</li>
            <li>Cleans your face great love this oil will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for all skin types, even oily/combination skin like mine, and I can see myself using it for many years.  </li>
            <li>very satisfied with purchase and seller</li>
            <li>You will be very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The oil is great for oil cleansing and what I absolutely love about this product is..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just magical and great and I will probably use this to remove my makeup for the rest of my life.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased that I did.</li>

            <li>It works the best and the price is pretty good.</li>

            <li>I was at first taken aback by the oil consistency, but it works great!</li>
            <li>They work OK too, but for me, this original formula works best.</li>

            <li>, i now mix my own from jojoba oil, grape seed oil n olive oil, i think they even do a better job on my face!</li>
            <li>but it works amazing for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>It is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to see it available on Amazon.</li>

            <li>It leaves my skin feeling nice.</li>
            <li>This really cleans and feels wonderful after rinsing off and applying night cream.</li>
            <li>The best ever and very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>I also researched others now that oil is catching on in the States</li>
            <li>So I always stayed away from cosmetic products which contain any kind of oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Care kindly sent me a complementary bottle of DHC cleansing oil, but this one also is defective.  </li>
            <li>So it is a bit tricky to use but effectively cleanses skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your face parched.</li>
            <li>Nice cleaning oil that cuts through all the makeup grease and oil.</li>
            <li>This is really one of the best cleansers.  </li>
            <li>Speedy delivery, nice product.</li>
            <li>Washes off nicely with water.</li>
            <li>Then follow with your own cleanser and skin regimen afterwards.</li>
            <li>Nice to discover that I can purchase it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>i will use it all on its own if im lazy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best cleansing oil ever.</li>
            <li>This really is the best.</li>
            <li>and it just rinses away with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Apply warm water and work up an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly... I dont use it to remove makeup</li>
            <li>the massage for about 1 minute... rinse with warm water...</li>
            <li>I then jump in the shower and the oil emulsifies when I rinse my face with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Used samples received in the mail and liked this product immediately.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample in the mail and loved it so went online to find more.</li>
            <li>Then, I rinse with warm water.  </li>
            <li>on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>This is my highest holy grail product out of every skincare, makeup, cosmetic, shoe, purse, etc I own.</li>
            <li>One of the best oil cleansers for the price, and the packaging works very well to dispense the correct amount of product.</li>
            <li>Then rinse away with warm water.</li>
            <li>and it feels so nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>Then I use a washcloth with warm water to rinse.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin nice and moist.</li>
            <li>One pump of this and some warm water after massaging it in, and nothing is on.</li>
            <li>, yes I&#x27;d you use it on your eyes if for whatever reason you do own your eyes with it still on your eyes</li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I honestly don&#x27;t smell anything.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice cleanser.  </li>
            <li>but after I use it, my husband always tells me that my skin looks nice.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li>This has been popular for a reason.</li>
            <li>Then rinse with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for gentle, yet thorough makeup removal.</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of mascara and this gets it all off so easily and all the rest of my makeup so nicely!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so excited to try this cleansing oil, I&#x27;d heard a lot of great things about it.</li>
            <li>Great face wash that cleanly removes oil or silicon-based moisturizers and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This cleansing oil rinses completely clean in water! !  </li>
            <li>Thanks to creative and intelligent scientists!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Really love this and will buy more again!</li>

            <li>I continue to use this product faithfully....and the best recommendation I can give is that people are surprised to learn my age.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did because my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I use this wonderful cleansing oil along with my Olay Sensitive cloths.  </li>
            <li>I still use a separate eye makeup remover, although this product does an ok job on its own.</li>
            <li>It suitable for me to remove make up efficiently.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel so soft and look awesome!</li>
            <li>My Korean aunts told me to make sure to give myself a nice massage when taking off my makeup.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what makes it so much more effective at removing makeup.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous, cleans off make-up easily, feels great.</li>
            <li>This can easily remove all the make up including the water prove mascara!</li>

            <li>good purchase and get my skin clean</li>
            <li>waht can i say - wife is happy and life is happy - one of the daily routines of womens care</li>
            <li>- my skin looks fantastic – wrinkles are diminishing and skin tone is much more even and bright.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suitable for most skin types as my skin is combination and my mom&#x27;s is normal-to-dry.</li>
            <li>Now I know it foams up beautifully and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Great first step to any cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li>Great product that does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Boscia Makeup-Breakup Cool Cleansing Oil for about a year  and loved it until I found this.</li>
            <li>Pleasant light fragrance, easy to use, not at all oily or greasy, removes all makeup with one step.</li>
            <li>:) Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li>It takes off makeup easily, and unlike a lot of makeup removers, this doesn&#x27;t have any kind of chemical scent</li>
            <li>and it is excellent, does not dry or irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then I follow with a mild face wash and a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very good stuff ... removes all the make up effectively and does not dry my face.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to keep my face oil free for most of my life!  </li>
            <li>Many people believe that is you have oily skin</li>
            <li>and I love the result.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Why I love this:&lt;br /&gt;-Amazing</li>
            <li>I am glad to know Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>This product is simply the best for removing makeup without drying my skin.</li>
            <li>I flush appropriately.  </li>
            <li>I still love my coconut oil and continue to use depending on my make-up routine.  </li>
            <li>I know many people believe because it&#x27;s oil</li>
            <li>The touch of water after using it on face is magical.</li>
            <li>and I love the cleansing and moisturizing power of the oil.</li>
            <li>For waterproof mascara though, you&#x27;ll have to scrub a lot more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This time however, the product was a lot more oily</li>
            <li>and i had to stand under the shower while furiously rubbing my face just to get most of it off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure if this is the maker or the seller&#x27;s fault</li>
            <li>but this oil cleanser does not work any more.</li>
            <li>Love this cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>My most favourite cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>We tried so many products before.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I think you are paying more for the brand than quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it takes off makeup and cleanses in on step without drying</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>If you suffer from allergies to perfumes, dyes or have sensitive skin, this is an ideal product.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>Is it better than avocado oil?</li>
            <li>I was once in love with this cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>My face has become better since I stopped using this</li>
            <li>To those on the fence I say try it, it works great and really wish my skin had reacted better.</li>
            <li>Love DHC.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I can buy DHC products on Amazon Prime -</li>

            <li>My favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I need to use soap for sure to remove the oiliness.</li>
            <li>;  If this lot is defective, I guess it&#x27;s DHC&#x27;s fault, but since Olive Care is not officially authorized by DHC to sell their products, DHC would not be able to do anything about our purchases through Olive Care.</li>
            <li>I purchased this using a coupon that I bought from one of those daily email sites and have been very impressed.</li>
            <li>yet I also don&#x27;t feel like my skin/pores appear any better off since I started this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite cleanser.</li>

            <li>I had tons of clogged pores mostly blackheads that I have trying to get rid of for 8 months using salicylic acid and retina.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feel so much better after incorporating the DHC cleansing oil..</li>
            <li>my blackhead on my face is 80% better than 8 months ago.</li>
            <li>DHC removes makeup better than Boscia&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>But as I use it more and more, I notice my skin condition is better and better.</li>
            <li>Removes makeup better than any product I have used before (Mary Kay, Estee Lauder, Clinique).  </li>
            <li>Smells overwhelmingly like olive oil.</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>The Deep Cleansing Oil is awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful cleanser and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best makeup remover out there.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than three months with no issues.  </li>
            <li>Actually, my skin looks great!  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with all of my DHC products and will continue to purchase them-the cleansing oil is light and effective.</li>
            <li>I make sure that I rub lots of it over and below my eye-lashes and along my eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used most of the line.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and always wait until DHC puts it on sale to purchase a years supply.</li>
            <li>Overall wonderful product though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year and love the results I get from it.  </li>
            <li>Then make sure to rinse with water thoroughly to get it all off.</li>
            <li>Great product, really gets stubborn makeup off</li>
            <li>I have been using DHC cleansing oil for more than 4 years.</li>
            <li>I bought DHC oil from physical store before, and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I have used this product for well over a year now, and I really love it.</li>
            <li>Removes most of my makeup and/or sunscreen with one to two pumps of product.</li>
            <li>I love the way my face feels after cleaning with this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I just have to rub a bit more</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have to use more then</li>
            <li>Love it, recommend it.</li>
            <li>It works much better than a soap based cleanser.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use any more than that</li>
            <li>and I love the feeling it gives my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended it over and over for years and have converted many to the idea of putting oil on their face.  </li>
            <li>and I love it in the winter.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be better hydrating than this one.  </li>
            <li>It does not have mineral oil either, which I love.  </li>
            <li>I will order more from this shop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it again someday.n top of cleaning them every week, but this didn&#x27;t make the cystic acne stop.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love washing my face with this product.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, rinses off perfectly; best eye makeup remover; I follow up with facial soap.  </li>
            <li>Blocked my pore more than unblocked them.  </li>
            <li>It removes make up like magic.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else I&#x27;m pretty well amazed and pretty well impressed by this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this; I&#x27;m a believer now, too.</li>

            <li>My skin is better now and this is all I use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this followed by a toner every night for about two weeks now and my skin is looking better than it has in quite some time.</li>

            <li>I want to love this</li>

            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>

            <li>my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I used some cleansing before,but this one is my favorite...</li>
            <li>After I did more research I found that many (MANY)</li>
            <li>I suppose I fall into that category of many.</li>
            <li>I AM ENJOYING THIS PRODUCT, WORKS</li>

            <li>Is famous for taking off make-up so well, and I find it more effective than super high-end products like Laura Mercier and Shiseido.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>generally doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin very good.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling very clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling very clean, without any oily residue at all.</li>
            <li>My skin gets very clean and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer mentioned, the color is darker than it should be, it feels &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;, and it doesn&#x27;t wash off very cleanly.</li>
            <li>and I am in love with this product already.er compensates for the dryness by becoming overly oily and causes-</li>
            <li>It is pretty good at removing makeup though.</li>

            <li>This oil is so surprisingly unique!</li>
            <li>I am new to DHC line, but every product w DHC WAS TRULY GREAT.</li>

            <li>Sure enough, it is as good as I remember!</li>
            <li>I mainly use this because it removes eye makeup so effectively, so that is kind of a bummer.  </li>
            <li>Overall a very good product.  </li>
            <li>It is very good at removing mascara and washing my face at the same time.</li>
            <li>and this is the best reasonably priced, high quality cleanser I have found.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to see this product available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for removing makeup while leaving the skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>DHC has a monthly free catalog that has free samples in it!</li>
            <li>but it is not as that fantastic as many reviewers have claimed here.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and this is great for ANY type of skin.</li>
            <li>I know removing makeup is so much more important than putting on makeup..</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different by miles and for some it may not be the ideal product, but maybe it WILL work for you-</li>
            <li>Skin then over compensates for the dryness by becoming overly oily and causes-</li>

            <li>Natural and better for you!!</li>
            <li>I have used this for about 12 years, I have tried so many cleansers, always choosing the most natural, and this is # by far the very best</li>
            <li>It takes off eye makeup, even waterproof, so quickly and easily!</li>

            <li>I love it for cleaning off makeup, and with this alone my face is thoroughly clean...</li>
            <li>It removes mascara easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li>I use one pump (and that is generous), which rinses easily leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>and it comes off easily when you wash it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just not that easy to remove.</li>
            <li>But if you want truly clean, de-gunked skin, this with a cleanser does a better job than anything else I have ever used.</li>

            <li>The oil washes off easily and your skin is not oily afterwards.</li>
            <li>Also it washes off easily while taking off some of the dirt and residue on your face.</li>
            <li>I prefer removing my makeup using the oil, because it&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li>Easily removes all traces of dirt, grime, and makeup from my face.</li>
            <li>so I can extract it more easily at night when my face is clean.</li>

            <li>really good, I am using it on a day-to-day basis now.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to use your own facial cleanser after this.</li>
            <li>also let your skin smooth and so clean!</li>
            <li>Ok, ladies (in particular) - if you want perfectly beautiful skin that makes you look like a million bucks and years younger, with skin so incredibly silky soft and smooth - better than a baby&#x27;s butt, then this is what you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>but this is good for all-over the face cleanser, easy to use, no hard rubbing to do when removing makeup</li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s redness and general irritation as well as texture of my flesh has also greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>This face wash is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Just ordered a full bottle. :)</li>
            <li>I needed something that would take it off, but even more for when I wear a full face of makeup when I go out.  </li>
            <li>It is hands down the best cleanser that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is the best makeup remover cleanser hands down</li>
            <li>Seemed to do a fine job of cleaning, so kept using it.  </li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>Takes off the foundation and the eyeshadow just fine.  </li>
            <li>It easily removes my make up and leaves my skin smooth not oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more pleasant for me to use than most makeup removers and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I love the routine because it goes so quickly and effortlessly</li>
            <li>a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Luckily I know this product well, so I know the drill, but if you need directions or assurance this product meets  FDA standards you may want to contact the seller before you purchase!</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the DHC mild soap to go along with this.</li>
            <li>and I love how quickly it works.</li>
            <li>I wear light eye makeup so it works fine.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;method&amp;#34; takes a little bit of getting used to, but the outcome is the best.  </li>
            <li>It is the most gentle way to get ALL makeup off in a snap!!</li>
            <li>I used to think the little make up remover cloths were the best until I started using this product.</li>
            <li>Eye makeup remover + DHC deep cleansing oil + face wash &#x3D; beautiful clean face.  </li>
            <li>The product is wonderful removes 100% of my makeup, goes on my face smooth comes off with little effort.</li>
            <li>that is a HUGE boon.  </li>
            <li>Acutane changed my life and took away the really huge acne.</li>
            <li>Cleans make up off easy and leaves face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>But since the shipping was free here,i had to have it.</li>
            <li>And while I was applying toner I notice that there was still some residue make up on my face because my cotton swab was a light beige color from the foundation that the cleanser didn&#x27;t take out.</li>
            <li>Regardless of the type of make up (i.e. water proof), it does an amazing job of removing makeup efficiently and gently.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this after all the amazing reviews but was leery with the use of oil how it would make my skin react.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin silky smooth, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Great facial wash.</li>
            <li>Removes ALL makeup easily and leaves skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>And the seller of this item on Amazon is fantastic.</li>
            <li>DHC is a great Japanese skin care brand anything you buy from them is quality.</li>
            <li>breakout free in my life.</li>
            <li>will say, I got my husband to try it out since he saw me loving it so much.</li>
            <li>Switching to gentler products helped resolve the acne, but I was still oily and just never looked bright and clear.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different products to remove make up but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>so this sounded totally bizarre to me.</li>
            <li>In the morning a light non-soap cleanser or just water is all I need.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face so smooth.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>my face feels nice after the whole cleansing porcess...  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of use, my face was radiant and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but DHC is specifically a MAKEUP REMOVER which is so important.</li>
            <li>but it does a fabulous job!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for deep cleaning and softening - esp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic for removing sunscreen, which I wear every day, and makeup, which I seldom wear.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth after I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>I had great doubts about using oil as a cleaning agent, especially since I have combination skin.</li>
            <li>they all liked it so much they all bought bottles</li>
            <li>, I definitely like the feel of cleansing with oil, and this is a great starter price.</li>
            <li>DHC directs you to follow with a gentle soap and toner, but the cleansing oil is so effective that sometimes I finish with cotton pads and a witch hazel toner.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend anyone to try it out if they are looking for a great makeup remover.</li>
            <li>But if you are into pricey, then I would even take it further and get Lancome&#x27;s cleansing oil which is also great.</li>
            <li>This products gets my face squeakily clean easily, and is nondrying.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT TIPS TO FOLLOW -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Massage the oil into your skin, this includes eye makeup too, then rinse gently with washcloth and warm water.</li>
            <li>It rinses off with ease and leaves your face silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Removes make up, grime and leaves skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and he is so happy with the improvement in his acne and overall complexion.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S GREAT FOR A FACIAL MASSAGE.</li>
            <li>You do have to make sure you rub it good around the eyes to remove makeup, especially stubborn eyeliner, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li>Its quality is good for sensitive skin with a resonable price.</li>
            <li>Its a great, gentle cleanser that really takes off the toughest sunscreen and makeup.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin, but still I want to keep it clean!</li>
            <li>have acne prone fair skin, not easily burned in summer since I am olive toned albeit fair.</li>
            <li>Surely, it can&#x27;t be the oil clogging my pores and causing the breakouts because it&#x27;s all rinsed away cleanly, right?</li>
            <li>The oil wipes off beautifully and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel at all dry.</li>
            <li>It has a very light fragrance of lavender and smells very much like the products used at the spa.</li>
            <li>This is non-foaming but your skin feels very fresh.</li>
            <li>You will love this product, leaves your skin clean fresh and no oily finish.</li>
            <li>Love this product and you get a large bottle!</li>
            <li>This gets you clean while leaving you smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This product does not do any of those; it goes on smoothly and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a face wash that leaves your face so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>My face always comes away feeling clean and smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is getting so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>although perhaps it soaks into my skin more effectively than is generally the case.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using it with my exfoliating brush to really clean out my pores and skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean and smooth.  </li>

            <li>A cheaper and just as effective alternative is to use olive oil which is the main ingredient in this product.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and cleanses better than soap.</li>
            <li>but I love love love DHC Deep Cleansing Oil.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It cleans quite effectively, i used it as a make up remover, followed with a normal face wash afterward.</li>
            <li>It felt wonderful on my skin and left it feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Had heard about this product so was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>Worth its weight in gold &amp;#60;and price&amp;#62;!</li>
            <li>significantly.</li>
            <li>I needed to convince my daughters that this is the best makeup remover by buying them the small bottles -</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It is worth a try, and if you wear face makeup, it is a must!</li>
            <li>I originally got a sample of this and was hesitant to try it</li>
            <li>I love layered skin care regimens, so this is my first step at the end of my day.</li>
            <li>Then you wash it off with warm water, followed by a normal cleanser.</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>Alternatives I recommend to remove makeup with are: the Original Neutrogena Make-up Remover Cleansing Towelettes or the Proactiv Makeup Removing Towelettes, which I use to remove face makeup/suncreen (regardless of if it&#x27;s waterproof or not, and for waterproof mascara/eye makeup Lancome Bi-Facil or Clinique Take The Day Off.</li>
            <li>my original cleanser that I HAVE BEEN USING FOR YEARS</li>
            <li>Worth the cost!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty healthy eater and I&#x27;m all about the health benefits of olive oil, so rubbing this cleanser into my face feels so clean and</li>
            <li>you should not use oil to clean</li>
            <li>Great for women over 40 with papery dry skin or hormonal disorders like hypothyroidism.</li>

            <li>My skin feels great, neither dry nor oily.</li>

            <li>It rinses off cleanly leaving no residue without the need for scrubbing and rubbing.</li>
            <li>It is great for my dry skin(</li>

            <li>Once I discovered this product, I can&#x27;t use anything else to clean my face.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it says that the product rinses clean with water but does not.  </li>
            <li>You still do need moisturizing lotion, but the clean feeling just can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>am a person who takes good care of my skin with daily routines.</li>
            <li>I remembered the DHC deep cleansing oil from years ago, and was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years and it really takes off any types of makeup.</li>
            <li>Guessing I&#x27;m 6-8 weeks into regular use and about halfway through a bottle, so I&#x27;d consider it a good value given the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Use a good moisturizer to help with potential drying.</li>
            <li>I really thought I was going to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Now, I use makeup remover sheets, so much easier and better for my face.  </li>
            <li>Now the full size is part of their Christmas cache.</li>
            <li>Not straying from the tried and true again.  </li>
            <li>I find this cleansing oil very drying, and it might even be better for an oilier complexion than mine.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>After reading such good reviews, I decided to splurge and try this product</li>
            <li>All you can really do is try it for yourself :)</li>
            <li>I cleaned all my brushes very thoroughly and kept on top of cleaning them every week, but this didn&#x27;t make the cystic acne stop.</li>
            <li>but I think this product cleanses a bit more thoroughly while still remaining gentle.</li>
            <li>Price of the DHC product is quite good, especially compared to Korean/Japanese products.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the best way to use this for my skin is first to pump one long pump into my palms, rub my hands together to spread the oil and warm it up, and then apply to my dry face.  </li>
            <li>Had I opted to spend twice as much on DHC products (easy to do)shipping would have been free.</li>
            <li>I now know that the more gentile you treat your skin with good quality products, like this oil, the less oil your skin will produce trying to hydrate itself.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this product really gives a deep clean as well as great moisturization.</li>
            <li>Plus, the color is more green than light green/yellow, which makes me think even more that it may have been tampered/compromised ....not satisfied at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like this stuff cleanses your face pretty well because my face feels smooth and squeaky clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin very clean without drying much.</li>
            <li>In addition to having fair, sensitive skin, I have wrinkles and large pores.  </li>
            <li>Face feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years along with Mild Soap for makeup removal.</li>
            <li>I really love this, and am glad I gave it a second chance!</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with their Mild soap.</li>
            <li>For the 1st time in my life, I was suffering from a mild eczema.  </li>
            <li>Have priced it out for the travel sizes, and looks like the big bottle is the best value, and the travel size they sell doesn&#x27;t have a pump, so I&#x27;m buying some dropping bottles to fill from the big bottle for my travel and gym bag.  </li>
            <li>It also removes all make-up quickly and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and find it to be the best thing to use to loosen the sunscreen on my face prior to washing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between this oil versus regular olive oil, but this deep cleansing oil is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I tend to tear up when I laugh, so I absolutely have to wear waterproof eye makeup which can be challenging to get off.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes me feel like I am winning against my skin problems as well as making sure my skin is moisturized enough</li>
            <li>Well, I get about three days where this stuff is great, but then it seems like after that my skin gets real oily and gross.</li>
            <li>DHC also has a huge drive for natural and safe products that are not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>it can remove the make-up quickly and completely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Best!&lt;br /&gt;Cleans &amp; leaves your skin feeling super</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t take any acne medications orally as I am trying to get pregnant and treat my body like its pregnant in preparation.</li>
            <li>With older skin, dryness now is more of an issue than it used to be</li>
            <li>and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>company is super generous with sample.</li>
            <li>And, it is super oily.</li>
            <li>Either #1 - they have super, super oily acne-prone skin and/or</li>
            <li>Odorless, mild, yet melts away make-up including waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Being a huge proponent for organic and natural living, I love the idea of not cleaning my skin with bubbles, namely sodium laurel sulfates and petroleum derived petrochemicals, fragrances, and parabens.</li>
            <li>but I love using this at the end of the day; it just makes my pores feel cleaned, and my face gets soft and smooth every time.</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased this because I use the Proactiv system (which I love</li>
            <li>Received product quickly.</li>
            <li>Like the pump, just two quick squirts is all you need.</li>
            <li>DHC is amazing with free samples as well, you get free samples every single month in their catalog.</li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It works like a dream, foams up a little with the application of water, rinses away clean, and leaves my skin so soft and clean that it feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I follow up with an acne wash just in case, and I tend to save this stuff for only when I&#x27;m removing makeup since it&#x27;s a pricey, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>but this is fantastic for a first go makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I have tried other cleansing oils but never found one I liked better.  </li>
            <li>but the shipping was free and lightning fast!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Wife bought this and LOVED it, we live use to live in Cali and when we moved to AZ she could not find anything for the dryness here.  </li>
            <li>Just apply a small quantity onto dry face, massage around (especially good for eye makeup removal) then rinse off in shower or with a washcloth and warm water.</li>
            <li>Even though I love dhc oil I still like to rotate products on occasion to test new things</li>
            <li>No more dry skin, or oily skin for that matter: just clean, pleasant, supple, completely happy skin.</li>
            <li>Its fast, its easy and my skin likes it.</li>
            <li>it will not dry you out &amp; you wont get any kind of reaction.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant about using it because of the whole oil aspect of it, but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>cleansing oil is thicker than the shu uemura but clears out easily with water and leaves the skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this oil; it makes my skin very soft after rinsing.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser for my very sensitive and outbreak-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job of breaking down and removing makeup and dirt without stripping your skins natural oils.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Keeps skin from drying out yet cleans deep pores more than you&#x27;d think!</li>
            <li>but it really does get all the make-up off!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the Mia brush with the sensitive brush head!</li>
            <li>Next time I will more than one thing !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been use DHC deep cleansing oil for over 4 years now, I love it!</li>
            <li>I need to wash the oil off my face more than 3 times with the facial foam, but the ones I have been using is not that oily and is easily washed off from my face.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Some others seem to have experienced the same thing as me, and I am pretty sure they got the same lot, which I think is &amp;#34;FFMTS(on</li>
            <li>Even caked on mascara comes off quickly and easily, leaving your face soft and clean.</li>
            <li>By doing all this you will minimize pores and fine lines and also make your skin feel very pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works pretty well and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>how good it cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out or leave it oily!</li>
            <li>Just pure unadulterated olive oil.  </li>
            <li>I also really enjoy the pure olive smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff works as well as other popular cleansing oils I&#x27;ve tried (MAC, Origins, Josie Maran), but I think my favorite thing is the pump (though you really only need a 1/2 pump at most), the fact that it has no smell, and it washes clean off.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as great but a little cheaper.</li>
            <li>Other have noted the scent, the hint of rosemary is pleasant.</li>
            <li>My face has never been so clean and clear, and so easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, have used for quite a few years.</li>
            <li>This deep cleansing oil is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>The bottle pump is also GREAT, it keeps things from getting messy.</li>
            <li>I use a real gentle cleanser after to wash the oil off.  </li>
            <li>I follow it up with a DHC cleanser and their amazing nighttime extra moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Deep Cleansing Oil for years and was so glad to see it available on Amazon now.  </li>
            <li>This is because I think this cleanser is worth my time, and impressive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but so worth it.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more natural like the LAVO brand</li>
            <li>DHC has most natural ingredients of all.</li>
            <li>It may be pricey but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>the price - I&#x27;ve never bought nice facial stuff in my life, so I was quite weary about whether it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this feeling, but I think it&#x27;s important to consider if this visual disturbs you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Removes stubborn eye makeup easily, leaves skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Esp like to rub it in and let it sit a minute while I get ready to get in the shower; don&#x27;t know if it does really anything more, just kinda feels like a mini ritual/treatment.  </li>
            <li>and I should have lovely clear skin again.</li>
            <li>Maybe because my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten more sensitive.</li>
            <li>You simply pump this into your hand and then rub it on your face and then wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I love how my face feels clean but not dry or irritated.</li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s worth a try for just about everyone.  </li>
            <li>I have also had blackheads in my nose since elementary school.</li>
            <li>Soft, dewy, lovely.</li>
            <li>wanted to share this because my mom, she rarely praises about things I purchase on Amazon x)</li>
            <li>Safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Takes off makeup and leaves skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>The best part is that even though this is an oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind.  </li>
            <li>Not much odor, good consistency.</li>
            <li>I love it because it takes make up completely</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth</li>
            <li>I love this product, it takes off my makeup without stripping it and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so incredible, and I&#x27;m definitely going to start buying this product regularly.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, though.</li>
            <li>I love the soft feel of my skin afterwards, I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li>ITS A NICE YELLOW TONE TO IT AND THINER THAN THE ONE FROM THIS SELLER.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Gets off all dirt and makeup easily and leaves skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>No artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels freshly scrubbed -</li>
            <li>I love using this cleanser with my favorite cleaning brush it really digs deep into the skin</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing it away, going to get a facial as a reset for my face and made my own blend of castor and sesame oils.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle but removes makeup quickly.</li>
            <li>First, just using straight olive oil made the olive oil smell too strong.</li>
            <li>Dissolves any makeup, washes off clean, makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>They are very customer friendly.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, product arrived in original packaging.</li>
            <li>DHC is a pretty fantastic brand and has some pretty stellar products.</li>
            <li>Cleans extremely well and is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>After using DHC cleanser together with other moisture product, my skin is in good condition.</li>
            <li>If you are someone who wears a good amount of face makeup on a regular basis, I highly recommend you to find a makeup remover that will efficiently take it all off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product right here on Amazon, after reading the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li>It is not oily and comes right off.  </li>
            <li>Right now its on sale until 3/31/11 at DHC for $21.00 for a 6.7 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>I was a fan of how it FELT right away.  </li>
            <li>even waterproof eye make up comes right off with this.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Just splash water on my face and the oil and make up rinse right off.</li>
            <li>Somehow, on my combo skin, it feels just right.</li>
            <li>Apply it right out of the bottle and massage it into your face.  </li>
            <li>Slathering oil onto my face just felt right, like this is how washing your face is supposed to feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t give up on the oil right away</li>
            <li>Non greasy, rinse right off.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I only splash luke warm water on my face and let it dry on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>This is a great make up remove and even though you may feel apprehensive at first about using oil to cleanse, I can guarantee that it makes your face feel just as clean as soap--which will actually strip your skin of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser hands down..</li>
            <li>The thought of putting a nice oil on my dry sensitive skin to clean it sounded wonderful, but there&#x27;s no lovely smell, just smells like olive oil, and it doesn&#x27;t take off my eye makeup very well at all.  </li>
            <li>Slippery to massage, rinses clean, understated smell, leaves my oily skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle for my face but clean very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to like it this much, but all the reviews are true.</li>
            <li>So happy to find I could purchase through Amazon and save a few dollars on it!</li>
            <li>Not sure about waterproof mascara but great for foundation, lipstick, sunscreen, et al.</li>
            <li>On most days, I don&#x27;t even have to use a separate eye makeup remover because it is both strong and gentle enough to get normal work eye-makeup off cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product for myself but did not have it long as my son decided he liked the cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clean and soft--especially good as we head into the harsh winter months!  </li>
            <li>good for clean makeup, heavy sun block!</li>
            <li>I love how it feels; it gets off your makeup quickly; it rinses easily; and it does not leave your face feeling tight.  </li>
            <li>Great item, very smooth, good for use it in cold, dry winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is certainly a 10!  </li>
            <li>feels amazing on the skin and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li>I have been using the deep cleansing oil for a few months now and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This never leaves a residue and removes completely and easily.</li>
            <li>Rub your hands together to warm the oil and apply to your dry face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The great thing about DHC is it doesn&#x27;t hurt you if you use it daily or several times a day.</li>
            <li>Goes on greasy, rinses off easily and completely.  </li>
            <li>You apply it to a dry face and rinse all of it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this for years and can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li>I am so impressed by how it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your face, it simply washes off with plain water...</li>
            <li>So gentle but entirely effective, removes every last trace of make-up and leaves skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>, however, I normally just use olive oil to clean my face..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thorough, removes all traces of makeup, rinses cleanly, &amp; leaves skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft, clean, and calm.</li>
            <li>And just noticing when I was using the restroom and caught myself in the mirror, nothing particularly dramatic, but that my skin just looked healthy and bright.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>On a scale o 1 - 10 mine would likely be a 7.5 - this DHC cleansing oil cleans the dirt and makeup off easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think I would like or use this product very much, but a friend insisted that I try a cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li>I am 26 now and I still get acne, not nearly as bad as in high school, but I&#x27;m always looking for the cure to take away my acne.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for stubborn hard to remove waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>Face is soft, but not yet convinced this is better than a high quality EVOO.</li>
            <li>my face doesnt feel tight and dry after washing it, and it is the best makeup remover ever!!</li>
            <li>You can notice the difference the first time &amp; others will compliment you on your complexion.</li>
            <li>I lOve DHC Deep cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>This really takes off all my makeup!</li>
            <li>When you first put it on your face it feels like oil (no smell)</li>
            <li>It was the first one I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just turned 40 and after one week my face is looking younger, brighter and more radiant.    </li>
            <li>it is my favorite deep cleaning oil.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Wash off with warm wet cloth.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for several years but had to order it from the manufacturer which took more time to come in.</li>
            <li>I use it to remove my makeup every day and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The magic of this stuff is only a dime size of oil does the trick.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying oil cleaning</li>
            <li>It makes my night routine so much easier!  </li>
            <li>I love DHC&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Oil.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product through a friend, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I still had my larger bottle to refill.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and travel with seem to deep clean and goes on smoothly really try to use it every night</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more convenient than pouring into a smaller bottle for travel.</li>
            <li>It works gently including washing off mascara!</li>
            <li>I had this as a sample at first and then got full-size bottle.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin - I never would have thought a cleansing OIL would be exactly what I&#x27;ve needed all these years.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve got the oil in my eyes before and nothing happened because it&#x27;s so light and natural)</li>
            <li>Always make sure I don&#x27;t run out and have a back up.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for the last 2 years, love it, it works.</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue!</li>
            <li>On a night out where I use a lot more makeup I apply and rinse a second time.</li>
            <li>pretty well I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>Leaving my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I started getting compliments on my skin for the first time in, like...</li>
            <li>Then I wash with my favorite facial wash and the sunscreen is thoroughly removed.</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I also love the smaller three pack for traveling.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in over 25 years that his has happened.</li>
            <li>Well that was my first reaction.</li>
            <li>EWG rates the ingredients as safe (I looked them up individually since the product isn&#x27;t rated yet).</li>
            <li>My favorite beauty product and the only one that hasn&#x27;t changed...</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom and she totally fell in love with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will most definitely order again.</li>
            <li>The cleansing oil is one of the first I ordered</li>
            <li>at first.  </li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>This oil works really well at cleansing my face of all make up without drying it out!</li>
            <li>If you read the back of the bottle of most cleansers they say they remove oil, &amp; dirt, they are not designed to remove makeup.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ordered this product from anywhere but the official DHC website.</li>
            <li>I use it when I have makeup on and also when I don&#x27;t; really god smell too!</li>
            <li>Also, there is no weird smell.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of DHC or it&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Oil, and as most acne sufferers I was petrified to try it as putting oil on combination acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>After only a week, my skin felt smoother and I think it looks better.  </li>
            <li>It becomes the first thing I&#x27;d love to do when I go back home.</li>
            <li>I read several reviews touting the glory of this stuff, so I went out and bought two bottles thinking I had found the magic for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love it since I started using it last year.</li>
            <li>My favorite product for several years.</li>
            <li>I have received free samples of this product in the past and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid DHC user.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this was the first time I did not have a break out.</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle!</li>
            <li>Love this over regular soaps!  </li>
            <li>I love DHC Deep Cleansing Oil.  </li>
            <li>Love it - only oil cleanser</li>
            <li>First cleanser that did not leave makeup on my towel when drying.</li>
            <li>wipe it off with a warm wet</li>
            <li>and I actually like it better, for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped so fast from Korea!</li>
            <li>After cleaning with a cleanser, face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Gets all of your make-up off the first time without leaving your face feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is a product I absolutely can&#x27;t do without!  </li>
            <li>Smells and feels exactly like the olive oil you find in your kitchen.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it really does remove makeup and mascara (of any genre)!  </li>
            <li>I simply need to get more info about the product&#x27;s ingredients to find out if I want to continue using it.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Have tried many others, but I always come back to this one - it even gently removes water-proof makeup!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling more moisturized afterward than regular facewash.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is the first skin care product that my 20 y. o. son has enthusiastically used every day</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>love the product and use is daily.</li>
            <li>This bottle will probably last me for a year or more.</li>
            <li>This is truly my first review on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so clean and soft after!</li>
            <li>Very effective in cleansing my face and is gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, effective and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this cleans off all the makeup and rinses right off.</li>
            <li>I love this product; it foams a little and then rinses off easily unlike pure olive oil.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin completely clean and clear.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin clear and clean.</li>
            <li>After you pat it dry, its clean and smooth, and its not drying.</li>
            <li>This stuff rinses off clean and leaves skin feeling soft and hydrated but not oily or sticky.</li>
            <li>After using it, my face feels clean, but not stripped of its natural moisture.  </li>
            <li>the sensation of rubbing oil on your face takes some getting used to, but the way it makes your skin feel SO SOFT and CLEAN...</li>
            <li>This product leaves my face feeling refreshingly clean but not &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; of all its natural oils.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Your face feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and really clean, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This cleansing oil leaves your face clean AND soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and soft afterward and NO oily residue.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and clean but not stripped of moisture after usage.</li>
            <li>There is some sort of ruddy residue left afterwards that I still have to wash my face with a cleanser, so I believe this is mostly good only as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle was more portable, though -- once you open it,  can&#x27;t really pack it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to find a makeup remover that takes off as much of your makeup as possible.</li>
            <li>Like, if someone touched my face I&#x27;d tell them to be careful with what else they touched before they &#x27; washed hands, so with that being said this stuff takes it off very easily.</li>
            <li>I was very scared &amp; hesitant to try this cleansing oil because I have very very oily skin.</li>
            <li>It removes the heaviest of mascara &amp; eye makeup &amp; makes your face feel clean but not tight.</li>
            <li>Face is clean but not tight with zero residue.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product to remove sunscreen and makeup and thought I would give this a try because of all the positive reviews...BIG mistake.</li>
            <li>When its first applied its very oily.</li>
            <li>(Also, you&#x27;re smearing The Enemy on your face which made me really hesitant and nervous at first.)  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve noticed my skin being and staying much softer and its so much easier to shave my face after using this!</li>
            <li>At first I was using this straight without water except for washing off...</li>
            <li>It arrived in 3 days as the promise, and it as good as the past.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, very little scent, a little goes a very long way, and all my makeup comes off with a good massage and a good rinse with water.  </li>
            <li>I find it a slight annoyance, but do find this product removes water proof mascara better than any product I&#x27;ve used (and done so in a quick manner).  </li>
            <li>This not only dissolves my makeup but leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh as well as pampered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I get acne due to clogged pores and skin-producing oil very easily.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other makeup removers but nothing works better, I would definitely recommend this product !!</li>
            <li>but once you add water it dissolves right away leaving to sticky oily residue - clean and supple skin only.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the OCM (Oil Cleansing Method - just a mix of oils right out of the pantry) and it was a no-go because it would not wash clean away and always left residue that DID clog my pores.</li>
            <li>If you use it right, clean it thoroughly afterward, you will definitely see how well it will work on your skin.</li>
            <li>I work it in, especially around my eyes, and then clean it off with a warm, wet washcloth.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow the instructions to use it on dry skin and then rinse off.</li>
            <li>This is so simple, moisturizes well, and washes off easily with water, which I did not expect.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it with dry hands, then rinse with water.</li>
            <li>Removes makeup and leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>, it cleans all the eyeliner, mascara and eye shadow mildly and completely.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I had my doubts about DHC Cleanser, since I have super sensitive skin and nothing seems to agree with it; that is until now.  </li>
            <li>I have super oily and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I also keep it by my sink and use one single drop to wash my hands after putting on BB cream or make-up that applies better by hand/fingertips than brush.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly  use it again.</li>
            <li>Pure olive oil will give you some resistance</li>
            <li>Not to mention it smells wonderful and leaves my mature skin without making it feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li>like this product out of the whole line and would recommend this as a starter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great starter oil with hundreds of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I wear waterproof mascara everyday and this oil leaves no residue, i&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>This product removes all makeup, including eye makeup easily, rinses off completely, and leaves the skin soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>It also feels like a more natural clean than a lot of other products.  </li>
            <li>You can easily write to them for a sample of the dhc deep cleansing oil and get a free sample if you are unsure of buying a big bottle.</li>
            <li>It felt a little filmy on my skin when I didn&#x27;t use face wash afterwards, so I don&#x27;t use it on its own.    </li>
            <li>Not only did it leave my pores squeeky clean (I have used masks, pore cleansers, nose strips that were just &amp;#34;o.k.&amp;#34;), but it melted off my waterproof mascara and gel liner like melted butter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey compared to making your own oil cleanser, but he really likes it and it makes his skin look glowy.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean and fresh with being overly dry.</li>
            <li>the purified Japanese oil gently and lightly suds and leaves no oily finish after rinsing.  </li>
            <li>My favourite part of using this is when I apply it on my face I can really feel the bits of dirt and flakes scrub away when I massage it around my face, it opens up the dirt in the pores and my face feels much smoother afterwards.</li>
            <li>It does work very well though.</li>
            <li>and here it is even cheap in china with the same qulity....</li>
            <li>This cleanser removes all traces of makeup, even mascara with gentle massaging and water.</li>
            <li>I then take my index fingers and rub horizontally over my lashes and eyes to really dissolve the mascara.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough to anyone looking for a gentle, yet unbelievably effective facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It really works well on mascara.</li>
            <li>This product is very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Every time you make a purchase at DHC, you can select 4 free samples from an extensive list of choices.</li>
            <li>then its much easier to use.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>Then I use a half-pump on my pointer fingers, and gently place them on my eyes; I let the oil sink in to remove stubborn mascara and eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>IT IS NOT GREASY BECAUSE IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE MUCH TO MOISTURIZE MY WHOLE FACE.  </li>
            <li>I use many diff ones and spent alot of money</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle and gets even the toughest makeup off.</li>
            <li>thank you so much.</li>
            <li>and I almost bought Shu Umera&#x27;s, but I couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much money on it.</li>
            <li>Because this really is oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does remove makeup very well.</li>
            <li>thanks so much.</li>
            <li>It removes all your makeup and really cleans and moisturizes your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had skin problems my whole life</li>
            <li>Can wash face as much as you like without drying out.  </li>
            <li>I use one pump on my whole face and swirl it around for a minute or two then rinse with water.</li>
            <li>It goes on like an oil, then when you add water turns to a gentle soap.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>my shipping is free and 2nd day delivery with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I do prefer the colors available from Cover Girl/Olay face makeup, but everything else I use on my skin, including the terrific lip cream, is made by DHC.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My skin feel clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>The price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>It is really oily.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using another face wash which is supposed to be gentle and hydrating.  </li>
            <li>This cleansing oil can remove the makeup very well, but my skin feels so oily after using it.</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up this bottle because of this breakout incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take too much to get my face</li>
            <li>Too much oil on your hands</li>
            <li>It removes eye make up but is really gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>so a gentle cleanser is what I need</li>
            <li>It gently removes EVERY trace of make-up, no scrubbing involved.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit steep in cost, but really clears off makeup</li>
            <li>I always follow it with a gentle cleanser to remove any traces of the oil and sunscreen and/or makeup.</li>
            <li>I have read absolutely every review on this product on amazon and all I could find via google.&lt;br</li>
            <li>research I&#x27;ve done makes so much sense I will share it with you:&lt;br /&gt;Oil</li>
            <li>I like the oil products, they really do the job.</li>
            <li>It also removed make-up really well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for 3 months and at this rate it will last at least 6 more months, so I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable priced product that does the job.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to try the Julep brand but couldn&#x27;t spend the money.  </li>
            <li>and I only wore light make up.</li>
            <li>It really cleans off all my makeup without overdrying my face.  </li>
            <li>So now, at night I use 2 pumps of DHC cleansing oil for 60 seconds, then I would wash with the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Foam Cleanser for 30 seconds and then apply my 1/2 pump of Cetaphil lotion.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet through.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to use a cleanser afterwards.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I use it as part of a multistep cleaning regimen, and it&#x27;s really helped improve my skins texture and reduced breakouts.</li>
            <li>Removes mineral and waterproof makeup very well.</li>
            <li>It really does what it promises to do.</li>
            <li>Does its job very well.</li>
            <li>Really cleans all my make up off</li>
            <li>It takes the make up off really well.</li>
            <li>your vision will be very blurry....</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a about a year - works very well.  </li>
            <li>With this, you really need to read the directions on how to use.  </li>
            <li>I like the way my face feels after using it - clean to the touch, but not greasy and not dry.  </li>
            <li>It depends on how prone you are to break-outs and how much $$ you want to spend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the real surprise is how fast this will remove all of your make up.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing after peels and retin A.</li>
            <li>Even when I got to my eyes, I just gently massaged  and I could feel my mascara falling apart.</li>
            <li>The oil gives me the needed moisture to keep my skin looking fresh and young.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have minimal ingredients (which I like), does what it is intended to do, &amp; more.  </li>
            <li>I think it takes off foundation very well and think it would work well for all kinds of skin.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE MY SKIN STILL IS VERY DAMAGE</li>
            <li>I recommend using steam/hot water and a washcloth to really remove it.</li>
            <li>I use it now when I need to take eye makeup off or am in a hurry to cleanse at night and don&#x27;t want to go through my whole routine.  </li>
            <li>reason I really recommend it is because it&#x27;s so gentles and doesn&#x27;t break out or irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Feel clean and not dry.</li>
            <li>but it works really to remove make up .</li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>Product shipped fast and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>Absolutely will always have this product in my arsenal of products to have on hand.</li>
            <li>I have skin on the drier side, but not too much.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely,i recommend this one to everyone who wants to have her up removal well-done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to rinse than the at home cleanser</li>
            <li>Extremely effective make up remover without being harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li>More often than not I find myself reaching for my Cetaphil, facial cleansing wipes or my Lush cleanser.</li>
            <li>You may think that oil will make you breakout more, but this takes off all of my makeup (including eye makeup), cleanses deeply, and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels baby soft after use and I believe overall my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>It also has a subtle herbal scent that&#x27;s really pleasant without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good as usual!</li>
            <li>It rinses right off and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>It took everything off including my waterproof mascara and left my skin soft and very clean.  </li>
            <li>It makes taking my makeup off after a long and tiring day SO easy.</li>
            <li>gentle enough and clean make up very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it washes away cleanly with warm water leaving no oily feeling behind.  </li>
            <li>It rinses completely, has no fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>this cleanser yanks make up right off your face, and it actually leaves your skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin that is prone to breakouts with most products I try.</li>
            <li>The Olive Oil moisturizer , the Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, the facial masks, Velvet Skin Coat.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip my skin like so many other products I have used.</li>
            <li>and this has helped control it better than any other product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this product.</li>
            <li>received a sample of this as most other folks who have reviewed have been introduced to the product.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other cleansers that make my skin look like I have rubbed it with sandpaper, but when I am done cleaning my skin with this product it looks like I have already put on my skin cream for the night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the original before, and the one I received looks and feels quite different.</li>
            <li>Soap will dry the skin further and your face will produce more oil!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Removes makeup, washes off clean and face feels soft but not tight and overdried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was not at all oily and my face was left squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and my pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li>I go pretty heavy on eye makeup and this is magical.  </li>
            <li>while it seems totally counterintuitive to use oil to clean your face, it WORKS</li>
            <li>Leaving my face clean for the next step in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>The result is that my face feels deeply clean and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li>This miraculously cleans my face of EVERYTHING yet rinses thoroughly clean when washed after with my facial cleansing.</li>
            <li>Not an exfoliator, but it leaves skin feeling refreshed and clean for your cleanser, toner, serum, whatever you&#x27;re going to do next.</li>
            <li>Every time I have makeup, even I only have BB cream on my face, I would use the DHC cleaning oil to clean my face.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra money to have a product that absolutely does not dry skin, yet rinses clean off afterward.</li>
            <li>The only things I dislike is that the pump dispenses a bit too much at a time, and I find that I end up using up the product quite quickly.</li>
            <li>The cleansing oil is mainly just to remove my makeup, but it&#x27;s probably not 100% necessary because the oil does make your skin feel squeaky clean after you rinse it off.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to remove even eye makeup, but leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Amazing that it&#x27;s an oil as I usually stay away from anything with &#x27;oil&#x27; in it.  </li>
            <li>the only problem may be the low capacity only 3 or 4 month for me, but it is good</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to disturb my skin&#x27;s moisture barrier too much; all I need is my normal night cream after I use it.</li>
            <li>Yes, DHC products are a bit expensive, but you get what you pay for and you can&#x27;t replace beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot live with out this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue trying new DHC products!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I feel like this product didn&#x27;t live up to the hype because I have found other products that work just as well or even better.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and this cleanser leaves it smooth and silky</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and not dry at all.</li>
            <li>The main ingredient is olive oil</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh with no harsh chemicals or perfumes.    </li>
            <li>I have been using the DHC oil for years and years and it has never broken me out, clogged my pores, or dried my skin more.</li>
            <li>Leaves me skin clean and soft (not dry).  </li>
            <li>The most recent face wash I started using was a generic brand of proactiv.</li>
            <li>After trying just about every cleanser out there, and still not finding anything that would help me get clear, acny free skin, I finally gave up and stopped using all the stuff I have been putting on my face.</li>
            <li>I have never found anything that does such a good job getting all of the make up off without being harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li>A must-have for ladies (and gents) who wear a classic pancake makeup face.</li>
            <li>Only con is that I feel like it runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>makeup off quickly and totally!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to older women -</li>
            <li>this gentile when I was in high school when I really needed it instead of all the super harsh chemicals I thought I needed to get my acne/ super oily skin to behave.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and fresh afterwards and NOT tight, oily or irritated.  </li>
            <li>The bottle has lasted me a long time, and one squirt is more than enough to cleanse your whole face.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend product and seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It removed every last drop of make up off my face, and left my skin feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I try other products when I get samples, but this is by far my favorite face cleanser.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to remove all make-up but gentle enough for taking off eye make-up.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, delicate, long lasting bottle of the most thorough, gentle cleanser ever.  </li>
            <li>gave it two stars because it really does deep clean and made my skin feel great after using it (especially compared to regular facial cleansers) minus the cysts of course.</li>
            <li>gave it two stars because it really does deep clean and made my skin feel great after using it (especially compared to regular facial cleansers) minus the cysts of course.</li>
            <li>(less costly) and maybe even attempt to make one on my own (2 parts castor, 1 part EVOO, teaspoon of essential oils such as tea tree, eucalyptus, sweet orange)</li>
            <li>Skin feels so soft!!  </li>
            <li>I wish it smelled a little better...</li>
            <li>right before I step in I pump 2 full pumps into my DRY hands, rub my hands together fast to kinda warm up the oil and then apply it to my DRY face and start rubbing small circles all around my face &amp; eye area</li>
            <li>You apply it dry, just rub it all over your face, and it rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, acne prone skin and sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I have used many kinds of facial cleansers and facial products from lower-priced drug store cleansers to expensive-department products, which are well liked by higher-end users, to a few Asian products.</li>
            <li>One is supposed to put it on dry face to clean all the make-up/dirty residues off.</li>
            <li>I was so confused when I first used this product because all the reviews were amazing</li>
            <li>this product really cleans but leaves your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>when I use it directly on dry clean and rub it around for about 15 seconds before washing off with water.</li>
            <li>Note to massage it directly onto your skin and not to use water until you are ready to rinse it off your face.</li>
            <li>but it is still gentle and does not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are so natural &amp; gentle</li>
            <li>To use, pump onto clean dry hands and rub all over your face.</li>
            <li>I have never stuck with any cleanser this long as most don&#x27;t work or only</li>
            <li>I have normal skin with an oily T-Zone.</li>
            <li>Then if I quit using it for a few days, it is quite lovely for another three days.</li>
            <li>This is better than any harsh makeup remover you could buy.</li>
            <li>I rarely get breakouts on my face, only 1 or two before/during my cycle)</li>
            <li>He has not complained and he has been satisified with the product.  </li>
            <li>I do wear the basic waterproof mascara, foundation, setting powder, etc, and using this as the first step of my cleaning process works very well.</li>
            <li>Most work well for a few weeks, sometimes a month or two, and then my skin becomes irritated and rosacea &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; prone.  </li>
            <li>use this product strictly as makeup remover, NOT as my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li>After that, I continue on with my normal skincare routine (cleanser, toner, moisturizer, spot treatment, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wash my face with my normal face wash</li>
            <li>I have normal skin and use every night.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Bosia (which you can buy at Ulta) is a little thicker, so it doesn&#x27;t spread and glide over your eye area as fast or easily as the DHC and for the price, the bottle is a lot</li>
            <li>After going through all my DHC catalog samples, I had to break down and finally buy this product because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I read several more reviews about this cleansing oil, turns out I massaged it on my face for too long and that was why my skin got irritated by all the circular massaging motion on my chin!</li>
            <li>I just finished off with a toner and my once lengthy makeup-removal routine was shortened by more than half the time!</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser  especially if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Really takes all make-up off very softly and leaving fade so soft and with a glow.</li>
            <li>I only need 1 or two pumps and it rinses right off.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that when I massage my face with this for a minute or two, tiny blackheads come right out.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate, and this makes a big difference, and also helps my moisturizers to work better.  </li>
            <li>It did seem a little strange, using a cleansing \\&quot;oil\\&quot; to clean the oily areas of my face which are prone to break-outs, but this formula is so light, rinses completely and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily feel, only clean softness.</li>
            <li>It removes make up very very well, won&#x27;t dry skin like most other foaming like cleaners.</li>
            <li>It took all my make up off and leaving my face squeaky clean, but not stripped dry!</li>
            <li>Awesome cleanser, the only small drawback is that it stings a little in the eyes, but I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>my original one has ABSOLUTELY NO RESIDUE</li>
            <li>I put a little on my hands, emulsified it between my fingers and started applying it directly to my face and my many layers of makeup just melted away.</li>
            <li>I usually use one pump straight on dry skin, and work it gently for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, and then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>and i can&#x27;t live without this now.</li>
            <li>and I can live with that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to oil cleansers and have tried this and Murad.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of natural oils and gets makeup off easily with a few rubs.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and it is just what I needed for my dry winter skin in Michigan.</li>
            <li>clean the face totally and not dry</li>
            <li>After rinsing, it&#x27;s important to wash with regular facial soap.</li>
            <li>normally use this as my first cleanser followed by a regular ph balanced cleanser&lt;br /&gt;sometimes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old and feel that most cleansers are too harsh.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, but that has not been as much as a problem as it was for me when I was younger - - as an actor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to have a deep facial cleanser to protect my skin.</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that my eye makeup doesn&#x27;t come off very easily</li>
            <li>very natural , no chemicals; my skin loves it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>It has a neutral olive smell, very gentle on the skin &amp; eyes, a bottle will last you 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Just leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li>I have in the past with adequate success</li>
            <li>it is not expensive, it lasts quite a while, and I cannot remember what I used before, but I know whatever it was, it left my face irritated - forgot to mention I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>SO SOFT AFT USING CLEANSER!</li>
            <li>I normally order directly from DHC because you get a loyalty customer discount and it helps.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time i have ordered from Amazon,so i have yet to see if the consistency is different or not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this as the first step in a double cleanse routine in the evening</li>
            <li>I have been buying it for  5 years direct from the company but ran out and needed it faster, thank goodness for prime!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I tried this product and fell in love with cleansing oils (once I discovered how they work, I tried several other brands).</li>
            <li>I use this as my first step in the double cleansing method.</li>
            <li>I used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li>is pretty simple.</li>
            <li>First step in Asian face care.</li>
            <li>It definitely cleans your face the first time and does not leave it oily and it keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of other facial cleansers, but this one is my favorite by far!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but with your normal oily T zone.</li>
            <li>It has also helped my &amp;#34;way too old to be getting&amp;#34; acne!</li>
            <li>This product excels as a first step in facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is only retailer that seems to stock it consistently.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have those raccoon eyes after washing anymore (despite heavy eyeliner usage) because this stuff really melts it all away clean.  </li>
            <li>The last time I purchased this product, it didn&#x27;t leave the same clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>The oil is really light with a thin consistency and washes cleanly off the face.</li>
            <li>It feels like such a deep clean</li>
            <li>If you wear light eye makeup this takes it right off but with heavy mascara (my guilty favorite!)</li>
            <li>I have always liked this product, however, this particular bottle I received recently has oil of which consistency, texture, color and smell are very different from my previously purchased ones.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that this one is imitation brand goods!!!</li>
            <li>I have pretty normal skin, and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the idea of an oil based cleanser was weird, but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It does not dry your skin and is really gentle on your eyes.</li>
            <li>As to the Deep Cleansing Oil itself, I like that it dissolves all of my make-up and is easy to use, but I (weirdly) find it a bit drying and need to moisturize and exfoliate more often than normal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She claimed that it really cleansed her face and did not dry her skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>First and only product I&#x27;ve ever used that has removed my make up completely.</li>
            <li>At night, I usually use a toner just to make sure all the makeup and anything else is completely washed off before using a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Have allergies to many products due to perfumes and other additives, this is pure and does not cause any discomfort or itching.  </li>
            <li>but my skin kind of changes into a little dry during fall and winter...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, have tried tone of skin care, so far no irritation on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cuts down on so many facial regiments.  </li>
            <li>I never knew a cleanser could make such a positive difference.</li>
            <li>I gave it a few weeks of consistent use, but my face broke out worse than I think I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever had and my face now in a better condition that it has been in the last half a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting used to putting this on my dry face with dry hands, but it cleans well, rinses off easily, and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft without the tightness that other cleansers cause.  </li>
            <li>you, its amazing at removing every last bit of makeup- sticky foundation, mascaras and every other strange thing we can put on our face.</li>
            <li>So the oil breaks down all your makeup &amp; dirt and this product rinses clean</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any change in general redness, but I would still highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I finally got a little better.</li>
            <li>Then I add water, massage a little more and then rinse it off and have ZERO traces of makeup left.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried a couple of DHC&#x27;s other formulas - a mild version and the pore cleanser.</li>
            <li>I think the DHC one is probably the best because of the size of the bottle in relation to the price, the natural low-odor scent (which is basically none, so you know it&#x27;s not loaded with crap chemicals),</li>
            <li>One pump of DHC is enough to get it all off - before washing my face at night, I rub it directly on my eyelids with my fingers without any water, rinse, then wash my whole face with face wash.</li>
            <li>like this product, the reason I got was because I read an article on Cosmo about how oil helps remove dirt and clear blackheads on your face.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks my face began to clear up.</li>
            <li>But then, after a few days of using the oil, I developed the largest, most painful cystic acne breakout I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>Can remove make-up clearly.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean (which is odd since this is oil).</li>
            <li>Clinque is clear and this is an olive oil color and smell.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin so soft and well prepped for a cleanser.</li>
            <li>your skin really soft</li>
            <li>Although the directions state not to apply directly to eyes, I have to chuckle, because I need to get my mascara off, and in the process, the product enters my eye.  </li>
            <li>It does the job on waterproof make-up and leaves your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Those with sensitive eyes or contact wearers may want to proceed with caution, but again, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with eye irritation.</li>
            <li>As a side note my skin is sensitive and I get headaches from overly scented products but have had no problems with this stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft that I almost don&#x27;t feel like I need to put lotion on afterwards</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It dissolves every trace of makeup completely.</li>
            <li>I can only use the gentlest cleansers and sometimes even the ones that are marketed as gentle sting when I put them on my skin.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, I follow up with a gentle face cleanser such as Cetaphil to thoroughly remove any leftover residue.</li>
            <li>It rinses completely off.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely come back again!</li>
            <li>with soft skin and no wrinkles...</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and am in my early 30s.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce]] to remove all the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then I use witch hazel as a toner, and then apply 100% all natural argan oil on my eyes, face, neck, and chest at night.</li>
            <li>This cleans my sensitive skin (Rosacea)</li>
            <li>This product completely cleanses my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Nothing I have used removes makeup and sunscreen so completely.</li>
            <li>It feels completely water soluable.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup (including the eye area) completely.  </li>
            <li>but it leave it soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It requires a follow up cleanser to really remove the last of the oily makeup residue.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>He has naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>and this does not increase the natural oil from my skin.</li>
            <li>Your face stays soft and the skin gets moisturized.  </li>
            <li>, I used to order directly from DHC, since I am a prime member</li>
            <li>without stripping my skin it gently removes all of the above stated</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Does the job of completely taking off my makeup.</li>
            <li>The deal breaker for me was I used it near my eyes to remove makeup it burned and irritated my eyes even after rinsing with water.  </li>
            <li>i use a gentle facial wash afterward...</li>
            <li>DHC has a product designed for moisturizing but as far as I can tell there&#x27;s no reason not to just use the cleansing oil for moisture as well,</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s Old Faithful for me.</li>
            <li>Leave my skin velvety soft and his not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Contains natural ingredients and works so well.  </li>
            <li>It cleans off the make-up and my skin has never felt so soft.  </li>
            <li>A week later, my skin is so much cleaner, acne is fading (even a spot that has been on my face for about a year) and my face looks radiant.</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old and have been using this for 2 years now.</li>
            <li>It really goes into the pores and helps with my daily exfoliation!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of it that I got in the mail and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>I am not a heavy makeup wearer, so I don&#x27;t know how well this would work for them.</li>
            <li>Make-up melts off, leaving my skin soft as silk.</li>
            <li>My sensitive, rosacea skin loves this product.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It removes all my makeup - face and eye, and after I use it my skin is soft and almost transluscent.  </li>
            <li>but it came completely off.</li>
            <li>It cleanses my face and eye make-up thoroughly, with ease, and leaves the face feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>have combination/oily and relatively sensitive skin and this does not break me out or irritate me at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well it worked, so I ordered here.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and I was worried this would just contribute to the excess oil, it did the opposite!</li>
            <li>It rinses completely.</li>
            <li>It completely removes mascara and makeup, it completely rinses away.</li>
            <li>By the end of the facial cleanse, it was like the oil had turned into an exfoliating scrub because it had pulled out so much gunk that the oil turned grainy.</li>
            <li>I find it a bit drying though for my 50+ year old skin.</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin types should use with caution.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>When I wash it off, the oil turns milky and my face is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>It completely removes all of my makeup including all waterproof eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it for mature skin also since you are not pulling on your skin during washing.</li>
            <li>I like the way this product leaves my skin soft and dewy looking.</li>
            <li>The initial feel of oil on my face is a bit disconcerting, but the oil really washes off with water.</li>
            <li>Apply directly to face (don&#x27;t add water until you have massaged it thoroughly into your face).  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Ok...I&#x27;m old.  </li>
            <li>and it always feels soft after.  </li>
            <li>The benefit is my skin feels velvety soft.  </li>
            <li>After trying a sample of DHC I knew that this product fixed my concerns with the homemade stuff.  </li>
            <li>Completely cleans your face and leaves no trace of makeup.</li>
            <li>this japanese oil remover I have used for several years, and it is useful for me.</li>
            <li>I really love all products purchased from this line - a bit expensive but well worth it</li>
            <li>This cleansing oil is similar to the Shu Uemura brand&#x27;s cleansing oil, but much more affordable for everyday use.</li>
            <li>and effectively made my acne worse.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is the first one I&#x27;ve found that actually leaves my skin feeling soft, not dry.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves my face feeling clean, but not squeaky and tight.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally, there will be some trace amounts of my makeup left on the cotton ball when I use toner, but it is significantly better than any other makeup remover I have used to date.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You massage it onto a dry face for a minute or two and then hold a steaming hot washcloth on your face.</li>
            <li>More expensive than a bar of soap, and much more long lasting, too.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and non irritating, leaving skin feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li>I used it before I hop in the shower:pump it once to get some product in my dry hand, gently spread it on my face, gently massage it into my face using circular motion, and I only do this for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>DHC does carry a small travel size pump bottle, but I find it&#x27;s more convenient to just carry the sample size packets on short business</li>
            <li>DHC Deep Cleansing Oil feels exactly like extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li>It removes my everyday makeup pretty much in one go.</li>
            <li>just ordered my first bottle because after finally using my sample last night- all of my 32 pimples but 1</li>
            <li>I have yet to find makeup that this product doesn&#x27;t completely remove - heavy eyeliner, longlasting lipstick, full coverage foundation, you name it.</li>
            <li>actually so does the main ingredient in this, which is olive oil.....</li>
            <li>This cleansing oil completely removes makeup the way no other product I have tried has.  </li>
            <li>but it rinses off my face completely leaving behind moist, fresh, CLEAN skin that is ready for my second cleanser to reach deep into</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right consistency where the other was too runny.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t know how easily it removes heavy foundations as I don&#x27;t wear beyond sheer coverage/tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>and I find my oil production is more balanced because other cleansers especially foaming ones dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Unlike plain olive oil, it emulsifies and rinses clean</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, I put a small amount of this product in my hand and then lightly massage it on my face and neck to cut the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Or if you order through DHC, you can get free sample-size packets which I usually save up for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combo dry/oily + sensitive skin and don&#x27;t wear makeup generally.</li>
            <li>This is my first time I spent the time to rate anything I have purchased online.</li>
            <li>arrived promptly, was exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li>only downside I have found is that the normal 6.7 oz.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just about the only thing that makes my 70 year old face feel young!  </li>
            <li>I wear makeup almost every day because I have a lot of acne scarring/acne that I&#x27;m not comfortable going out with without a full face of foundation/BB cream.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean off and afterwards my face is a bit tight, but not dry.</li>
            <li>Now, as far as it being an oil (olive oil based), it rinsed off thoroughly and quickly with just plain water.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>DHC can easily remove everything off without rubbing your eyes so hard.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without my DHC Deep Cleansing Oil!  </li>
            <li>Rub your hands together and gently massage onto your dry face.</li>
            <li>If you have dry or aging skin I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin this may be too drying for you, but it works very well on combination to oily</li>
            <li>Really works well to help problem areas of dry skin around my nose.  </li>
            <li>Deep cleansing provides the extra moisture with gentle cleansing.  </li>
            <li>oil cleanser was created to react with water when comes in contact to become a milky liquid which washes completely off skin, leaving skin soft at the same time (Not over-drying).</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>Your face feels so soft and never dry</li>
            <li>Used it once and couldn&#x27;t reorder my DHC Deep Cleansing Oil fast enough.  </li>
            <li>best gentle and nourishing cleanser: doesn&#x27;t have nasty mineral oil.</li>
            <li>Most reviews are good but some are terrible.  </li>
            <li>Feels very natural and organic, like a facial with every face wash.</li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive to eye makeup remover, but this product not only takes it all off but doesn&#x27;t sting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin no longer has oily and dry days, it&#x27;s all very normal.</li>
            <li>It removes make-up like no other.  </li>
            <li>It cleans like no other.</li>
            <li>So I finally finished my first bottle of DHC Deep Cleansing Oil after using it to remove my makeup daily for over a 1 year and a half!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>B002VAZINQ Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System - White]] and alternate with [[ASIN:B0009ET4QI Beauty Without Cruelty Facial Cleansing Milk, Extra Gentle 8.5fl oz]], which is another very gentile and natural facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few makeup removers in the past but nothing has ever worked to really take most of it off.</li>
            <li>The breakouts were pretty much all over face: my chin, a bit on my cheeks, along each side of my nose, all over my upper lip and a few on my forehead.</li>
            <li>The breakouts were pretty much all over face: my chin, a bit on my cheeks, along each side of my nose, all over my upper lip and a few on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Takes off my makeup like no other product.</li>
            <li>It certainly does not make my face tight or stripped of oil, it just feels normal after usage.  </li>
            <li>VERY SOOTHING FOR DRY SKIN!</li>
            <li>I have moderate acne (starting to improve with my new skincare cleansing routines!)</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and all soap regardless of how gentle, dries my face.</li>
            <li>little pricy but worth it</li>
            <li>Eye make-up remover almost always gets in your eyes a little or is absorbed through the lid.</li>
            <li>have been using DHC Deep Cleansing Oil for a while now, but back in March I decided to order it from this particular seller.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clean (no residue that needs to be wiped away with toner), soft and not at all dry or tight.</li>
            <li>Water based oil free cleansers that contain basic, and even no soap or detergents, DO NOT bond with the excess oil, they instead completely strip the skin of ALL oils and leave the skin tight and dry.</li>
            <li>generally lasts me 9-12 months.</li>
            <li>Every time I made up, it help me to remove the made up clearly and instantly.</li>
            <li>Gently rub over face and closed eyes.</li>
            <li>I have only ever been traumatized by what oil does to my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Two reasons:  it still irritates my unusually sensitive skin (especially around the eyes) and it is pricey.  </li>
            <li>44 year old fickle, mixed complexion skin and cleanser no longer likes my skin.  </li>
            <li>Back to the DHC oil- does not make me break out and it leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>It got through my mascara completely and left my skin feeling supple.</li>
            <li>B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]]</li>
            <li>and I really liked it, but it was solo expensive.</li>
            <li>Then add a little water, which will give it a very slight foaming action, and massage some more, then rinse.  </li>
            <li>I have my mom with normal skin on this cleanser, my aunt with sensitive skin, my grandmother with dry skin, and myself with combo/acne prone skin (formerly oil) on it.</li>
            <li>I have used this oil for several years to remove makeup, and occasionally to moisturize my face (I live in the desert).</li>
            <li>, I have very very acne prone skin and was attempting other things besides proactive but had to go back to proactive</li>
            <li>we are all dirty and although this is sold primary as a makeup remover oil cleansing is SUPER EFFECTIVE!!&lt;br /&gt;the oil cleansing idea</li>
            <li>I have a few large, dark acne scars around my chin that are still there and will take a few more months to completely heal and fade away.</li>
            <li>I have a few large, dark acne scars around my chin that are still there and will take a few more months to completely heal and fade away.</li>
            <li>, maybe they just did not use it in the right way since there is no directions on the bottle or in the box, I usually use 2 pumps and rub it on my whole face, I suggest that do not wet your face or hands before using this, you can wash your hands and dry them before you use this product.</li>
            <li>I apply this right to my [heavily made up] eyes at the end of the day, and my makeup washes away.</li>
            <li>I have tried other expensive Japanese face oils and the oddly greasy Eve Lom, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li>However, it can make your vision oddly blurry, which freaked me out at first.  </li>
            <li>But generally I use it with a gentle cleanser like recommended by other users.</li>
            <li>I usually follow it up with a mild cleanser</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricy, but you certainly get what you paid for!</li>
            <li>I follow with Cereve Foaming Facial Cleanser to thoroughly clean my skin, then apply my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I follow it up with my usual face wash to get extra clean skin.</li>
            <li>For make-up on other parts of your face, of course it works very well too.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves my otherwise dull gray looking skin so clean and glowing after using it.</li>
            <li>and I thought the bottle would be a little bigger considering the price, but it&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li>I am the type that will always go to bed with a clean face no matter what (late night partying, Vegas, etc.).  </li>
            <li>Took me at least five clean cotton pads to be done.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to use much; I use mine at least once a day</li>
            <li>but I was able to use it at least for 6 months til the bottle went empty, so I kept on buying it.</li>
            <li>it really works in removing makeup, not much for mascaras or waterproof eyeliners, there would still be some residue left even after cleaning it with this</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my face.</li>
            <li>this does not dry out your face</li>
            <li>It saves me time and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It feels a little weird to use at first, but my skin has never felt so soft, healthy, and</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that breaks out and fluctuates between oily and dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin and find that many cleansers left my skin dry and tight feeling, especially during the winter.  </li>
            <li>It balances my skin like no other facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this cleansing oil for anyone who has extremely dry facial skin!</li>
            <li>This was disappointing because I wanted to like this after hearing other peoples great reviews.</li>
            <li>generally follow this up with a second wash with [[ASIN:B000052ZB2</li>
            <li>Other gentle cleanser cannot remove all of my make-up, such as eye shadow and mascara.</li>
            <li>I have used other cleaning oils that have felt heavy, sticky, or even like the product was pulling on my skin as I  tried to smooth the oil over my face.  </li>
            <li>Follow this up with an other cleanser as this really meant to remove makeup and daily grime.</li>
            <li>first few times I used it, it did not go well.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used this oil, it caused me acne on my face.</li>
            <li>, I think the large bottle was less than $15 there.</li>
            <li>Massage it into dry skin (it really does need to be dry) and then rinse off with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>What I have found is that it works very well at breaking down and removing my make up at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>It left my face very soft but dry if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li>I always used cleansers that left my skin more on the dry side - but not a good thing when skin starts showing the signs of age.</li>
            <li>Not sure I got the right product.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The beauty of this cleanser is you can use it if you have oily, dry, sensitive, or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;moisturizes and made my old dry skin look</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive, dry skin like me, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>That said, if you use it correctly (directly onto dry skin, then rinse with water)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes all my makeup off and leave the skin soft, does not irritate or dry.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions completely, rubbing it onto dry skin and rinsing thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It was very comparable and slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li>yet I find that I don&#x27;t need nearly as much moisturizer as with previous cleansers.  </li>
            <li>I typically have oily skin and was concerned it would be too much...</li>
            <li>Recently I began using Estée Lauder double wear make up, and realized that, while it lasts all day long (a good thing), it was also very difficult to remove completely at night.</li>
            <li>Also, a little goes a very long way, which makes the price seem worth it.  </li>
            <li>When you put it in your hands it sort of runs down your palm and onto your wrist if you don&#x27;t use it fast enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously used more expensive cleansing oils such as Shu Umura and Bobby Brown and the DHC does exactly the same job at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Have always had skin that was in that category of not-terrible-but-never-great:  Not a broken out mess, but sort of oily, always one or two blemishes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Today I noticed I had some cleanser left on my old bottle and NOTICED SOMETHING  VERY STRANGE.....</li>
            <li>I occasionally will use a toner before applying the moisturizer but toners tend to dry the skin and defeats the purpose of using a oil soap to maintain the natural oils in your skin.</li>
            <li>than anything I&#x27;ve tried previously, you don&#x27;t use as much, so it really isn&#x27;t any more expensive.  </li>
            <li>it can not clean very good&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>I feel like it cleanses my face a little too much, and that is a</li>
            <li>I tested this new bottle of oil against the other bottle that I purchased from an authorized seller,SkinCareRx (by DHC, officially).  </li>
            <li>I use a separate eye makeup remover first to take off my eyeliner/mascara; then, while my face and hands are dry, I use about 1 and a half pumps of the oil and rub my entire face (avoiding the eye area) for about 20-30 seconds.</li>
            <li>It takes me literally less than 3 minutes to clean my face with heavy, water-proof make-up -</li>

            <li> excellent!</li>
            <li> It is the best choice to use this product for my face.</li>
            <li> soft!!&lt;br /&gt;Dissolves mascara (waterproof) with awesome smoothness, no need to worry about losing eyelashes on this cleanser</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser that anyone could ask for.  </li>
            <li> It is not drying, and cleanses perfectly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best because I want to remove my foundation on my face, perfectly!</li>

            <li> It takes off makeup perfectly, and I don&#x27;t have to do two steps to wash my face.  </li>
            <li> Awesome!</li>
            <li> With that being said, I felt the cleanser I was using for best 4 months wasn&#x27;t 100% removing the sunscreen or junk that was building up on my face.</li>
            <li> DHC is probably your best BET!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, for the price is a good cleanser, but I would stick with SHU UEMURA if I could afford it!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I like it!</li>
            <li> All good!</li>
            <li> I feel is a good part of the reason for keeping it at its best.</li>

            <li> It is a great product.</li>
            <li> it feels so great.  </li>
            <li> It smells like olive oil and fills like oil but washes away great.</li>
            <li> Cleans great.</li>
            <li> You wouldnt think an oil based product would work on acne prone skin but it works great with zero break outs.</li>
            <li> So proud I could get it on time, was out of it.</li>
            <li> which feels great and also great for my complexion and face muscles</li>
            <li> Great service also.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be a great makeup remover</li>

            <li> Great if you have issues with rosacea.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s GREAT as an eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy to find it on amazon with prime shipping.</li>
            <li> Great.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil is great.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job removing makeup and moistening your skin.  </li>
            <li> Great for after peels.</li>

            <li> Great for removing eye makeup,  mascara and all.</li>
            <li> and she feels it is a great value.  </li>
            <li> This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> but it works great and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> and I think the size of the bottle is a great value.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing oil, which I&#x27;ve never used before.</li>
            <li> Having seeing great reviews for this though, I went ahead and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> It dissolves great with water.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years great for taking off makeup even eye makeup..</li>
            <li> but this leaves my skin in great shape and seems to help control oil production.</li>
            <li> this makes my skin feel great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for over a month, and my skin looks great.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for years with great results but this product is greasy and smells like rugular cooking olive oil.</li>
            <li> Great job on cleaning makeup.  </li>
            <li> bottle lasts me 9 months using it once a day in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for a great product.</li>

            <li> Honestly the cleansing oil works wonders!</li>
            <li> I really love this DHC product, it is the best cleansing i have used.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleansing oil and the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed to see the product is authentic</li>
            <li> I have used many cleansing oils and I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this great cleansing oil for years now and my skin couldn&#x27;t look better!</li>
            <li> Makeup comes off and rinses very easily!</li>
            <li> I follow cleansing with the DHC Coenzyme Q10 face cream and the DHC Eye Bright moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really a great product and an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> It is soo good</li>
            <li> This was actually a really good product, just not by this seller (Olive Care).</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> the bottle I bought from this seller was nowhere as good as the one I bought before.</li>
            <li> Feel good after cleaning</li>
            <li> I received a sample in the mail some time ago and loved using the product.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good price.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried a cheaper alternative, and it just was not as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> So I searched around on Amazon and this looked good</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so good.  </li>
            <li> I would say as good as Earnest Lazlo</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> I was using the Shu Uemura Anti/Oxi Skin refining cleanser and loved it (still do) but will be switching to DHC now.</li>
            <li> I have loved this for years.  </li>
            <li> Really good.</li>
            <li> so the lack of scrubbing is also good for my face.  </li>
            <li> I use an additional product from my dermatologist afterwards, so I can&#x27;t say this gets everything off 100%, but it does a dang good job.</li>
            <li> All trace of makeup is gone, and my skin has never been this good.</li>
            <li> Paired with a really good moisturizer, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> good product, will recommend it to friends and</li>
            <li> This product is good for taking taking out the make up in just one step, though is not as good to take my mascara (not waterproof) out as it was the SHU UEMURA oil.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Price is also fair.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product through DHC and it is as good as everyone says.</li>
            <li> has replaced the costly she uemura oil for good.  </li>
            <li> I use this with My BHA and AHA and my skin has never looked so good.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it felt on my face, and I could feel the debris it was pulling out of my pores.</li>
            <li> , it is quite good replacement from Shu Uemura.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it was soooo good, so I decided to re-purchase, when the product arrived</li>
            <li> After having my fair share with cleansing oils</li>
            <li> but does just as good a job at removing my make up and cleaning my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have found to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li> very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Great DHC product, in fact this Oil is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff; great at removing make-up and moisturizing and softening.</li>
            <li> Cleans your face great love this oil will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for all skin types, even oily/combination skin like mine, and I can see myself using it for many years.  </li>
            <li> very satisfied with purchase and seller</li>
            <li> You will be very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The oil is great for oil cleansing and what I absolutely love about this product is..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just magical and great and I will probably use this to remove my makeup for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy I bought this :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased that I did.</li>
            <li> I really love this cleanser, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It works the best and the price is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Turns out it becomes a nice pampering ritual, and I bet increasing blood flow to your face is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample in the mail and tried it and loved it!</li>
            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Exposed the oil on my skin more so (my skin is already oily too!)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t  get any better than this!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is my first cleansing oil, very happy I had give it try, will order it again.</li>
            <li> I was at first taken aback by the oil consistency, but it works great!</li>
            <li> They work OK too, but for me, this original formula works best.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>

            <li> The best ever and very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I also researched others now that oil is catching on in the States</li>
            <li> So I always stayed away from cosmetic products which contain any kind of oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Care kindly sent me a complementary bottle of DHC cleansing oil, but this one also is defective.  </li>
            <li> So it is a bit tricky to use but effectively cleanses skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your face parched.</li>
            <li> Nice cleaning oil that cuts through all the makeup grease and oil.</li>
            <li> This is really one of the best cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, nice product.</li>
            <li> Washes off nicely with water.</li>
            <li> Then follow with your own cleanser and skin regimen afterwards.</li>
            <li> Nice to discover that I can purchase it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> i will use it all on its own if im lazy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best cleansing oil ever.</li>
            <li> This really is the best.</li>
            <li> and it just rinses away with warm water.  </li>
            <li> Apply warm water and work up an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly... I dont use it to remove makeup</li>
            <li> the massage for about 1 minute... rinse with warm water...</li>
            <li> I then jump in the shower and the oil emulsifies when I rinse my face with warm water.  </li>
            <li> Used samples received in the mail and liked this product immediately.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample in the mail and loved it so went online to find more.</li>
            <li> Then, I rinse with warm water.  </li>
            <li> on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> This is my highest holy grail product out of every skincare, makeup, cosmetic, shoe, purse, etc I own.</li>
            <li> One of the best oil cleansers for the price, and the packaging works very well to dispense the correct amount of product.</li>
            <li> Then rinse away with warm water.</li>
            <li> and it feels so nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> Then I use a washcloth with warm water to rinse.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin nice and moist.</li>
            <li> One pump of this and some warm water after massaging it in, and nothing is on.</li>
            <li> , yes I&#x27;d you use it on your eyes if for whatever reason you do own your eyes with it still on your eyes</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I honestly don&#x27;t smell anything.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice cleanser.  </li>
            <li> but after I use it, my husband always tells me that my skin looks nice.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li> This has been popular for a reason.</li>
            <li> Then rinse with warm water.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for gentle, yet thorough makeup removal.</li>

            <li> It made my skin feel so soft and look awesome!</li>

            <li> Great first step to any cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li> Great product that does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Boscia Makeup-Breakup Cool Cleansing Oil for about a year  and loved it until I found this.</li>
            <li> Pleasant light fragrance, easy to use, not at all oily or greasy, removes all makeup with one step.</li>
            <li> :) Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> It takes off makeup easily, and unlike a lot of makeup removers, this doesn&#x27;t have any kind of chemical scent</li>
            <li> and it is excellent, does not dry or irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then I follow with a mild face wash and a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Very good stuff ... removes all the make up effectively and does not dry my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to keep my face oil free for most of my life!  </li>
            <li> Many people believe that is you have oily skin</li>
            <li> and I love the result.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Why I love this:&lt;br /&gt;-Amazing</li>
            <li> I am glad to know Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best for removing makeup without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> I flush appropriately.  </li>
            <li> I still love my coconut oil and continue to use depending on my make-up routine.  </li>
            <li> I know many people believe because it&#x27;s oil</li>
            <li> The touch of water after using it on face is magical.</li>
            <li> and I love the cleansing and moisturizing power of the oil.</li>
            <li> For waterproof mascara though, you&#x27;ll have to scrub a lot more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This time however, the product was a lot more oily</li>
            <li> and i had to stand under the shower while furiously rubbing my face just to get most of it off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure if this is the maker or the seller&#x27;s fault</li>
            <li> but this oil cleanser does not work any more.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> My most favourite cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> We tried so many products before.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I think you are paying more for the brand than quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it takes off makeup and cleanses in on step without drying</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> If you suffer from allergies to perfumes, dyes or have sensitive skin, this is an ideal product.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> Is it better than avocado oil?</li>
            <li> I was once in love with this cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> My face has become better since I stopped using this</li>
            <li> To those on the fence I say try it, it works great and really wish my skin had reacted better.</li>
            <li> Love DHC.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin silky smooth!</li>

            <li> My favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I need to use soap for sure to remove the oiliness.</li>
            <li> ;  If this lot is defective, I guess it&#x27;s DHC&#x27;s fault, but since Olive Care is not officially authorized by DHC to sell their products, DHC would not be able to do anything about our purchases through Olive Care.</li>
            <li> I purchased this using a coupon that I bought from one of those daily email sites and have been very impressed.</li>
            <li> yet I also don&#x27;t feel like my skin/pores appear any better off since I started this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>

            <li> this product is just ok,</li>
            <li> I had tons of clogged pores mostly blackheads that I have trying to get rid of for 8 months using salicylic acid and retina.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feel so much better after incorporating the DHC cleansing oil..</li>

            <li> But as I use it more and more, I notice my skin condition is better and better.</li>

            <li> Smells overwhelmingly like olive oil.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> The Deep Cleansing Oil is awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful cleanser and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best makeup remover out there.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than three months with no issues.  </li>
            <li> Actually, my skin looks great!  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with all of my DHC products and will continue to purchase them-the cleansing oil is light and effective.</li>
            <li> I make sure that I rub lots of it over and below my eye-lashes and along my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used most of the line.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and always wait until DHC puts it on sale to purchase a years supply.</li>
            <li> Overall wonderful product though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year and love the results I get from it.  </li>
            <li> Then make sure to rinse with water thoroughly to get it all off.</li>
            <li> Great product, really gets stubborn makeup off</li>
            <li> I have been using DHC cleansing oil for more than 4 years.</li>
            <li> I bought DHC oil from physical store before, and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I have used this product for well over a year now, and I really love it.</li>
            <li> Removes most of my makeup and/or sunscreen with one to two pumps of product.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels after cleaning with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I just have to rub a bit more</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have to use more then</li>
            <li> Love it, recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works much better than a soap based cleanser.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use any more than that</li>
            <li> and I love the feeling it gives my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended it over and over for years and have converted many to the idea of putting oil on their face.  </li>
            <li> and I love it in the winter.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be better hydrating than this one.  </li>
            <li> It does not have mineral oil either, which I love.  </li>
            <li> I will order more from this shop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it again someday.n top of cleaning them every week, but this didn&#x27;t make the cystic acne stop.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love washing my face with this product.  </li>
            <li> I already repurchase 2 bottles more, is one of my favorite products of my skin care routine :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed I do not have as many breakouts as I used to before trying this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this oil cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> AND NOTHING HAS BEEN ABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing like Asian skincare - but DHC is truly the best.</li>
            <li> It works quite well :-)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> , rinses off perfectly; best eye makeup remover; I follow up with facial soap.  </li>
            <li> Blocked my pore more than unblocked them.  </li>
            <li> It removes make up like magic.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else I&#x27;m pretty well amazed and pretty well impressed by this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this; I&#x27;m a believer now, too.</li>
            <li> Just wonderful, light, soft</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless cleansers over the years &amp; this one is the best!</li>
            <li> No cleanser removes makeup better than an oil based cleanser for those who&#x27;ve never tried.</li>
            <li> My skin is better now and this is all I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this followed by a toner every night for about two weeks now and my skin is looking better than it has in quite some time.</li>
            <li> Frankly, nothing removes makeup better.  </li>
            <li> Give these a try, they really work great</li>
            <li> This has been  my favorite cleanser for a decade now.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!  </li>
            <li> And I love it for my dryness and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever tried  :-)  </li>
            <li> I want to love this</li>
            <li> It feels and sort of smells like mostly olive oil, but olive oil doesn&#x27;t emulsify like this does.  </li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser, melts away all makeup.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> Many people have reservations about using an oil</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I used some cleansing before,but this one is my favorite...</li>
            <li> After I did more research I found that many (MANY)</li>
            <li> I suppose I fall into that category of many.</li>
            <li> I AM ENJOYING THIS PRODUCT, WORKS</li>
            <li> I have done a homemade olive oil and caster oil face cleanser for sometime but was never in love with it.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews of this stuff are very positive, for good reason.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you guys have all heard amazing things about this cleansing oil, and all if them are true.</li>
            <li> This is nice because it washes out clean with water too; I don&#x27;t ever need to use toner to wipe away residual grime.</li>
            <li> Is famous for taking off make-up so well, and I find it more effective than super high-end products like Laura Mercier and Shiseido.  </li>
            <li> It also has a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li> generally doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin very good.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling very clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling very clean, without any oily residue at all.</li>
            <li> My skin gets very clean and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, the color is darker than it should be, it feels &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;, and it doesn&#x27;t wash off very cleanly.</li>
            <li> and I am in love with this product already.er compensates for the dryness by becoming overly oily and causes-</li>
            <li> It is pretty good at removing makeup though.</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first used it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> The best product bar none for a soft super clean face!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how perfect until I tried another product that was highly rated.  </li>
            <li> This oil is so surprisingly unique!</li>
            <li> I am new to DHC line, but every product w DHC WAS TRULY GREAT.</li>
            <li> Its strong but not abrasive; I also love that it feels like I&#x27;m massaging my face</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it ever has (adult acne greatly reduced).</li>

            <li> FEELS CLEAN AFTER APPLYING AND REMOVING!</li>
            <li> It washes off completely clean!</li>
            <li> I also use it to clean my brushes!</li>
            <li> Sure enough, it is as good as I remember!</li>
            <li> I mainly use this because it removes eye makeup so effectively, so that is kind of a bummer.  </li>
            <li> Overall a very good product.  </li>
            <li> It is very good at removing mascara and washing my face at the same time.</li>
            <li> and this is the best reasonably priced, high quality cleanser I have found.  </li>
            <li> I was so glad to see this product available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for removing makeup while leaving the skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> DHC has a monthly free catalog that has free samples in it!</li>
            <li> but it is not as that fantastic as many reviewers have claimed here.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural and this is great for ANY type of skin.</li>
            <li> I know removing makeup is so much more important than putting on makeup..</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different by miles and for some it may not be the ideal product, but maybe it WILL work for you-</li>
            <li> Skin then over compensates for the dryness by becoming overly oily and causes-</li>
            <li> Great product that leaves skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> my face feels clean and smooth and this very easily removes all makeup- without having to scrub eye makeup off.</li>
            <li> It washes off very easily with water, leaving the skin feeling so smooth and clean.</li>

            <li> Natural and better for you!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 12 years, I have tried so many cleansers, always choosing the most natural, and this is # by far the very best</li>
            <li> It takes off eye makeup, even waterproof, so quickly and easily!</li>

            <li> It removes mascara easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I use one pump (and that is generous), which rinses easily leaving no residue.</li>
            <li> and it comes off easily when you wash it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not that easy to remove.</li>
            <li> But if you want truly clean, de-gunked skin, this with a cleanser does a better job than anything else I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love how clean and moisturized it leaves my skin</li>

            <li> The oil washes off easily and your skin is not oily afterwards.</li>
            <li> Also it washes off easily while taking off some of the dirt and residue on your face.</li>

            <li> Easily removes all traces of dirt, grime, and makeup from my face.</li>

            <li> really good, I am using it on a day-to-day basis now.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to use your own facial cleanser after this.</li>
            <li> also let your skin smooth and so clean!</li>
            <li> Ok, ladies (in particular) - if you want perfectly beautiful skin that makes you look like a million bucks and years younger, with skin so incredibly silky soft and smooth - better than a baby&#x27;s butt, then this is what you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but this is good for all-over the face cleanser, easy to use, no hard rubbing to do when removing makeup</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s redness and general irritation as well as texture of my flesh has also greatly improved.  </li>
            <li> This face wash is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Just ordered a full bottle. :)</li>
            <li> I needed something that would take it off, but even more for when I wear a full face of makeup when I go out.  </li>
            <li> It is hands down the best cleanser that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is the best makeup remover cleanser hands down</li>
            <li> Seemed to do a fine job of cleaning, so kept using it.  </li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> Takes off the foundation and the eyeshadow just fine.  </li>
            <li> It easily removes my make up and leaves my skin smooth not oily.</li>

            <li> I love the routine because it goes so quickly and effortlessly</li>
            <li> a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Luckily I know this product well, so I know the drill, but if you need directions or assurance this product meets  FDA standards you may want to contact the seller before you purchase!</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the DHC mild soap to go along with this.</li>
            <li> and I love how quickly it works.</li>
            <li> I wear light eye makeup so it works fine.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;method&amp;#34; takes a little bit of getting used to, but the outcome is the best.  </li>
            <li> It is the most gentle way to get ALL makeup off in a snap!!</li>
            <li> I used to think the little make up remover cloths were the best until I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Eye makeup remover + DHC deep cleansing oil + face wash &#x3D; beautiful clean face.  </li>
            <li> The product is wonderful removes 100% of my makeup, goes on my face smooth comes off with little effort.</li>
            <li> that is a HUGE boon.  </li>
            <li> Acutane changed my life and took away the really huge acne.</li>
            <li> Cleans make up off easy and leaves face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> But since the shipping was free here,i had to have it.</li>
            <li> And while I was applying toner I notice that there was still some residue make up on my face because my cotton swab was a light beige color from the foundation that the cleanser didn&#x27;t take out.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the type of make up (i.e. water proof), it does an amazing job of removing makeup efficiently and gently.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this after all the amazing reviews but was leery with the use of oil how it would make my skin react.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin silky smooth, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great facial wash.</li>
            <li> Removes ALL makeup easily and leaves skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> And the seller of this item on Amazon is fantastic.</li>
            <li> DHC is a great Japanese skin care brand anything you buy from them is quality.</li>
            <li> breakout free in my life.</li>
            <li> will say, I got my husband to try it out since he saw me loving it so much.</li>
            <li> Switching to gentler products helped resolve the acne, but I was still oily and just never looked bright and clear.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different products to remove make up but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> so this sounded totally bizarre to me.</li>
            <li> In the morning a light non-soap cleanser or just water is all I need.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face so smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> my face feels nice after the whole cleansing porcess...  </li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of use, my face was radiant and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but DHC is specifically a MAKEUP REMOVER which is so important.</li>
            <li> but it does a fabulous job!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for deep cleaning and softening - esp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic for removing sunscreen, which I wear every day, and makeup, which I seldom wear.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth after I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> I had great doubts about using oil as a cleaning agent, especially since I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> they all liked it so much they all bought bottles</li>
            <li> , I definitely like the feel of cleansing with oil, and this is a great starter price.</li>
            <li> DHC directs you to follow with a gentle soap and toner, but the cleansing oil is so effective that sometimes I finish with cotton pads and a witch hazel toner.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend anyone to try it out if they are looking for a great makeup remover.</li>
            <li> But if you are into pricey, then I would even take it further and get Lancome&#x27;s cleansing oil which is also great.</li>
            <li> This products gets my face squeakily clean easily, and is nondrying.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT TIPS TO FOLLOW -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Massage the oil into your skin, this includes eye makeup too, then rinse gently with washcloth and warm water.</li>
            <li> It rinses off with ease and leaves your face silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Removes make up, grime and leaves skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> and he is so happy with the improvement in his acne and overall complexion.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT FOR A FACIAL MASSAGE.</li>
            <li> You do have to make sure you rub it good around the eyes to remove makeup, especially stubborn eyeliner, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> Its quality is good for sensitive skin with a resonable price.</li>
            <li> Its a great, gentle cleanser that really takes off the toughest sunscreen and makeup.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin, but still I want to keep it clean!</li>
            <li> have acne prone fair skin, not easily burned in summer since I am olive toned albeit fair.</li>
            <li> Surely, it can&#x27;t be the oil clogging my pores and causing the breakouts because it&#x27;s all rinsed away cleanly, right?</li>
            <li> The oil wipes off beautifully and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel at all dry.</li>
            <li> It has a very light fragrance of lavender and smells very much like the products used at the spa.</li>
            <li> This is non-foaming but your skin feels very fresh.</li>
            <li> You will love this product, leaves your skin clean fresh and no oily finish.</li>
            <li> Love this product and you get a large bottle!</li>
            <li> This gets you clean while leaving you smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This product does not do any of those; it goes on smoothly and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a face wash that leaves your face so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> My face always comes away feeling clean and smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is getting so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> although perhaps it soaks into my skin more effectively than is generally the case.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using it with my exfoliating brush to really clean out my pores and skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My complexion feels so clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Takes my makeup off quickly and rinses off easily.  </li>
            <li> A cheaper and just as effective alternative is to use olive oil which is the main ingredient in this product.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and cleanses better than soap.</li>
            <li> but I love love love DHC Deep Cleansing Oil.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It cleans quite effectively, i used it as a make up remover, followed with a normal face wash afterward.</li>
            <li> It felt wonderful on my skin and left it feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Had heard about this product so was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> Worth its weight in gold &amp;#60;and price&amp;#62;!</li>

            <li> I needed to convince my daughters that this is the best makeup remover by buying them the small bottles -</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It is worth a try, and if you wear face makeup, it is a must!</li>
            <li> I originally got a sample of this and was hesitant to try it</li>
            <li> I love layered skin care regimens, so this is my first step at the end of my day.</li>
            <li> Then you wash it off with warm water, followed by a normal cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> Alternatives I recommend to remove makeup with are: the Original Neutrogena Make-up Remover Cleansing Towelettes or the Proactiv Makeup Removing Towelettes, which I use to remove face makeup/suncreen (regardless of if it&#x27;s waterproof or not, and for waterproof mascara/eye makeup Lancome Bi-Facil or Clinique Take The Day Off.</li>
            <li> my original cleanser that I HAVE BEEN USING FOR YEARS</li>
            <li> Worth the cost!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty healthy eater and I&#x27;m all about the health benefits of olive oil, so rubbing this cleanser into my face feels so clean and</li>

            <li> Once I discovered this product, I can&#x27;t use anything else to clean my face.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it says that the product rinses clean with water but does not.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also good as an occasional head oil, when you have product or oil build up.</li>
            <li> This seems to do a good job of deep cleaning-hence the name.</li>
            <li> Although it is listed as &amp;#34;deep cleansing&amp;#34; you do need to use a good facial soap after (though no scrubbing is needed).</li>
            <li> am a person who takes good care of my skin with daily routines.</li>
            <li> I remembered the DHC deep cleansing oil from years ago, and was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years and it really takes off any types of makeup.</li>
            <li> Guessing I&#x27;m 6-8 weeks into regular use and about halfway through a bottle, so I&#x27;d consider it a good value given the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Use a good moisturizer to help with potential drying.</li>
            <li> I really thought I was going to love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Now, I use makeup remover sheets, so much easier and better for my face.  </li>
            <li> Now the full size is part of their Christmas cache.</li>
            <li> Not straying from the tried and true again.  </li>
            <li> I find this cleansing oil very drying, and it might even be better for an oilier complexion than mine.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> After reading such good reviews, I decided to splurge and try this product</li>
            <li> All you can really do is try it for yourself :)</li>
            <li> I cleaned all my brushes very thoroughly and kept on top of cleaning them every week, but this didn&#x27;t make the cystic acne stop.</li>
            <li> but I think this product cleanses a bit more thoroughly while still remaining gentle.</li>
            <li> Price of the DHC product is quite good, especially compared to Korean/Japanese products.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the best way to use this for my skin is first to pump one long pump into my palms, rub my hands together to spread the oil and warm it up, and then apply to my dry face.  </li>
            <li> Had I opted to spend twice as much on DHC products (easy to do)shipping would have been free.</li>
            <li> I now know that the more gentile you treat your skin with good quality products, like this oil, the less oil your skin will produce trying to hydrate itself.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product really gives a deep clean as well as great moisturization.</li>
            <li> Plus, the color is more green than light green/yellow, which makes me think even more that it may have been tampered/compromised ....not satisfied at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like this stuff cleanses your face pretty well because my face feels smooth and squeaky clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin very clean without drying much.</li>
            <li> In addition to having fair, sensitive skin, I have wrinkles and large pores.  </li>
            <li> Face feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years along with Mild Soap for makeup removal.</li>
            <li> I really love this, and am glad I gave it a second chance!</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with their Mild soap.</li>
            <li> For the 1st time in my life, I was suffering from a mild eczema.  </li>
            <li> Have priced it out for the travel sizes, and looks like the big bottle is the best value, and the travel size they sell doesn&#x27;t have a pump, so I&#x27;m buying some dropping bottles to fill from the big bottle for my travel and gym bag.  </li>
            <li> It also removes all make-up quickly and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and find it to be the best thing to use to loosen the sunscreen on my face prior to washing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between this oil versus regular olive oil, but this deep cleansing oil is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I tend to tear up when I laugh, so I absolutely have to wear waterproof eye makeup which can be challenging to get off.  </li>
            <li> This stuff makes me feel like I am winning against my skin problems as well as making sure my skin is moisturized enough</li>
            <li> Well, I get about three days where this stuff is great, but then it seems like after that my skin gets real oily and gross.</li>
            <li> DHC also has a huge drive for natural and safe products that are not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> it can remove the make-up quickly and completely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Best!&lt;br /&gt;Cleans &amp; leaves your skin feeling super</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take any acne medications orally as I am trying to get pregnant and treat my body like its pregnant in preparation.</li>
            <li> With older skin, dryness now is more of an issue than it used to be</li>
            <li> and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> company is super generous with sample.</li>
            <li> And, it is super oily.</li>
            <li> Either #1 - they have super, super oily acne-prone skin and/or</li>
            <li> Odorless, mild, yet melts away make-up including waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Being a huge proponent for organic and natural living, I love the idea of not cleaning my skin with bubbles, namely sodium laurel sulfates and petroleum derived petrochemicals, fragrances, and parabens.</li>
            <li> but I love using this at the end of the day; it just makes my pores feel cleaned, and my face gets soft and smooth every time.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this because I use the Proactiv system (which I love</li>
            <li> Received product quickly.</li>
            <li> Like the pump, just two quick squirts is all you need.</li>
            <li> DHC is amazing with free samples as well, you get free samples every single month in their catalog.</li>
            <li> Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works like a dream, foams up a little with the application of water, rinses away clean, and leaves my skin so soft and clean that it feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I follow up with an acne wash just in case, and I tend to save this stuff for only when I&#x27;m removing makeup since it&#x27;s a pricey, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> but this is fantastic for a first go makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I have tried other cleansing oils but never found one I liked better.  </li>
            <li> but the shipping was free and lightning fast!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Wife bought this and LOVED it, we live use to live in Cali and when we moved to AZ she could not find anything for the dryness here.  </li>
            <li> Just apply a small quantity onto dry face, massage around (especially good for eye makeup removal) then rinse off in shower or with a washcloth and warm water.</li>
            <li> Even though I love dhc oil I still like to rotate products on occasion to test new things</li>
            <li> No more dry skin, or oily skin for that matter: just clean, pleasant, supple, completely happy skin.</li>
            <li> Its fast, its easy and my skin likes it.</li>
            <li> it will not dry you out &amp; you wont get any kind of reaction.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant about using it because of the whole oil aspect of it, but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> cleansing oil is thicker than the shu uemura but clears out easily with water and leaves the skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this oil; it makes my skin very soft after rinsing.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser for my very sensitive and outbreak-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job of breaking down and removing makeup and dirt without stripping your skins natural oils.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Keeps skin from drying out yet cleans deep pores more than you&#x27;d think!</li>
            <li> but it really does get all the make-up off!!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the Mia brush with the sensitive brush head!</li>
            <li> Next time I will more than one thing !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been use DHC deep cleansing oil for over 4 years now, I love it!</li>
            <li> I need to wash the oil off my face more than 3 times with the facial foam, but the ones I have been using is not that oily and is easily washed off from my face.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Some others seem to have experienced the same thing as me, and I am pretty sure they got the same lot, which I think is &amp;#34;FFMTS(on</li>
            <li> Even caked on mascara comes off quickly and easily, leaving your face soft and clean.</li>
            <li> By doing all this you will minimize pores and fine lines and also make your skin feel very pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works pretty well and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> how good it cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out or leave it oily!</li>
            <li> Just pure unadulterated olive oil.  </li>
            <li> I also really enjoy the pure olive smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as well as other popular cleansing oils I&#x27;ve tried (MAC, Origins, Josie Maran), but I think my favorite thing is the pump (though you really only need a 1/2 pump at most), the fact that it has no smell, and it washes clean off.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as great but a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Other have noted the scent, the hint of rosemary is pleasant.</li>
            <li> My face has never been so clean and clear, and so easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, have used for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> This deep cleansing oil is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> The bottle pump is also GREAT, it keeps things from getting messy.</li>
            <li> I use a real gentle cleanser after to wash the oil off.  </li>
            <li> I follow it up with a DHC cleanser and their amazing nighttime extra moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Deep Cleansing Oil for years and was so glad to see it available on Amazon now.  </li>
            <li> This is because I think this cleanser is worth my time, and impressive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Wish it was more natural like the LAVO brand</li>
            <li> DHC has most natural ingredients of all.</li>
            <li> It may be pricey but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> the price - I&#x27;ve never bought nice facial stuff in my life, so I was quite weary about whether it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this feeling, but I think it&#x27;s important to consider if this visual disturbs you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Removes stubborn eye makeup easily, leaves skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Esp like to rub it in and let it sit a minute while I get ready to get in the shower; don&#x27;t know if it does really anything more, just kinda feels like a mini ritual/treatment.  </li>
            <li> and I should have lovely clear skin again.</li>
            <li> Maybe because my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten more sensitive.</li>
            <li> You simply pump this into your hand and then rub it on your face and then wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels clean but not dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s worth a try for just about everyone.  </li>
            <li> I have also had blackheads in my nose since elementary school.</li>
            <li> Soft, dewy, lovely.</li>
            <li> wanted to share this because my mom, she rarely praises about things I purchase on Amazon x)</li>
            <li> Safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Takes off makeup and leaves skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> The best part is that even though this is an oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind.  </li>
            <li> Not much odor, good consistency.</li>
            <li> I love it because it takes make up completely</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth</li>
            <li> I love this product, it takes off my makeup without stripping it and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so incredible, and I&#x27;m definitely going to start buying this product regularly.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, though.</li>
            <li> I love the soft feel of my skin afterwards, I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> ITS A NICE YELLOW TONE TO IT AND THINER THAN THE ONE FROM THIS SELLER.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Gets off all dirt and makeup easily and leaves skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> No artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels freshly scrubbed -</li>
            <li> I love using this cleanser with my favorite cleaning brush it really digs deep into the skin</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it away, going to get a facial as a reset for my face and made my own blend of castor and sesame oils.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle but removes makeup quickly.</li>
            <li> First, just using straight olive oil made the olive oil smell too strong.</li>
            <li> Dissolves any makeup, washes off clean, makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> They are very customer friendly.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, product arrived in original packaging.</li>
            <li> DHC is a pretty fantastic brand and has some pretty stellar products.</li>
            <li> Cleans extremely well and is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> After using DHC cleanser together with other moisture product, my skin is in good condition.</li>
            <li> If you are someone who wears a good amount of face makeup on a regular basis, I highly recommend you to find a makeup remover that will efficiently take it all off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product right here on Amazon, after reading the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> It is not oily and comes right off.  </li>
            <li> Right now its on sale until 3/31/11 at DHC for $21.00 for a 6.7 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of how it FELT right away.  </li>
            <li> even waterproof eye make up comes right off with this.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Just splash water on my face and the oil and make up rinse right off.</li>
            <li> Somehow, on my combo skin, it feels just right.</li>
            <li> Apply it right out of the bottle and massage it into your face.  </li>
            <li> Slathering oil onto my face just felt right, like this is how washing your face is supposed to feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give up on the oil right away</li>
            <li> Non greasy, rinse right off.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I only splash luke warm water on my face and let it dry on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> This is a great make up remove and even though you may feel apprehensive at first about using oil to cleanse, I can guarantee that it makes your face feel just as clean as soap--which will actually strip your skin of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser hands down..</li>
            <li> The thought of putting a nice oil on my dry sensitive skin to clean it sounded wonderful, but there&#x27;s no lovely smell, just smells like olive oil, and it doesn&#x27;t take off my eye makeup very well at all.  </li>
            <li> Slippery to massage, rinses clean, understated smell, leaves my oily skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle for my face but clean very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like it this much, but all the reviews are true.</li>
            <li> So happy to find I could purchase through Amazon and save a few dollars on it!</li>
            <li> Not sure about waterproof mascara but great for foundation, lipstick, sunscreen, et al.</li>
            <li> On most days, I don&#x27;t even have to use a separate eye makeup remover because it is both strong and gentle enough to get normal work eye-makeup off cleanly.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for myself but did not have it long as my son decided he liked the cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clean and soft--especially good as we head into the harsh winter months!  </li>
            <li> good for clean makeup, heavy sun block!</li>
            <li> I love how it feels; it gets off your makeup quickly; it rinses easily; and it does not leave your face feeling tight.  </li>
            <li> Great item, very smooth, good for use it in cold, dry winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is certainly a 10!  </li>
            <li> feels amazing on the skin and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li> I have been using the deep cleansing oil for a few months now and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This never leaves a residue and removes completely and easily.</li>
            <li> Rub your hands together to warm the oil and apply to your dry face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The great thing about DHC is it doesn&#x27;t hurt you if you use it daily or several times a day.</li>
            <li> Goes on greasy, rinses off easily and completely.  </li>
            <li> You apply it to a dry face and rinse all of it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for years and can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed by how it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your face, it simply washes off with plain water...</li>
            <li> So gentle but entirely effective, removes every last trace of make-up and leaves skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> , however, I normally just use olive oil to clean my face..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thorough, removes all traces of makeup, rinses cleanly, &amp; leaves skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft, clean, and calm.</li>
            <li> And just noticing when I was using the restroom and caught myself in the mirror, nothing particularly dramatic, but that my skin just looked healthy and bright.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> On a scale o 1 - 10 mine would likely be a 7.5 - this DHC cleansing oil cleans the dirt and makeup off easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think I would like or use this product very much, but a friend insisted that I try a cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li> I am 26 now and I still get acne, not nearly as bad as in high school, but I&#x27;m always looking for the cure to take away my acne.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for stubborn hard to remove waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Face is soft, but not yet convinced this is better than a high quality EVOO.</li>
            <li> my face doesnt feel tight and dry after washing it, and it is the best makeup remover ever!!</li>
            <li> You can notice the difference the first time &amp; others will compliment you on your complexion.</li>
            <li> I lOve DHC Deep cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> This really takes off all my makeup!</li>
            <li> When you first put it on your face it feels like oil (no smell)</li>
            <li> It was the first one I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just turned 40 and after one week my face is looking younger, brighter and more radiant.    </li>
            <li> it is my favorite deep cleaning oil.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Wash off with warm wet cloth.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for several years but had to order it from the manufacturer which took more time to come in.</li>
            <li> I use it to remove my makeup every day and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The magic of this stuff is only a dime size of oil does the trick.</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying oil cleaning</li>
            <li> It makes my night routine so much easier!  </li>
            <li> I love DHC&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Oil.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product through a friend, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I still had my larger bottle to refill.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and travel with seem to deep clean and goes on smoothly really try to use it every night</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more convenient than pouring into a smaller bottle for travel.</li>
            <li> It works gently including washing off mascara!</li>
            <li> I had this as a sample at first and then got full-size bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin - I never would have thought a cleansing OIL would be exactly what I&#x27;ve needed all these years.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve got the oil in my eyes before and nothing happened because it&#x27;s so light and natural)</li>
            <li> Always make sure I don&#x27;t run out and have a back up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last 2 years, love it, it works.</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue!</li>
            <li> On a night out where I use a lot more makeup I apply and rinse a second time.</li>
            <li> pretty well I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Leaving my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I started getting compliments on my skin for the first time in, like...</li>
            <li> Then I wash with my favorite facial wash and the sunscreen is thoroughly removed.</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I also love the smaller three pack for traveling.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in over 25 years that his has happened.</li>
            <li> Well that was my first reaction.</li>
            <li> EWG rates the ingredients as safe (I looked them up individually since the product isn&#x27;t rated yet).</li>
            <li> My favorite beauty product and the only one that hasn&#x27;t changed...</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she totally fell in love with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will most definitely order again.</li>
            <li> The cleansing oil is one of the first I ordered</li>
            <li> at first.  </li>
            <li> I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> This oil works really well at cleansing my face of all make up without drying it out!</li>
            <li> If you read the back of the bottle of most cleansers they say they remove oil, &amp; dirt, they are not designed to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered this product from anywhere but the official DHC website.</li>
            <li> I use it when I have makeup on and also when I don&#x27;t; really god smell too!</li>
            <li> Also, there is no weird smell.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of DHC or it&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Oil, and as most acne sufferers I was petrified to try it as putting oil on combination acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> After only a week, my skin felt smoother and I think it looks better.  </li>
            <li> It becomes the first thing I&#x27;d love to do when I go back home.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews touting the glory of this stuff, so I went out and bought two bottles thinking I had found the magic for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love it since I started using it last year.</li>
            <li> My favorite product for several years.</li>
            <li> I have received free samples of this product in the past and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid DHC user.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this was the first time I did not have a break out.</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle!</li>
            <li> Love this over regular soaps!  </li>
            <li> I love DHC Deep Cleansing Oil.  </li>
            <li> Love it - only oil cleanser</li>
            <li> First cleanser that did not leave makeup on my towel when drying.</li>
            <li> wipe it off with a warm wet</li>
            <li> and I actually like it better, for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped so fast from Korea!</li>
            <li> After cleaning with a cleanser, face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Gets all of your make-up off the first time without leaving your face feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> This is a product I absolutely can&#x27;t do without!  </li>
            <li> Smells and feels exactly like the olive oil you find in your kitchen.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it really does remove makeup and mascara (of any genre)!  </li>
            <li> I simply need to get more info about the product&#x27;s ingredients to find out if I want to continue using it.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Have tried many others, but I always come back to this one - it even gently removes water-proof makeup!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling more moisturized afterward than regular facewash.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the first skin care product that my 20 y. o. son has enthusiastically used every day</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> love the product and use is daily.</li>
            <li> This bottle will probably last me for a year or more.</li>
            <li> This is truly my first review on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and my skin is so clean and soft after!</li>
            <li> Very effective in cleansing my face and is gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, effective and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this cleans off all the makeup and rinses right off.</li>
            <li> I love this product; it foams a little and then rinses off easily unlike pure olive oil.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin completely clean and clear.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin clear and clean.</li>
            <li> After you pat it dry, its clean and smooth, and its not drying.</li>
            <li> This stuff rinses off clean and leaves skin feeling soft and hydrated but not oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> After using it, my face feels clean, but not stripped of its natural moisture.  </li>
            <li> the sensation of rubbing oil on your face takes some getting used to, but the way it makes your skin feel SO SOFT and CLEAN...</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face feeling refreshingly clean but not &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; of all its natural oils.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Your face feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and really clean, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil leaves your face clean AND soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and soft afterward and NO oily residue.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and clean but not stripped of moisture after usage.</li>
            <li> There is some sort of ruddy residue left afterwards that I still have to wash my face with a cleanser, so I believe this is mostly good only as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was more portable, though -- once you open it,  can&#x27;t really pack it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to find a makeup remover that takes off as much of your makeup as possible.</li>
            <li> Like, if someone touched my face I&#x27;d tell them to be careful with what else they touched before they &#x27; washed hands, so with that being said this stuff takes it off very easily.</li>
            <li> I was very scared &amp; hesitant to try this cleansing oil because I have very very oily skin.</li>
            <li> It removes the heaviest of mascara &amp; eye makeup &amp; makes your face feel clean but not tight.</li>
            <li> Face is clean but not tight with zero residue.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to remove sunscreen and makeup and thought I would give this a try because of all the positive reviews...BIG mistake.</li>
            <li> When its first applied its very oily.</li>
            <li> (Also, you&#x27;re smearing The Enemy on your face which made me really hesitant and nervous at first.)  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve noticed my skin being and staying much softer and its so much easier to shave my face after using this!</li>
            <li> At first I was using this straight without water except for washing off...</li>
            <li> It arrived in 3 days as the promise, and it as good as the past.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, very little scent, a little goes a very long way, and all my makeup comes off with a good massage and a good rinse with water.  </li>
            <li> I find it a slight annoyance, but do find this product removes water proof mascara better than any product I&#x27;ve used (and done so in a quick manner).  </li>
            <li> This not only dissolves my makeup but leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh as well as pampered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I get acne due to clogged pores and skin-producing oil very easily.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other makeup removers but nothing works better, I would definitely recommend this product !!</li>
            <li> but once you add water it dissolves right away leaving to sticky oily residue - clean and supple skin only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the OCM (Oil Cleansing Method - just a mix of oils right out of the pantry) and it was a no-go because it would not wash clean away and always left residue that DID clog my pores.</li>
            <li> If you use it right, clean it thoroughly afterward, you will definitely see how well it will work on your skin.</li>
            <li> I work it in, especially around my eyes, and then clean it off with a warm, wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you follow the instructions to use it on dry skin and then rinse off.</li>
            <li> This is so simple, moisturizes well, and washes off easily with water, which I did not expect.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use it with dry hands, then rinse with water.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup and leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> , it cleans all the eyeliner, mascara and eye shadow mildly and completely.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I had my doubts about DHC Cleanser, since I have super sensitive skin and nothing seems to agree with it; that is until now.  </li>
            <li> I have super oily and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I also keep it by my sink and use one single drop to wash my hands after putting on BB cream or make-up that applies better by hand/fingertips than brush.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly  use it again.</li>
            <li> Pure olive oil will give you some resistance</li>
            <li> Not to mention it smells wonderful and leaves my mature skin without making it feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li> like this product out of the whole line and would recommend this as a starter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great starter oil with hundreds of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I wear waterproof mascara everyday and this oil leaves no residue, i&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> This product removes all makeup, including eye makeup easily, rinses off completely, and leaves the skin soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> It also feels like a more natural clean than a lot of other products.  </li>
            <li> You can easily write to them for a sample of the dhc deep cleansing oil and get a free sample if you are unsure of buying a big bottle.</li>
            <li> It felt a little filmy on my skin when I didn&#x27;t use face wash afterwards, so I don&#x27;t use it on its own.    </li>
            <li> Not only did it leave my pores squeeky clean (I have used masks, pore cleansers, nose strips that were just &amp;#34;o.k.&amp;#34;), but it melted off my waterproof mascara and gel liner like melted butter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey compared to making your own oil cleanser, but he really likes it and it makes his skin look glowy.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean and fresh with being overly dry.</li>
            <li> the purified Japanese oil gently and lightly suds and leaves no oily finish after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> My favourite part of using this is when I apply it on my face I can really feel the bits of dirt and flakes scrub away when I massage it around my face, it opens up the dirt in the pores and my face feels much smoother afterwards.</li>
            <li> It does work very well though.</li>
            <li> and here it is even cheap in china with the same qulity....</li>
            <li> This cleanser removes all traces of makeup, even mascara with gentle massaging and water.</li>
            <li> I then take my index fingers and rub horizontally over my lashes and eyes to really dissolve the mascara.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough to anyone looking for a gentle, yet unbelievably effective facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It really works well on mascara.</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Every time you make a purchase at DHC, you can select 4 free samples from an extensive list of choices.</li>
            <li> then its much easier to use.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li> Then I use a half-pump on my pointer fingers, and gently place them on my eyes; I let the oil sink in to remove stubborn mascara and eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> IT IS NOT GREASY BECAUSE IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE MUCH TO MOISTURIZE MY WHOLE FACE.  </li>
            <li> I use many diff ones and spent alot of money</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle and gets even the toughest makeup off.</li>
            <li> thank you so much.</li>
            <li> and I almost bought Shu Umera&#x27;s, but I couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much money on it.</li>
            <li> Because this really is oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does remove makeup very well.</li>
            <li> thanks so much.</li>
            <li> It removes all your makeup and really cleans and moisturizes your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had skin problems my whole life</li>
            <li> Can wash face as much as you like without drying out.  </li>
            <li> I use one pump on my whole face and swirl it around for a minute or two then rinse with water.</li>
            <li> It goes on like an oil, then when you add water turns to a gentle soap.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> my shipping is free and 2nd day delivery with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I do prefer the colors available from Cover Girl/Olay face makeup, but everything else I use on my skin, including the terrific lip cream, is made by DHC.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My skin feel clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li> The price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> It is really oily.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using another face wash which is supposed to be gentle and hydrating.  </li>
            <li> This cleansing oil can remove the makeup very well, but my skin feels so oily after using it.</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up this bottle because of this breakout incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take too much to get my face</li>
            <li> Too much oil on your hands</li>
            <li> It removes eye make up but is really gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> so a gentle cleanser is what I need</li>
            <li> It gently removes EVERY trace of make-up, no scrubbing involved.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit steep in cost, but really clears off makeup</li>
            <li> I always follow it with a gentle cleanser to remove any traces of the oil and sunscreen and/or makeup.</li>
            <li> I have read absolutely every review on this product on amazon and all I could find via google.&lt;br</li>
            <li> research I&#x27;ve done makes so much sense I will share it with you:&lt;br /&gt;Oil</li>
            <li> I like the oil products, they really do the job.</li>
            <li> It also removed make-up really well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for 3 months and at this rate it will last at least 6 more months, so I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li> Reasonable priced product that does the job.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to try the Julep brand but couldn&#x27;t spend the money.  </li>
            <li> and I only wore light make up.</li>
            <li> It really cleans off all my makeup without overdrying my face.  </li>
            <li> So now, at night I use 2 pumps of DHC cleansing oil for 60 seconds, then I would wash with the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Foam Cleanser for 30 seconds and then apply my 1/2 pump of Cetaphil lotion.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet through.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to use a cleanser afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I use it as part of a multistep cleaning regimen, and it&#x27;s really helped improve my skins texture and reduced breakouts.</li>
            <li> Removes mineral and waterproof makeup very well.</li>
            <li> It really does what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> Does its job very well.</li>
            <li> Really cleans all my make up off</li>
            <li> It takes the make up off really well.</li>
            <li> your vision will be very blurry....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a about a year - works very well.  </li>
            <li> With this, you really need to read the directions on how to use.  </li>
            <li> I like the way my face feels after using it - clean to the touch, but not greasy and not dry.  </li>
            <li> It depends on how prone you are to break-outs and how much $$ you want to spend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the real surprise is how fast this will remove all of your make up.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing after peels and retin A.</li>
            <li> Even when I got to my eyes, I just gently massaged  and I could feel my mascara falling apart.</li>
            <li> The oil gives me the needed moisture to keep my skin looking fresh and young.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have minimal ingredients (which I like), does what it is intended to do, &amp; more.  </li>
            <li> I think it takes off foundation very well and think it would work well for all kinds of skin.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE MY SKIN STILL IS VERY DAMAGE</li>
            <li> I recommend using steam/hot water and a washcloth to really remove it.</li>
            <li> I use it now when I need to take eye makeup off or am in a hurry to cleanse at night and don&#x27;t want to go through my whole routine.  </li>
            <li> reason I really recommend it is because it&#x27;s so gentles and doesn&#x27;t break out or irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Feel clean and not dry.</li>
            <li> but it works really to remove make up .</li>
            <li> High quality!</li>
            <li> Product shipped fast and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Absolutely will always have this product in my arsenal of products to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I have skin on the drier side, but not too much.  </li>
            <li> Sincerely,i recommend this one to everyone who wants to have her up removal well-done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to rinse than the at home cleanser</li>
            <li> Extremely effective make up remover without being harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li> More often than not I find myself reaching for my Cetaphil, facial cleansing wipes or my Lush cleanser.</li>
            <li> You may think that oil will make you breakout more, but this takes off all of my makeup (including eye makeup), cleanses deeply, and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels baby soft after use and I believe overall my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> It also has a subtle herbal scent that&#x27;s really pleasant without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as usual!</li>
            <li> It rinses right off and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> It took everything off including my waterproof mascara and left my skin soft and very clean.  </li>
            <li> It makes taking my makeup off after a long and tiring day SO easy.</li>
            <li> gentle enough and clean make up very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it washes away cleanly with warm water leaving no oily feeling behind.  </li>
            <li> It rinses completely, has no fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> this cleanser yanks make up right off your face, and it actually leaves your skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin that is prone to breakouts with most products I try.</li>
            <li> The Olive Oil moisturizer , the Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, the facial masks, Velvet Skin Coat.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip my skin like so many other products I have used.</li>
            <li> and this has helped control it better than any other product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love this product.</li>
            <li> received a sample of this as most other folks who have reviewed have been introduced to the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other cleansers that make my skin look like I have rubbed it with sandpaper, but when I am done cleaning my skin with this product it looks like I have already put on my skin cream for the night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the original before, and the one I received looks and feels quite different.</li>
            <li> Soap will dry the skin further and your face will produce more oil!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Removes makeup, washes off clean and face feels soft but not tight and overdried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was not at all oily and my face was left squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and my pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li> I go pretty heavy on eye makeup and this is magical.  </li>
            <li> while it seems totally counterintuitive to use oil to clean your face, it WORKS</li>
            <li> Leaving my face clean for the next step in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> The result is that my face feels deeply clean and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li> This miraculously cleans my face of EVERYTHING yet rinses thoroughly clean when washed after with my facial cleansing.</li>
            <li> Not an exfoliator, but it leaves skin feeling refreshed and clean for your cleanser, toner, serum, whatever you&#x27;re going to do next.</li>
            <li> Every time I have makeup, even I only have BB cream on my face, I would use the DHC cleaning oil to clean my face.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra money to have a product that absolutely does not dry skin, yet rinses clean off afterward.</li>
            <li> The only things I dislike is that the pump dispenses a bit too much at a time, and I find that I end up using up the product quite quickly.</li>
            <li> The cleansing oil is mainly just to remove my makeup, but it&#x27;s probably not 100% necessary because the oil does make your skin feel squeaky clean after you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to remove even eye makeup, but leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Amazing that it&#x27;s an oil as I usually stay away from anything with &#x27;oil&#x27; in it.  </li>
            <li> the only problem may be the low capacity only 3 or 4 month for me, but it is good</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to disturb my skin&#x27;s moisture barrier too much; all I need is my normal night cream after I use it.</li>
            <li> Yes, DHC products are a bit expensive, but you get what you pay for and you can&#x27;t replace beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot live with out this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue trying new DHC products!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I feel like this product didn&#x27;t live up to the hype because I have found other products that work just as well or even better.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and this cleanser leaves it smooth and silky</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> The main ingredient is olive oil</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh with no harsh chemicals or perfumes.    </li>
            <li> I have been using the DHC oil for years and years and it has never broken me out, clogged my pores, or dried my skin more.</li>
            <li> Leaves me skin clean and soft (not dry).  </li>
            <li> The most recent face wash I started using was a generic brand of proactiv.</li>
            <li> After trying just about every cleanser out there, and still not finding anything that would help me get clear, acny free skin, I finally gave up and stopped using all the stuff I have been putting on my face.</li>
            <li> I have never found anything that does such a good job getting all of the make up off without being harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> A must-have for ladies (and gents) who wear a classic pancake makeup face.</li>
            <li> Only con is that I feel like it runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> makeup off quickly and totally!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to older women -</li>
            <li> this gentile when I was in high school when I really needed it instead of all the super harsh chemicals I thought I needed to get my acne/ super oily skin to behave.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and fresh afterwards and NOT tight, oily or irritated.  </li>
            <li> The bottle has lasted me a long time, and one squirt is more than enough to cleanse your whole face.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend product and seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend this to all</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommand this... and it doesn&#x27;t break me out...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but I gave it a try anyway because of the high rating.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product by DHC.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> I have suffered with acne/sensitive skin since high school and use make up to cover up.</li>
            <li> High grade oil cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend using this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of cleansers over the years, high end and drug store alike</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It removed every last drop of make up off my face, and left my skin feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I try other products when I get samples, but this is by far my favorite face cleanser.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to remove all make-up but gentle enough for taking off eye make-up.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice, delicate, long lasting bottle of the most thorough, gentle cleanser ever.  </li>
            <li> gave it two stars because it really does deep clean and made my skin feel great after using it (especially compared to regular facial cleansers) minus the cysts of course.</li>
            <li> gave it two stars because it really does deep clean and made my skin feel great after using it (especially compared to regular facial cleansers) minus the cysts of course.</li>
            <li> (less costly) and maybe even attempt to make one on my own (2 parts castor, 1 part EVOO, teaspoon of essential oils such as tea tree, eucalyptus, sweet orange)</li>
            <li> Skin feels so soft!!  </li>
            <li> I wish it smelled a little better...</li>
            <li> right before I step in I pump 2 full pumps into my DRY hands, rub my hands together fast to kinda warm up the oil and then apply it to my DRY face and start rubbing small circles all around my face &amp; eye area</li>
            <li> You apply it dry, just rub it all over your face, and it rinses clean.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin and sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I have used many kinds of facial cleansers and facial products from lower-priced drug store cleansers to expensive-department products, which are well liked by higher-end users, to a few Asian products.</li>
            <li> One is supposed to put it on dry face to clean all the make-up/dirty residues off.</li>
            <li> I was so confused when I first used this product because all the reviews were amazing</li>
            <li> this product really cleans but leaves your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> when I use it directly on dry clean and rub it around for about 15 seconds before washing off with water.</li>
            <li> Note to massage it directly onto your skin and not to use water until you are ready to rinse it off your face.</li>
            <li> but it is still gentle and does not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are so natural &amp; gentle</li>
            <li> To use, pump onto clean dry hands and rub all over your face.</li>
            <li> I have never stuck with any cleanser this long as most don&#x27;t work or only</li>
            <li> I have normal skin with an oily T-Zone.</li>
            <li> Then if I quit using it for a few days, it is quite lovely for another three days.</li>
            <li> This is better than any harsh makeup remover you could buy.</li>
            <li> I rarely get breakouts on my face, only 1 or two before/during my cycle)</li>
            <li> He has not complained and he has been satisified with the product.  </li>
            <li> I do wear the basic waterproof mascara, foundation, setting powder, etc, and using this as the first step of my cleaning process works very well.</li>
            <li> Most work well for a few weeks, sometimes a month or two, and then my skin becomes irritated and rosacea &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; prone.  </li>
            <li> use this product strictly as makeup remover, NOT as my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li> After that, I continue on with my normal skincare routine (cleanser, toner, moisturizer, spot treatment, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wash my face with my normal face wash</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and use every night.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bosia (which you can buy at Ulta) is a little thicker, so it doesn&#x27;t spread and glide over your eye area as fast or easily as the DHC and for the price, the bottle is a lot</li>
            <li> After going through all my DHC catalog samples, I had to break down and finally buy this product because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I read several more reviews about this cleansing oil, turns out I massaged it on my face for too long and that was why my skin got irritated by all the circular massaging motion on my chin!</li>
            <li> I just finished off with a toner and my once lengthy makeup-removal routine was shortened by more than half the time!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser  especially if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Really takes all make-up off very softly and leaving fade so soft and with a glow.</li>
            <li> I only need 1 or two pumps and it rinses right off.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that when I massage my face with this for a minute or two, tiny blackheads come right out.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate, and this makes a big difference, and also helps my moisturizers to work better.  </li>
            <li> It did seem a little strange, using a cleansing \\&quot;oil\\&quot; to clean the oily areas of my face which are prone to break-outs, but this formula is so light, rinses completely and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily feel, only clean softness.</li>
            <li> It removes make up very very well, won&#x27;t dry skin like most other foaming like cleaners.</li>
            <li> It took all my make up off and leaving my face squeaky clean, but not stripped dry!</li>
            <li> Awesome cleanser, the only small drawback is that it stings a little in the eyes, but I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> my original one has ABSOLUTELY NO RESIDUE</li>
            <li> I put a little on my hands, emulsified it between my fingers and started applying it directly to my face and my many layers of makeup just melted away.</li>
            <li> I usually use one pump straight on dry skin, and work it gently for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, and then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> and i can&#x27;t live without this now.</li>
            <li> and I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to oil cleansers and have tried this and Murad.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of natural oils and gets makeup off easily with a few rubs.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and it is just what I needed for my dry winter skin in Michigan.</li>
            <li> clean the face totally and not dry</li>
            <li> After rinsing, it&#x27;s important to wash with regular facial soap.</li>
            <li> normally use this as my first cleanser followed by a regular ph balanced cleanser&lt;br /&gt;sometimes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and feel that most cleansers are too harsh.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, but that has not been as much as a problem as it was for me when I was younger - - as an actor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to have a deep facial cleanser to protect my skin.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that my eye makeup doesn&#x27;t come off very easily</li>
            <li> very natural , no chemicals; my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> It has a neutral olive smell, very gentle on the skin &amp; eyes, a bottle will last you 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Just leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li> I have in the past with adequate success</li>
            <li> it is not expensive, it lasts quite a while, and I cannot remember what I used before, but I know whatever it was, it left my face irritated - forgot to mention I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> SO SOFT AFT USING CLEANSER!</li>
            <li> I normally order directly from DHC because you get a loyalty customer discount and it helps.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time i have ordered from Amazon,so i have yet to see if the consistency is different or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as the first step in a double cleanse routine in the evening</li>
            <li> I have been buying it for  5 years direct from the company but ran out and needed it faster, thank goodness for prime!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and fell in love with cleansing oils (once I discovered how they work, I tried several other brands).</li>
            <li> I use this as my first step in the double cleansing method.</li>
            <li> I used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li> is pretty simple.</li>
            <li> First step in Asian face care.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleans your face the first time and does not leave it oily and it keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of other facial cleansers, but this one is my favorite by far!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but with your normal oily T zone.</li>
            <li> It has also helped my &amp;#34;way too old to be getting&amp;#34; acne!</li>
            <li> This product excels as a first step in facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is only retailer that seems to stock it consistently.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have those raccoon eyes after washing anymore (despite heavy eyeliner usage) because this stuff really melts it all away clean.  </li>
            <li> The last time I purchased this product, it didn&#x27;t leave the same clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> The oil is really light with a thin consistency and washes cleanly off the face.</li>
            <li> It feels like such a deep clean</li>
            <li> If you wear light eye makeup this takes it right off but with heavy mascara (my guilty favorite!)</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product, however, this particular bottle I received recently has oil of which consistency, texture, color and smell are very different from my previously purchased ones.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that this one is imitation brand goods!!!</li>
            <li> I have pretty normal skin, and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the idea of an oil based cleanser was weird, but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It does not dry your skin and is really gentle on your eyes.</li>
            <li> As to the Deep Cleansing Oil itself, I like that it dissolves all of my make-up and is easy to use, but I (weirdly) find it a bit drying and need to moisturize and exfoliate more often than normal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She claimed that it really cleansed her face and did not dry her skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> First and only product I&#x27;ve ever used that has removed my make up completely.</li>
            <li> At night, I usually use a toner just to make sure all the makeup and anything else is completely washed off before using a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Have allergies to many products due to perfumes and other additives, this is pure and does not cause any discomfort or itching.  </li>
            <li> but my skin kind of changes into a little dry during fall and winter...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, have tried tone of skin care, so far no irritation on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cuts down on so many facial regiments.  </li>
            <li> I never knew a cleanser could make such a positive difference.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few weeks of consistent use, but my face broke out worse than I think I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever had and my face now in a better condition that it has been in the last half a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to putting this on my dry face with dry hands, but it cleans well, rinses off easily, and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft without the tightness that other cleansers cause.  </li>
            <li> you, its amazing at removing every last bit of makeup- sticky foundation, mascaras and every other strange thing we can put on our face.</li>
            <li> So the oil breaks down all your makeup &amp; dirt and this product rinses clean</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any change in general redness, but I would still highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I finally got a little better.</li>
            <li> Then I add water, massage a little more and then rinse it off and have ZERO traces of makeup left.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried a couple of DHC&#x27;s other formulas - a mild version and the pore cleanser.</li>
            <li> I think the DHC one is probably the best because of the size of the bottle in relation to the price, the natural low-odor scent (which is basically none, so you know it&#x27;s not loaded with crap chemicals),</li>
            <li> One pump of DHC is enough to get it all off - before washing my face at night, I rub it directly on my eyelids with my fingers without any water, rinse, then wash my whole face with face wash.</li>
            <li> like this product, the reason I got was because I read an article on Cosmo about how oil helps remove dirt and clear blackheads on your face.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks my face began to clear up.</li>
            <li> But then, after a few days of using the oil, I developed the largest, most painful cystic acne breakout I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Can remove make-up clearly.  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean (which is odd since this is oil).</li>
            <li> Clinque is clear and this is an olive oil color and smell.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin so soft and well prepped for a cleanser.</li>
            <li> your skin really soft</li>
            <li> Although the directions state not to apply directly to eyes, I have to chuckle, because I need to get my mascara off, and in the process, the product enters my eye.  </li>
            <li> It does the job on waterproof make-up and leaves your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> Those with sensitive eyes or contact wearers may want to proceed with caution, but again, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with eye irritation.</li>
            <li> As a side note my skin is sensitive and I get headaches from overly scented products but have had no problems with this stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft that I almost don&#x27;t feel like I need to put lotion on afterwards</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li> It dissolves every trace of makeup completely.</li>
            <li> I can only use the gentlest cleansers and sometimes even the ones that are marketed as gentle sting when I put them on my skin.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, I follow up with a gentle face cleanser such as Cetaphil to thoroughly remove any leftover residue.</li>
            <li> It rinses completely off.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely come back again!</li>
            <li> with soft skin and no wrinkles...</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and am in my early 30s.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce]] to remove all the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then I use witch hazel as a toner, and then apply 100% all natural argan oil on my eyes, face, neck, and chest at night.</li>
            <li> This cleans my sensitive skin (Rosacea)</li>
            <li> This product completely cleanses my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Nothing I have used removes makeup and sunscreen so completely.</li>
            <li> It feels completely water soluable.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup (including the eye area) completely.  </li>
            <li> but it leave it soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It requires a follow up cleanser to really remove the last of the oily makeup residue.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> He has naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> and this does not increase the natural oil from my skin.</li>
            <li> Your face stays soft and the skin gets moisturized.  </li>
            <li> , I used to order directly from DHC, since I am a prime member</li>
            <li> without stripping my skin it gently removes all of the above stated</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Does the job of completely taking off my makeup.</li>
            <li> The deal breaker for me was I used it near my eyes to remove makeup it burned and irritated my eyes even after rinsing with water.  </li>
            <li> i use a gentle facial wash afterward...</li>
            <li> DHC has a product designed for moisturizing but as far as I can tell there&#x27;s no reason not to just use the cleansing oil for moisture as well,</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s Old Faithful for me.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin velvety soft and his not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Contains natural ingredients and works so well.  </li>
            <li> It cleans off the make-up and my skin has never felt so soft.  </li>
            <li> A week later, my skin is so much cleaner, acne is fading (even a spot that has been on my face for about a year) and my face looks radiant.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and have been using this for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> It really goes into the pores and helps with my daily exfoliation!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of it that I got in the mail and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> I am not a heavy makeup wearer, so I don&#x27;t know how well this would work for them.</li>
            <li> Make-up melts off, leaving my skin soft as silk.</li>
            <li> My sensitive, rosacea skin loves this product.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It removes all my makeup - face and eye, and after I use it my skin is soft and almost transluscent.  </li>
            <li> but it came completely off.</li>
            <li> It cleanses my face and eye make-up thoroughly, with ease, and leaves the face feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> have combination/oily and relatively sensitive skin and this does not break me out or irritate me at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well it worked, so I ordered here.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I was worried this would just contribute to the excess oil, it did the opposite!</li>
            <li> It rinses completely.</li>
            <li> It completely removes mascara and makeup, it completely rinses away.</li>
            <li> By the end of the facial cleanse, it was like the oil had turned into an exfoliating scrub because it had pulled out so much gunk that the oil turned grainy.</li>
            <li> I find it a bit drying though for my 50+ year old skin.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin types should use with caution.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> When I wash it off, the oil turns milky and my face is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> It completely removes all of my makeup including all waterproof eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it for mature skin also since you are not pulling on your skin during washing.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product leaves my skin soft and dewy looking.</li>
            <li> The initial feel of oil on my face is a bit disconcerting, but the oil really washes off with water.</li>
            <li> Apply directly to face (don&#x27;t add water until you have massaged it thoroughly into your face).  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Ok...I&#x27;m old.  </li>
            <li> and it always feels soft after.  </li>
            <li> The benefit is my skin feels velvety soft.  </li>
            <li> After trying a sample of DHC I knew that this product fixed my concerns with the homemade stuff.  </li>
            <li> Completely cleans your face and leaves no trace of makeup.</li>
            <li> this japanese oil remover I have used for several years, and it is useful for me.</li>
            <li> I really love all products purchased from this line - a bit expensive but well worth it</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil is similar to the Shu Uemura brand&#x27;s cleansing oil, but much more affordable for everyday use.</li>
            <li> and effectively made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the first one I&#x27;ve found that actually leaves my skin feeling soft, not dry.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves my face feeling clean, but not squeaky and tight.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, there will be some trace amounts of my makeup left on the cotton ball when I use toner, but it is significantly better than any other makeup remover I have used to date.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You massage it onto a dry face for a minute or two and then hold a steaming hot washcloth on your face.</li>
            <li> More expensive than a bar of soap, and much more long lasting, too.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and non irritating, leaving skin feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I used it before I hop in the shower:pump it once to get some product in my dry hand, gently spread it on my face, gently massage it into my face using circular motion, and I only do this for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> DHC does carry a small travel size pump bottle, but I find it&#x27;s more convenient to just carry the sample size packets on short business</li>
            <li> DHC Deep Cleansing Oil feels exactly like extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li> It removes my everyday makeup pretty much in one go.</li>
            <li> just ordered my first bottle because after finally using my sample last night- all of my 32 pimples but 1</li>
            <li> I have yet to find makeup that this product doesn&#x27;t completely remove - heavy eyeliner, longlasting lipstick, full coverage foundation, you name it.</li>
            <li> actually so does the main ingredient in this, which is olive oil.....</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil completely removes makeup the way no other product I have tried has.  </li>
            <li> but it rinses off my face completely leaving behind moist, fresh, CLEAN skin that is ready for my second cleanser to reach deep into</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right consistency where the other was too runny.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t know how easily it removes heavy foundations as I don&#x27;t wear beyond sheer coverage/tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> and I find my oil production is more balanced because other cleansers especially foaming ones dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike plain olive oil, it emulsifies and rinses clean</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, I put a small amount of this product in my hand and then lightly massage it on my face and neck to cut the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Or if you order through DHC, you can get free sample-size packets which I usually save up for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combo dry/oily + sensitive skin and don&#x27;t wear makeup generally.</li>
            <li> This is my first time I spent the time to rate anything I have purchased online.</li>
            <li> arrived promptly, was exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> only downside I have found is that the normal 6.7 oz.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just about the only thing that makes my 70 year old face feel young!  </li>
            <li> I wear makeup almost every day because I have a lot of acne scarring/acne that I&#x27;m not comfortable going out with without a full face of foundation/BB cream.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean off and afterwards my face is a bit tight, but not dry.</li>
            <li> Now, as far as it being an oil (olive oil based), it rinsed off thoroughly and quickly with just plain water.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> DHC can easily remove everything off without rubbing your eyes so hard.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without my DHC Deep Cleansing Oil!  </li>
            <li> Rub your hands together and gently massage onto your dry face.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or aging skin I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this may be too drying for you, but it works very well on combination to oily</li>
            <li> Really works well to help problem areas of dry skin around my nose.  </li>
            <li> Deep cleansing provides the extra moisture with gentle cleansing.  </li>
            <li> oil cleanser was created to react with water when comes in contact to become a milky liquid which washes completely off skin, leaving skin soft at the same time (Not over-drying).</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> Your face feels so soft and never dry</li>
            <li> Used it once and couldn&#x27;t reorder my DHC Deep Cleansing Oil fast enough.  </li>
            <li> best gentle and nourishing cleanser: doesn&#x27;t have nasty mineral oil.</li>
            <li> Most reviews are good but some are terrible.  </li>
            <li> Feels very natural and organic, like a facial with every face wash.</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive to eye makeup remover, but this product not only takes it all off but doesn&#x27;t sting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin no longer has oily and dry days, it&#x27;s all very normal.</li>
            <li> It removes make-up like no other.  </li>
            <li> It cleans like no other.</li>
            <li> So I finally finished my first bottle of DHC Deep Cleansing Oil after using it to remove my makeup daily for over a 1 year and a half!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> B002VAZINQ Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System - White]] and alternate with [[ASIN:B0009ET4QI Beauty Without Cruelty Facial Cleansing Milk, Extra Gentle 8.5fl oz]], which is another very gentile and natural facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few makeup removers in the past but nothing has ever worked to really take most of it off.</li>
            <li> The breakouts were pretty much all over face: my chin, a bit on my cheeks, along each side of my nose, all over my upper lip and a few on my forehead.</li>
            <li> The breakouts were pretty much all over face: my chin, a bit on my cheeks, along each side of my nose, all over my upper lip and a few on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Takes off my makeup like no other product.</li>
            <li> It certainly does not make my face tight or stripped of oil, it just feels normal after usage.  </li>
            <li> VERY SOOTHING FOR DRY SKIN!</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne (starting to improve with my new skincare cleansing routines!)</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and all soap regardless of how gentle, dries my face.</li>
            <li> little pricy but worth it</li>
            <li> Eye make-up remover almost always gets in your eyes a little or is absorbed through the lid.</li>
            <li> have been using DHC Deep Cleansing Oil for a while now, but back in March I decided to order it from this particular seller.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clean (no residue that needs to be wiped away with toner), soft and not at all dry or tight.</li>
            <li> Water based oil free cleansers that contain basic, and even no soap or detergents, DO NOT bond with the excess oil, they instead completely strip the skin of ALL oils and leave the skin tight and dry.</li>
            <li> generally lasts me 9-12 months.</li>
            <li> Every time I made up, it help me to remove the made up clearly and instantly.</li>
            <li> Gently rub over face and closed eyes.</li>
            <li> I have only ever been traumatized by what oil does to my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Two reasons:  it still irritates my unusually sensitive skin (especially around the eyes) and it is pricey.  </li>
            <li> 44 year old fickle, mixed complexion skin and cleanser no longer likes my skin.  </li>
            <li> Back to the DHC oil- does not make me break out and it leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> It got through my mascara completely and left my skin feeling supple.</li>
            <li> B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]]</li>
            <li> and I really liked it, but it was solo expensive.</li>
            <li> Then add a little water, which will give it a very slight foaming action, and massage some more, then rinse.  </li>
            <li> I have my mom with normal skin on this cleanser, my aunt with sensitive skin, my grandmother with dry skin, and myself with combo/acne prone skin (formerly oil) on it.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for several years to remove makeup, and occasionally to moisturize my face (I live in the desert).</li>
            <li> , I have very very acne prone skin and was attempting other things besides proactive but had to go back to proactive</li>
            <li> we are all dirty and although this is sold primary as a makeup remover oil cleansing is SUPER EFFECTIVE!!&lt;br /&gt;the oil cleansing idea</li>
            <li> I have a few large, dark acne scars around my chin that are still there and will take a few more months to completely heal and fade away.</li>
            <li> I have a few large, dark acne scars around my chin that are still there and will take a few more months to completely heal and fade away.</li>
            <li> , maybe they just did not use it in the right way since there is no directions on the bottle or in the box, I usually use 2 pumps and rub it on my whole face, I suggest that do not wet your face or hands before using this, you can wash your hands and dry them before you use this product.</li>
            <li> I apply this right to my [heavily made up] eyes at the end of the day, and my makeup washes away.</li>
            <li> I have tried other expensive Japanese face oils and the oddly greasy Eve Lom, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li> However, it can make your vision oddly blurry, which freaked me out at first.  </li>
            <li> But generally I use it with a gentle cleanser like recommended by other users.</li>
            <li> I usually follow it up with a mild cleanser</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy, but you certainly get what you paid for!</li>
            <li> I follow with Cereve Foaming Facial Cleanser to thoroughly clean my skin, then apply my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I follow it up with my usual face wash to get extra clean skin.</li>
            <li> For make-up on other parts of your face, of course it works very well too.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves my otherwise dull gray looking skin so clean and glowing after using it.</li>
            <li> and I thought the bottle would be a little bigger considering the price, but it&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li> I am the type that will always go to bed with a clean face no matter what (late night partying, Vegas, etc.).  </li>
            <li> Took me at least five clean cotton pads to be done.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to use much; I use mine at least once a day</li>
            <li> but I was able to use it at least for 6 months til the bottle went empty, so I kept on buying it.</li>
            <li> it really works in removing makeup, not much for mascaras or waterproof eyeliners, there would still be some residue left even after cleaning it with this</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my face.</li>
            <li> this does not dry out your face</li>
            <li> It saves me time and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It feels a little weird to use at first, but my skin has never felt so soft, healthy, and</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that breaks out and fluctuates between oily and dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and find that many cleansers left my skin dry and tight feeling, especially during the winter.  </li>
            <li> It balances my skin like no other facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this cleansing oil for anyone who has extremely dry facial skin!</li>
            <li> This was disappointing because I wanted to like this after hearing other peoples great reviews.</li>
            <li> generally follow this up with a second wash with [[ASIN:B000052ZB2</li>
            <li> Other gentle cleanser cannot remove all of my make-up, such as eye shadow and mascara.</li>
            <li> I have used other cleaning oils that have felt heavy, sticky, or even like the product was pulling on my skin as I  tried to smooth the oil over my face.  </li>
            <li> Follow this up with an other cleanser as this really meant to remove makeup and daily grime.</li>
            <li> first few times I used it, it did not go well.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this oil, it caused me acne on my face.</li>
            <li> , I think the large bottle was less than $15 there.</li>
            <li> Massage it into dry skin (it really does need to be dry) and then rinse off with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> What I have found is that it works very well at breaking down and removing my make up at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It left my face very soft but dry if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li> I always used cleansers that left my skin more on the dry side - but not a good thing when skin starts showing the signs of age.</li>
            <li> Not sure I got the right product.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The beauty of this cleanser is you can use it if you have oily, dry, sensitive, or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;moisturizes and made my old dry skin look</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive, dry skin like me, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> That said, if you use it correctly (directly onto dry skin, then rinse with water)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes all my makeup off and leave the skin soft, does not irritate or dry.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions completely, rubbing it onto dry skin and rinsing thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It was very comparable and slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> yet I find that I don&#x27;t need nearly as much moisturizer as with previous cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I typically have oily skin and was concerned it would be too much...</li>
            <li> Recently I began using Estée Lauder double wear make up, and realized that, while it lasts all day long (a good thing), it was also very difficult to remove completely at night.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a very long way, which makes the price seem worth it.  </li>
            <li> When you put it in your hands it sort of runs down your palm and onto your wrist if you don&#x27;t use it fast enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used more expensive cleansing oils such as Shu Umura and Bobby Brown and the DHC does exactly the same job at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Have always had skin that was in that category of not-terrible-but-never-great:  Not a broken out mess, but sort of oily, always one or two blemishes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I noticed I had some cleanser left on my old bottle and NOTICED SOMETHING  VERY STRANGE.....</li>
            <li> I occasionally will use a toner before applying the moisturizer but toners tend to dry the skin and defeats the purpose of using a oil soap to maintain the natural oils in your skin.</li>
            <li> than anything I&#x27;ve tried previously, you don&#x27;t use as much, so it really isn&#x27;t any more expensive.  </li>
            <li> it can not clean very good&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> I feel like it cleanses my face a little too much, and that is a</li>
            <li> I tested this new bottle of oil against the other bottle that I purchased from an authorized seller,SkinCareRx (by DHC, officially).  </li>
            <li> I use a separate eye makeup remover first to take off my eyeliner/mascara; then, while my face and hands are dry, I use about 1 and a half pumps of the oil and rub my entire face (avoiding the eye area) for about 20-30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It takes me literally less than 3 minutes to clean my face with heavy, water-proof make-up -</li>
            <li> Second, the plain olive oil did not rinse off very well.</li>
            <li> It all just comes right off without leaving that tight feeling on the skin that a lot of other soap-based cleansers do.</li>
            <li> : Do not wet your hands or face before, dry is the way.</li>
            <li> DRY - do not wet your hands or your face.  </li>
            <li> For the past 4 months I gave been using Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Foam Cleanser and Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion (only a moderate amount of 1/2 pump for my entire face) day and night.</li>
            <li> As a 50 year old female with eczema and irish sensitive skin, this feels glorious and gets off every bit of my full-face everyday makeup!</li>
            <li> Due to my sensitive skin and history of breakouts</li>
            <li> This stuff fell so flat that I tried to sell what I had left on ebay.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin that gets really tight and dry without moisturizer but gets really greasy on my nose.</li>
            <li> So once I finished my previous bottles while I was on vacation I started using my new one from this seller.  </li>
            <li> It felt very greasy, which is not consistent with any other bottle I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I apply thing dry with my fingers, massage in then wipe off with a cotton round, then use my philosophy cleanser or purpose and my skin is soft soft.</li>
            <li> I only wear long lasting, water proof makeup, as I work 12 to 18 hour shifts routinely.</li>
            <li> In  addition to the large bottle I have purchased the small travel size which meets TSA restrictions.  </li>
            <li> It has cleared up dry patches while at the same time reducing the shine in oily areas, and improving the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> As someone who is past &amp;#34;middle age&amp;#34; I am always looking for an intense moisturizing product that doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> tried other, more expensive American ones from Sephora because I didn&#x27;t want to wait on shipping and returned it and came back to this one.  </li>
            <li> the bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> At the end of a long day this oil blends with facial oil and loosens clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday as I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup, however, on the days I do, this cleansing oil is a must.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always a little concerned when trying new store bought cleansers.</li>
            <li> If I have the bad occasional breakout, it won&#x27;t help heal it but does seem to calm the redness right after I wash my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This struck me as a little odd as I have very very oily skin.</li>
            <li> I had dry, red bumpiness on my cheeks (and oily the zone.)  </li>
            <li> This cleanser really deep cleans and keeps my dry skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> so I like the fact that this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but actually helps rehydrate it.</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, I have notice my skin overall is smoother with fewer dry bumps/blemishes.  </li>
            <li> , I wish my face was less sensitive</li>
            <li> Also - I use a white towel to dry my face and there is never any leftover makeup residue.</li>
            <li> Then I wet my hands and go back over my face to emulsify the oil, and lastly just rinse.</li>
            <li> One will last you a long long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried DHC&#x27;S other cleansing oils, and I have to say they do not compare to the original deep cleansing oil, and I have tried MAC&#x27;s &amp; Lumene&#x27;s cleasing oils and they leave behind a residue unlike DHC.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it is olive-oil based, if it is left too long or used in excess it might dry skin a bit</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve usually not used this type of make up remover simply because I have contacts.</li>
            <li> It gently takes off makeup and any other face products you may use, i.e. scar cover or heavy eye makeup.</li>
            <li> you suffered breakouts from this product, next time try to use less force when massaging it on your face, and only do it for a short amount of time!</li>
            <li> Did not even open the product until the end of May 2012 because I still had a lot left from my other bottles.</li>
            <li> in that it smells a little old</li>
            <li> It is the only oil cleanser that you apply with dry fingers to a dry face.</li>
            <li> Looks like one doesn&#x27;t need harsh drying cleansers in order to have clear skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let this oil stay on your face too long.</li>
            <li> It removes the toughest water proof makeups that I wear all day long.</li>
            <li> I have used this product from DHC for a long time .  </li>
            <li> Then, I fill water into my fogless shower before getting my hands wet and working it prior to washing it off.</li>
            <li> I was a long time user of DHC cleansing oil whilst living in Japan.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long way</li>
            <li> I use it to remove my make up (eye makeup too) or to just wash my face at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> The bottle is much smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I will buy again, but don&#x27;t foresee needing to for a long time because it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about it for a long time</li>
            <li> It removes make up, even mascara and eyeliner, leaves the skin feeling like skin and works miracles on minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> 2-3 mins of rubbing/massaging is too long, it&#x27;s almost guaranteed that you will breakout no matter what you do.</li>
            <li> I pair it with an all natural exfoliation wash to help remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> And the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve used makeup wipes for so long.</li>
            <li> I broke out with pimples from this product even after rinsing it entirely off after application with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li> I suffered from acne for a long time.</li>
            <li> Pores have been cleared out (although I notice it doesn&#x27;t work for blackheads on the nose, but it does draw it out just enough that the nose feels rough, like it&#x27;s trying to come out but not completely).</li>
            <li> Not sure the reason why when this 4th bottle came, the color of the oil was yellow-greenish, not like the pure yellow I saw in previous bottles.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only down about a fourth of a bottle in</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise I intend to keep buying this product as long as they keep making it which I hope will be for a long long time!</li>
            <li> Hate to spend more money to get a new bottle.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t, but it also didn&#x27;t break me out like a 14 year old girl which I half expected.  </li>
            <li> I typically follow up with a general face wash like Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s affordable especially compared to other high-end cleansing oils.</li>
            <li> It also really seems to help control my oily skin without leaving me with that dried out tight feeling.  </li>
            <li> price is not very high.</li>
            <li> I thought it was from some other facial products that I use.</li>
            <li> No matter what other products I have tried, I have been coming back to this oil for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other cleansing oils and they are nothing compared to DHC Deep Cleansing Oil.</li>
            <li> My other acne cleared up though, so I have mixed feelings about this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Upon further inspection and reading raves reviews here and on other beauty forums, I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ve tried everything else, so why not?</li>
            <li> and then I went back to my other face</li>
            <li> I tried one from WholeFoods (Herbessence Makeup Remover from Aubrey Organics - about $10), and one other from Sephora (Philosophy&#x27;s Release me eye makeup ~ $20) - with a mixed bag of results.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other cleansing product.  </li>
            <li> Originally I wanted something to help take off makeup that wouldn&#x27;t strip my face and didn&#x27;t have a bunch of weird chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Definitely give this a chance and think about the other two products.</li>
            <li> I tried several other products, but it dawned on me</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re sort-of supposed to use a different cleanser after this to counterbalance the extreme oiliness.  </li>
            <li> and I still have a little, Using it only at night you can make it last around 4 or 5 months,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about heavy makeup , since I only use bb cream and it works really well to remove that.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li> I rub this into my DRY skin in circular motions for about 30 seconds after I use eye makeup remover, then rinse.  </li>
            <li> Just squirt a pump or two into your dry hands.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin.</li>
            <li> However, it really does leave my 40-year-old skin with a subtle glow.  </li>
            <li> The thinner the oil, the faster you can spread it over your dry face.</li>
            <li> You use it on a dry face, and then wash it off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior citizen now and my skin tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> AND MY FACE DOESN&#x27;T LOOK AND FEEL DRY IN THE MORNING.</li>
            <li> My face can get a tad dry in winter, so I&#x27;ll look forward to seeing this product perform.</li>
            <li> If you have dry sky</li>
            <li> It is dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I kinda like massaging it into my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to any body who has a dry but oily complexion.</li>
            <li> Anyhoo, as described you rub on dry skin with dry hands and then rinse off.  </li>
            <li> As an added measure I dry face with a dry facecloth for needed exfoliation spots.  </li>
            <li> The directions say to apply with dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Use 1-2 pumps in dry hands.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s so dry here in the california desert area...</li>
            <li> Spread on Dry face over makeup and massage in (gets rid of all blackheads &amp; whiteheads).</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I dispense one squirt of this onto dry hands and apply to my dry face.  </li>
            <li> In the winter my skin gets dry and flaky and the oil in a one-time use cleared up that problem.</li>
            <li> I let my face dry</li>
            <li> well - you put it on dry to your face and work it in and then wash it off.</li>
            <li> My skin feels balanced and doesn&#x27;t go from oily before washing to dry after washing.</li>
            <li> After she used this her skin is no longer dry</li>
            <li> I used to think one shouldn&#x27;t clean their face with oil, but I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> Rub your hands together, rub the oil on your dry face.</li>
            <li> You have to remember to apply to a dry face.</li>
            <li> have combination skin - oily with dry patches.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling stripped dry like shiseido does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I use it My face is dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that you put in on dry skin and then rinse it off with water.</li>
            <li> You have to remember to pump this into the palm of your hands, rub palms together, and massage into DRY face.</li>
            <li> It goes on dry, loosens and removes makeup</li>
            <li> I put the oil onto my dry hands and face and concentrate on massaging my cheek bones and jawline in an upward motion.  </li>
            <li> Cleans well, and does not leave your skin feeling dry, and drawn.</li>
            <li> Just follow the directions -- massage in with dry hands on a dry face.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product works so well and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and can not live without it.</li>
            <li> It removes every single drop of makeup.</li>
            <li> The first week of using the oil, my pimples stayed on my face and did not get worse.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed my skin is less sensitive and less oily in the T-zone.  </li>
            <li> , it will not make your oily skin oilier, it will break down the extra oil on your skins surface, though.</li>
            <li> It did leave my eye lashes a little ouly; however not as much as I&#x27;ve seen in the past without the products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed Health magazine would highly recommend this product with it being tried and true.</li>
            <li> You have to use it dry w/DRY hands!  </li>
            <li> I use less moisturizer overall.</li>
            <li> You put this product on dry not with a wet face.</li>
            <li> With the DHC you need a minuscule amount on wet skin and it cleans without leaving your skin oily or too dry.</li>
            <li> If you try to use this on a wet face it won&#x27;t work, it has to go on dry.</li>
            <li> The product I had been using would leave a slight residue on my face which is why I felt it necessary to wash after.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about this face wash.  </li>
            <li> You can use this everyday and it will not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil is a little expensive for me, but the first bottle I bought lasted nearly a year.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this product on bare-no makeup skin just because personally it made my skin a little bit dry that way.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN, AND I USE A CLARISONIC MIA WITH A CREAM CLEANSER.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that is prone to breakout and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an oil based cleanser because my face can get very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, but it appears oily on the surface.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Although, the product did remove every trace of makeup I found that every night after I used this, my skin felt very dry and dehydrated.</li>
            <li> My face has also broken out but at first thought it may have been other reasons.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery about the authenticity of the product because a lot of people say to buy face,body and hair products from the actual distributor,store or beauty salon or supply store.  </li>
            <li> my skin was cleaner and the little bumps and such were going.</li>
            <li> For eye-make up cleaning, you just SIMPLY CLOSE YOUR EYES, PUMP ONE DROP and RUB ON YOUR EYES for a little while</li>
            <li> The oiliness takes a little getting used to, but it works so well for daily use.</li>
            <li> A little pricy, but it should last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> and then I step into the shower and when the water hits my face, I just kinda rub a few small circles over my face and it rinses completely clean and there is not a trace of waterproof eyeliner or mascara left behind.</li>
            <li> However when I use the product after I took my contacts out at night it definitely removed all of the make up especially on my eyes including shadow and mascara which I have often found to be really hard for me to do.</li>
            <li> Also, a poor review I read was clearly for a tampered product (it sounded like regular olive oil was sent?!?)</li>
            <li> This stuff really cleans all all your makeup without a trace and no raccoon eyes left behind from your eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> At the rate I&#x27;m using it, I&#x27;m also not sure how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> This size should last at least 6 months with daily use.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend if you&#x27;ve had trouble removing eye makeup even with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser a few years back</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t wet your hands or face before using this.  </li>
            <li> I occasionally will use St. Ives Apricot Scrub every few days to exfoliate and I have been moisturizing with Cetaphil&#x27;s moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve usually disliked facial cleansers and makeup removers because they feel so drying that even lotion can&#x27;t replenish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every night now for a few weeks, and actually look forward to putting it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;d probably buy this again, and since I&#x27;m not very faithful to my skin care cleansers that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t wet your hands or face before using this.</li>
            <li> I will order again from this seller when my bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I only use this in the evening to wash away the heavy duty stuff: make-up, mascara and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> i then will wet my hands and continue to massage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and haven&#x27;t even used a fourth of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Although it may seem a bit expensive, definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> A thin layer of oil on your hands will heat up with your fingers and really bring blackheads to the surface &amp; get rid of every trace of makeup-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for only 3 days and it has completely dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> This size bottle will last you a few months if you use it once to twice a day.</li>
            <li> But not really.  </li>
            <li> My skin has become very dry in the last year and other products were causing my face a lot of trouble.</li>
            <li> Other facial cleansers made my skin feel so dry that I always was anxious to immediately apply moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I use one and a half pump on my dry face... and</li>
            <li> Always use it on a dry face, I like about half a pump.</li>
            <li> Also, totally useless if your skin is wet first.</li>
            <li> but, as long as they work the same at least to remove make up well.</li>
            <li> DHC deep cleansing oil IS designed to remove makeup, it has the ingredients to break down foundation &amp; greasy heavy concealers.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It lasts me up to 4 months, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Your skin will not feel tight or dry after using it.</li>
            <li> skin never feels tight or dry when using these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product and have been ordering from the same vendor the past two years now.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other cleanser.</li>
            <li> I keep a big pump bottle at home and carry the small travel bottle in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> After using it to remove makeup, my cheeks (where i break out usually) turn really red.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, about smearing what is basically fancy olive oil all over my face as a cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Not so with other oil based makeup removers.</li>
            <li> I will order this product again and again and can&#x27;t imagine using any other product to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> Only takes a small amount...oil spreads with water.</li>
            <li> I usually just use this at night and find it sufficient, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> I have not had a pimple since other than the occassional monthly hormonal one that is not caused by clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> and it does not irritate my eyes as some other products do.</li>
            <li> Unctuous, white flakes, insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol, to obtain a firmer product at ordinary temperatures.  </li>
            <li> I plan to try other DHC products as well.</li>
            <li> Other steps that have been helping are using the Shiseido whipped cleanser before this one, using Mario Badescu with one of those battery powered face scrubbers in the shower, and the Body Shops Vitamin E day</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 8 years now and had tried other brands.</li>
            <li> Like other have mentioned I believe this product is faulty or tampered with.</li>
            <li> I was not interested in trying cleansing oils until I received a sample of this DHC version.</li>
            <li> Takes makeup off extremely well.</li>
            <li> And while it may seem a little pricey, it only takes a small amount so a bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> My very dry skin is a little less dry too.  </li>
            <li> Just one little squirt rubbed over your dry face will remove all traces of make-up including mascara</li>
            <li> Note: apply with DRY hands to DRY skin, then rinse off and was face as usual.</li>
            <li> I use a cotton round for a little extra friction.</li>
            <li> But only thing is the oil will stick in your eyes for a little, will gone after few mins.</li>
            <li> have dry skin in my 40s so cannot use harsh cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skin type: Dry, with breakouts caused by dead skin/hormones</li>
            <li> This is a thick, emollient oil that doesn&#x27;t leave behind a messy residue and rinses clean with water.</li>
            <li> There are a few things I can not live without, and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li> Alas after only a few days I started to get a blemishes when I normally do not, the only change I had made was the use of this DHC.</li>
            <li> so it makes it a little harder to massage the skin.</li>
            <li> Only downside is it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> Poor thing, he just couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that it was so wrong to rub what looks and feels like [a more watered down] olive oil on your face!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the &amp;#34;foggy blinding&amp;#34; effect it has on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Using DHC cleansing oil turns what was once an uncomfortable nightly chore, removing my makeup, into a luxurious and relaxing way to get ready for bed.</li>
            <li> This product was NOT worth the $26 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I also think the price point is average for a product of this type.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price to buy DHC.</li>
            <li> IT HAS SOME DARK RESIDUE OF SOME SORT....</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that occasionally breaks out even though I&#x27;m in my late twenties</li>
            <li> The one thing I do love about this product is there isn&#x27;t any crap chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> In an attempt to copy the product, in the past I actually tried to use plain olive oil to wash my face.</li>
            <li> Breaks down even the hardest makeup like eyeliners and mascara.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been up and down with acne from oil.</li>
            <li> but the swelling has gone down.</li>
            <li> I would also have to soak cotton pads and leave them over my eyes for about 15-20 seconds before attempting to remove my eye makeup so that it could break down my mascara...</li>
            <li> /&gt;First you massage onto DRY skin &amp; wait for a few seconds then rinse with water &amp; voila!</li>
            <li> I bought this on impulse after reading a little online about oil cleaning, and it has completely changed the game for me.</li>
            <li> After rinsing this oil away I was shocked at how clean my skin was.</li>
            <li> I have less breakouts,</li>
            <li> My skin type is combination and slightly acne prone, but anyone can use this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> Also my skin has been breaking out less which allows me to wear less makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Tatcha cleansing oil for about a year and thought I would give the DHC cleansing oil a try because it is half the price.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> and I have less lines.  </li>
            <li> Many a times have I used those remedies instead of an expensive product, but sadly for this I did have to plonk the moolah for the quality.</li>
            <li> and I have slight rosacea on my cheeks</li>
            <li> I use less moisturizer because of this product.</li>
            <li> but this one works just as well and is one half the price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this problem with my previous bottles though.</li>
            <li> and that is a lot less money.....</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and slightly acne prone and use drug store make up.</li>
            <li> It was the worst, most concentrated around my chin and upper lip, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was the worst, most concentrated around my chin and upper lip, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It even has helped minimize the amount of blackheads and ingrowns that I previously had/would have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Korean and my Korean relatives have been using oil cleansers for years since they believe that makeup remover cloths are too abrasive.  </li>
            <li> changed(?)-- no longer opaque, slightly translucent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, although expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward at first; like not wetting your toothbrush before brushing your teeth would be sorta odd.  </li>
            <li> Then on wet face rub additional small amount of oil to create lather and wash off.  </li>
            <li> I uses the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer as base and I tried different kinds of removers, they can never remove everything clearly.</li>
            <li> routine now consists of splashing hot water on my face a few times, then cold, hot, cold, hot and end with cold (sort of like contrast shower).</li>
            <li> This cleanser gets all my makeup off my face without making my skin feel tight.  </li>
            <li> I was finally put on acutane my senior year in high school to combat the really bad acne.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup, foundation, heavy black eyeliner, and this baby removes everything....</li>
            <li> It did not clean my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a few weeks and deeper lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> If you pat a bit of water on your face you can work the oil into a little bit of lather before you rinse or wipe it off.</li>
            <li> work for a little while.</li>
            <li> This was a little bit on the pricey side</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful for the little samples that came in mail which is how I came to know about it.</li>
            <li> but it looks like little oil.</li>
            <li> Since my skin leans toward the oily side I was a little worried.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I would also apply a little sunscreen to the areas of my faces that has age spots</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey (in my opinion)</li>
            <li> Maybe a little bit like olive oil...?  </li>
            <li> My skin is moisturized, healthier looking, and the little massage each night has improved the appearance of the skin around my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have about 2/3 of the bottle left, and maybe if I learn something new about why I broke out so badly</li>
            <li> I have about 2/3 of the bottle left, and maybe if I learn something new about why I broke out so badly</li>
            <li> My skin became dry after using it and more terribly, some pimples came out from my face, which has never happened to me before.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with slight to moderate hormonal acne, but had never experienced a breakout quite like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a pity its so expensive outside Japan</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Anywho,  I am a firm believer in this product and the results speak volume.</li>
            <li> My husband is complementing me on my face everyday.</li>
            <li> rub oil on face and let it soak in a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> so alas I have to send this back.</li>
            <li> and I think the idea behind this cleanser is next to GENIUS!</li>
            <li> I have never experienced any oily sticky residue left on my face after rinsing off with water.</li>
            <li> I had tried a sample of DHC Cleansing Oil a few years ago, but didn&#x27;t care for it, probably because I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and spend a few minutes massaging it into my face morning and evening.</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t so buried in my skin after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use heavy eye makeup, but I do use a bit of DHC liquid eyeliner, DHC mascara &amp; DHC moisture care powder plus DHC lipstick.</li>
            <li> with in a few days I was blown away.</li>
            <li> A couple times a week I put a few drops in my palm and add a pinch of table salt for exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> (even heavy duty MAC LiquidLast eyeliner comes off), basically all make-up, but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dried out.</li>
            <li> My skin, which is wildly sensitive and ridiculously thin, loves it!  </li>
            <li> I noticed that it dried me out a bit.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like the heavy residue after applying it.</li>
            <li> I have used the Deep Cleansing Oil for approximately one week and noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin, and well as improvement with blemishes.  </li>
            <li> but I appreciate how well it works and how few ingredients are in it.</li>
            <li> but this is helpful because harsh cleansers also cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> (I wear a LOT of makeup), which is something that my harsh chemical makeup removers never did.  </li>
            <li> I am buying a few bottles for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> and I always have it on hand, but I don&#x27;t use it as my everyday cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I wear foundation everyday and wouldn&#x27;t be without this.</li>
            <li> I put on makeup everyday and this oil melts everything off even the waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and Im in awe</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late forties and have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> I mean everything from tiny bumps to huge cystic acne under the skins surface that is both painful and impossible to get rid of with any topical product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way making this less costly than a lot of less expensive cleansers.</li>
            <li> The solubility of the former(Right) is clearly very poor (it&#x27;s not miscible with water at all in fact) compared to the other (Left).  </li>
            <li> I started wearing waterproof mascara and removing it was always a mess!</li>
            <li> I think Josie Maran has a similar product, but this one is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I hate to wash my face too much because I feel like it gets too dry.</li>
            <li> , I hadn&#x27;t broken out in a single pimple for years...until using this) because it wasn&#x27;t designed to remove makeup and the idea of using another cleanser to remove makeup sounded to harsh.</li>
            <li> You just apply a few squirts and massage it into your scalp, then shampoo as usual.</li>
            <li> Fought it for years with assorted acne products, about 5 years ago an aesthetician friend got me off the acids/acne stuff, convinced me that part of my problem was that those products are designed for teens (I&#x27;m now 40) and are too harsh for adult skin, it was just irritating it and making the problem worse.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice in the past few months.</li>
            <li> I can even tell when I&#x27;ve gotten lazy and not used it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Water starts breaking down the product, and it loses its effect.</li>
            <li> I live in northern cold weather climate.  </li>
            <li> I have heard it&#x27;s not great for people with dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to having a little leftover mascara smudging beneath my lower lashes, but there was nothing!</li>
            <li> We all deserve a little pampering!  </li>
            <li> I was having a problem with breakouts and was afraid of using an oil product but this foams up and leaves my face soft with no breakouts!</li>
            <li> It is expensive but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It has an oil base but is not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling and removes all my makeup; after cleansing my skins does not feel as taut and dry as with other regular cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Wash with your usual product after to remove oily residue.</li>
            <li> Up to this point, I used coconut oil as a make-up remover (just ordinary coconut oil, pulled some out of the kitchen in a jar to keep in the bathroom).  </li>
            <li> I have never used this without makeup, so I am not sure how well this holds up without makeup.</li>
            <li> Uhm maybe, it is softer, but I am not sure for the amount of money it costs</li>
            <li> I know it seems scary to rub oil on your face--it goes against female engrained teenaged acne OCD training--but trust.</li>
            <li> I can usually then rinse it all off, but sometimes I&#x27;ll use a cotton pad to help remove the eye</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I actually stopped getting random zits while using this.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s from this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not authentic.</li>
            <li> And getting mascara off my eyes is a breeze now - no more harsh wiping, tugging, and pulling around that delicate skin.</li>
            <li> your still not sure if this is for you...</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a deep cleansing product that is not drying.  </li>
            <li> IMHO, there&#x27;s no better cleanser for my fave.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m feeling lazy, I do 2 pumps in one wash</li>
            <li> Rinse and follow with your usual liquid or bar cleanser (I use DHC olive soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This would definitelly work for those who use excessive amounts of makeup though.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li> I did get some small breakouts after using it twice</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it was the cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I use it year round and nothing else!  </li>
            <li> so I usually end up decanting some into travel-sized plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s breaking me out or not.</li>
            <li> as anything you just rubbed into your eyes would do :/</li>
            <li> and it comes with some few sample products!</li>
            <li> not sure what it is</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure about its ingredients and am wondering if it might contain some thing that I may not want to put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t pay almost $30/mo.</li>
            <li> and this is so much less cumbersome and efficient to get on and off your face!!  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the dry areas anymore, and pretty much soared through a horrible, frigid and dry winter without that skin showing the stress.</li>
            <li> apply on my dry dirty face massaging it into my skin from the forehead down to my neck.</li>
            <li> It is as thick and slick as olive oil.</li>
            <li> i prefer to use this during the cold months because this will not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Sadly, made my skin break out in new and unfortunate ways.</li>
            <li> Hard to find products anywhere at any price that match the quality &amp; necessity of these items.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> Did not wash makeup off and was hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> I hardly need that at my age.  </li>
            <li> They expect greasy and hard to rinse off but once they try it, they are hooked as well.    </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t it be hard to wash off all that oil from the face?&lt;br /&gt;NOPE</li>
            <li> I also wear tubing mascara and all-day shadow which can be hard to remove.</li>
            <li> acne prone; hardly use makeup;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was too late when my face was breaking out again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend organic, cold pressed, extra virgin olive oil.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not waterproof) and I feel like I have to rub my eyes a bit which I don&#x27;t like because it feels scratchy and tugs at my delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li> Try it at least once, you&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> No pulling on your delicate eye area, no wiping over and over to get rid of the raccoon in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I have been struggling to find products to help with my delicate aging skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M GOING TO START AN INVESTIGATION ABOUT THIS SELLER AND FILE A COMPLAINT AND PERSUE</li>
            <li> It works every time, even on thick mascara.</li>
            <li> I can now say that after using this product for a week my blackheads are slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> this formula is too thick</li>
            <li> , I am someone who wears quite a thick amount of foundation and trust me when I say that this truly removes about 95-100% of it.</li>
            <li> And I do mean all.  </li>
            <li> This cleaner works well if you use a very small amount, as it is an oil.  </li>
            <li> You would think oil would be terrible for oily or acneic skin types, but it&#x27;s actually the opposite.</li>
            <li> That is some serious skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Living a cold winter weather of the midwest this has been so helpful in keeping my still from being dry.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was less expensive...</li>
            <li> She used to use cold cream, same effect - much less labour and rubbing, which is not good for your skin - neither is the cold cream..</li>
            <li> This also makes my eyes sting a little bit, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> and this has not agitated or made it worse in the least.  </li>
            <li> There are no good imitators.</li>
            <li> The idea of &#x27;cleaning&#x27; my face with an oil seemed insane to me at first, but when you understand the concept of &#x27;like disolves like&#x27; (oil disolves oil in this case)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the samples were usually used for 3 days</li>
            <li> And I got multiple acne on my chin area from doing this :(</li>
            <li> I checked but did not see the expiration date, so not sure what went wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil didn&#x27;t break me out immediately, but after religious use for about 3 weeks, I broke out in a pimp on my cheek from it :(</li>
            <li> Takes off all my makeup including my very hard to get rid of stilla brown liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> stupid simple</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it and are skeptical or on the fence,just try it at least once.</li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t make it any worse.</li>
            <li> It takes off every bit of makeup and dirt including eye makeup, without irritating or drying the skin.</li>
            <li> Melts make-up and cleans without stripping my face or leaving an oily residue behind.</li>
            <li> After reading the negative reviews, I realize I got a fake.</li>
            <li> I have had horrible acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s secret number 1</li>
            <li> It works so well to take off makeup with out irritating skin.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any breakouts or clogged pores after using this product.</li>
            <li> , I have never experienced any break outs from this product</li>
            <li> It even gets annoying because I end up feeling like I&#x27;m exfoliating my face with those things (gross I know).</li>
            <li> This removes my stubborn eye makeup without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> Use this oil on dry hands and massage in to your skin all over your face and especially delicate around the eyes and eyelashes and voila!</li>
            <li> When I pumped some into my hands it felt a little sticky, but washing it off was almost impossible.  </li>
            <li> I hate a cleanser that after cleaning and when your skin is dry it feels like it could crack.</li>
            <li> ; if you do it too long it can make you break out!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed  </li>
            <li> i had a difficult time washing it off.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if I could find out if they do not engage in animal testing but have been unable to determine that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to all my friends and people are always skeptical when they hear it&#x27;s Cleansing OIL.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed...</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not that expensive, so I want to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> and I was really skeptical because I thought that oil would make my skin even oilier.</li>
            <li> it is expensive in terms of dollar per each ml.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really difficult to wash off.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> And counter it with the expensive eye creams that you will NOT be buying, aye?</li>
            <li> but my skin has this weird filmly feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> Weird idea</li>
            <li> I thought I made a wrong decision buying this product.</li>
            <li> otherwise I would probably break out even worse!</li>
            <li> So I thought maybe because its deep cleaning my pores so well, the grime and bacteria from my makeup brushes (foundation, powder, concealer, blush, blenders, eye brushes, brow brushes, etc.) were getting in and causing the horrific breakout.</li>
            <li> Just wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> this is fake stuff....don&#x27;t buy it...</li>
            <li> I, too, was skeptical about using oil to cleanse my breakout-prone skin, but not to worry.  </li>
            <li> The other was too runny and smelled nasty.</li>
            <li> all my friends steal some from me, even the ones that thought  I was crazy for slapping oil on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product about 15 years ago, but I stopped using it because it was inconvenient to order.</li>
            <li> Do not be afraid that it says OIL</li>
            <li> I have oily to combination skin, and I was afraid that this cleansing oil might result in breakouts</li>
            <li> Oily acne prone girls- do NOT be afraid to use this.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it by itself if I feel that my face didnt get too dirty</li>
            <li> I was afraid of oil in the sink but it truly is water soluable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid even if you have oily or problematic skin.</li>
            <li> Obsessed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!!</li>
            <li> After struggling with hormonal acne for 8 months I realized that drying out your skin makes your acne worst, and for me, acne medicine like retina, salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide only aggravated my acne and made it worst.</li>
            <li> These product made my face so dry and miserable that it made my acne worst, it didn&#x27;t get rid of the blackheads either.</li>
            <li> Too bad - I won&#x27;t repurchase this.  </li>
            <li> I thought an oil would be bad for blemishes</li>
            <li> People often think oil is bad.  </li>
            <li> The product that I received from this seller smells rancid, like olive oil that has gone bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad.  </li>
            <li> This is where a lot of people make a mistake and think the product is bad.  </li>
            <li> I started getting this really bad allergic reaction....</li>
            <li> /&gt;i dislike this&lt;br /&gt;it bad for me .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so frustrated because I thought I&#x27;d start growing out of it by now.</li>
            <li> It smell like Olive Oil &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> It might seem crazy to rub oil into oily skin but it works!</li>
            <li> Disappointed...</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> WTF?!?!</li>
            <li> Hate it when  I run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to wash off and leaves all my makeup on my face!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brutal winter this year</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t affect my eyes except to maybe moisturize them as well in frigid winter temps.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Give it a try and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Get terrible breakouts after using this.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> and yet I hated it!</li>
            <li> The worst thing is that it has brown precipitates inside the bottle.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got a sample in the mail and decided to order.  Love the product!</li>
            <li> I have been using the deep cleansing oil for a few months now and I am very happy with the results. I use it at night to remove make up. It leaves my skin feeling nice.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup remover &amp; face cleanser EVER! I just bought some in travel sizes for vacations this summer. I won&#x27;t go without it!</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to cleanser for over 10 years. I hear it&#x27;s a pre-cleanser and I should follow it with another cleanser, but I don&#x27;t.  I use an alcohol-free toner after instead.  Love how the DHC Cleansing oil leave my skin clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let this oil stay on your face too long.</li>
            <li> OMG! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT! FACE TRULY FEELS CLEAN AFTER APPLYING AND REMOVING! MUST SKIN FEELS SO SOFT AFT USING CLEANSER!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late forties and have extremely oily skin. I always used cleansers that left my skin more on the dry side - but not a good thing when skin starts showing the signs of age. Based on reviews I made my decision to purchase this product and am happy to say my search for the perfect cleanser is done. I wear foundation, lip products, and eye shadow w/mascara daily.  I use one pump and massage in onto my entire face in circular motions.  It comes off completely with water, effectively removing all traces of makeup, dirt &amp; oil.  Leaves my skin soft, clean, and calm. Love it!</li>
            <li> Been using for years, deep cleans and removes eye makeup without stinging.  Could never be without.  Many people believe that is you have oily skin you should not use oil to clean but it is quite the opposite!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product; will probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> So I have had a greasy, acne ridden face since middle school. I wish I had known about this stuff 15 years ago! It washes away makeup, dirt, and oil so well and it leaves my skin so soft and well prepped for a cleanser. I have heard it&#x27;s not great for people with dry skin but it works amazing for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Exposed the oil on my skin more so (my skin is already oily too!) and effectively made my acne worse. I&#x27;m disappointed Health magazine would highly recommend this product with it being tried and true.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t  get any better than this! Wonderful</li>
            <li> I m really happy with it. I only use it at night and I love the result. My skin feels fresh and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cleanser and leaves my face clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Great make up remover.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Wash with your usual product after to remove oily residue. I was having a problem with breakouts and was afraid of using an oil product but this foams up and leaves my face soft with no breakouts!</li>
            <li> Why I love this:&lt;br /&gt;-Amazing cleanser that hydrate &amp; take off all your make-up at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves your skin really soft afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to look out for:&lt;br /&gt;- You do have to rinse this off with another cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;- It smell like Olive Oil &#x3D;( (but hey what do you expect, it is oil!)</li>
            <li> Superb product for removing makeup and cleansing the face without stripping away natural oils. Great for women over 40 with papery dry skin or hormonal disorders like hypothyroidism. If this is you, get this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over five years now, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  I have really dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  It&#x27;s easy to use and takes off my makeup.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I am glad to know Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best for removing makeup without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of DHC Deep Cleansing Oil by mail.  Up to this point, I used coconut oil as a make-up remover (just ordinary coconut oil, pulled some out of the kitchen in a jar to keep in the bathroom).  From the sample received, I bought the product.  It did an excellent job removing make-up.  This product feels thicker than coconut oil.  Overall a very good product.  My only complaint is the &amp;#34;foggy blinding&amp;#34; effect it has on my eyes.  Although the directions state not to apply directly to eyes, I have to chuckle, because I need to get my mascara off, and in the process, the product enters my eye.  I flush appropriately.  I find it a slight annoyance, but do find this product removes water proof mascara better than any product I&#x27;ve used (and done so in a quick manner).  I still love my coconut oil and continue to use depending on my make-up routine.  I find this cleansing oil is great for the heavier make-up day!</li>
            <li> Have been using for years. don&#x27;t think I can give it up. You can notice the difference the first time &amp; others will compliment you on your complexion. DHC has some of the best products for beauty. The Olive Oil moisturizer , the Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, the facial masks, Velvet Skin Coat. Hard to find products anywhere at any price that match the quality &amp; necessity of these items.&lt;br /&gt;Your face will thank you for using this .</li>
            <li> I have been using this off and on for about 10 years. It does a wonderful job of breaking down and removing makeup and dirt without stripping your skins natural oils. Nothing removes eye-makeup better and it rinses clean off. Some people use a toner after, but I never have and I never break out with the deep cleansing oil.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also good as an occasional head oil, when you have product or oil build up. You just apply a few squirts and massage it into your scalp, then shampoo as usual.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best makeup remover I have ever used. I will use this product forever!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years along with Mild Soap for makeup removal. Highly recommended, although expensive. Will continue purchasing.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would clean my face with oil but I love love love DHC Deep Cleansing Oil. It does the job on waterproof make-up and leaves your skin feeling soft.  I will never use anything else.  I am buying it for my sister, mom, friends. You will not be disappointed - treat yourself to something nice!</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that removes even stubborn mascara and makeup.  I rub this into my DRY skin in circular motions for about 30 seconds after I use eye makeup remover, then rinse.  I follow it with an olive oil bar soap.  I never have any foundation left on my face, and I don&#x27;t make raccoon eyes during the night from mascara that didn&#x27;t come off.  I have acne-prone skin, and this does not cause breakouts.  It also leaves my face feeling clean, but not squeaky and tight.  I definitely recommend if you&#x27;ve had trouble removing eye makeup even with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Great item, very smooth, good for use it in cold, dry winter.&lt;br /&gt;It is my first cleansing oil, very happy I had give it try, will order it again.</li>
            <li> I lOve DHC Deep cleansing oil. It totally removes all of my eye make-up and mascara. I swear by this product. I have been using it for over 7 years!!! Amazing stuff!! I normally order directly from DHC because you get a loyalty customer discount and it helps.  But since the shipping was free here,i had to have it. I was a little leery about the authenticity of the product because a lot of people say to buy face,body and hair products from the actual distributor,store or beauty salon or supply store.  This is the first time i have ordered from Amazon,so i have yet to see if the consistency is different or not. Anywho,  I am a firm believer in this product and the results speak volume. If you haven&#x27;t tried it and are skeptical or on the fence,just try it at least once. I know many people believe because it&#x27;s oil it will cause acne,quite the contrary. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This really cleans and feels wonderful after rinsing off and applying night cream.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how wonderfully well this removes make up!! Going on my second year of use and hope never to run out!!</li>
            <li> Obsessed! I cannot live with out this product! I have to use it every night it&#x27;s very important to have a gently cleanser to use after.</li>
            <li> Literally the best oil cleanser used. The touch of water after using it on face is magical. I also use Olive soup by DHC for couple cleansing.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleansing oil I&#x27;ve ever used. Everytime I use it I feel like I&#x27;m giving myself a treatment. The main ingredient is olive oil and I love the cleansing and moisturizing power of the oil. It removes all my makeup, even mascara. For waterproof mascara though, you&#x27;ll have to scrub a lot more. It rinses clean off and afterwards my face is a bit tight, but not dry. My favourite part of using this is when I apply it on my face I can really feel the bits of dirt and flakes scrub away when I massage it around my face, it opens up the dirt in the pores and my face feels much smoother afterwards. I have acne but this doesn&#x27;t make it any worse.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and it is just what I needed for my dry winter skin in Michigan. Love it. I don&#x27;t need lotion immediately after washing my face now. Yay!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for cleaning your face and taking makeup off Love it</li>
            <li> Adds a deep cleaning to your facial regime I use it twice a day every day. Works as well as it is advertised to.</li>
            <li> This takes off liquid eyeliner, mascara, foundation, everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil will remove all your makeup and dirt, but it did not get rid of my blackheads or whiteheads. This is a great cleanser. It is soo good all my friends steal some from me, even the ones that thought  I was crazy for slapping oil on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it&#x27;s been wonderful.  The last bottle I purchased was unusable.  Almost like it was just regular olive oil you would cook with.  Did not wash makeup off and was hard to get off.  Too bad - I won&#x27;t repurchase this.  Anyone know of a similar replacement?</li>
            <li> I guess its just not for me. Get terrible breakouts after using this.</li>
            <li> I was at first taken aback by the oil consistency, but it works great! cleans efficiently and thoroughly. I have hormone acne that keeps popping up. This seems to do a good job of deep cleaning-hence the name.</li>
            <li> This was actually a really good product, just not by this seller (Olive Care). I bought this cleanser a few years back and I loved it. I can see my makeup getting picked up by the cleanser making it a translucent whitish color, and when i rinsed it off it was not at all oily and my face was left squeaky clean. This time however, the product was a lot more oily and I didn&#x27;t see it removing my makeup. i had a difficult time washing it off. I felt like i just used regular cooking oil. It didn&#x27;t mix at all with the water and i had to stand under the shower while furiously rubbing my face just to get most of it off. I had to follow after with a generous amount of regular face wash. And while I was applying toner I notice that there was still some residue make up on my face because my cotton swab was a light beige color from the foundation that the cleanser didn&#x27;t take out. I don&#x27;t know for sure if this is the maker or the seller&#x27;s fault but this oil cleanser does not work any more. the bottle I bought from this seller was nowhere as good as the one I bought before.</li>
            <li> Continue to order. Great at removing waterproof eye makeup! One product does it all</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser  especially if you have dry skin.  Makeup comes off and rinses very easily!</li>
            <li> This really takes off all my makeup! I don&#x27;t have those raccoon eyes after washing anymore (despite heavy eyeliner usage) because this stuff really melts it all away clean.  There is some sort of ruddy residue left afterwards that I still have to wash my face with a cleanser, so I believe this is mostly good only as a makeup remover. I have never used this without makeup, so I am not sure how well this holds up without makeup. It certainly does not make my face tight or stripped of oil, it just feels normal after usage.  My face has not became anymore radiant or glowing as some reviewers have stated.  It is expensive but a little goes a long way.  I will repurchase!</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the best make up remover/cleanser I have ever used.  Regardless of the type of make up (i.e. water proof), it does an amazing job of removing makeup efficiently and gently. Although it is listed as &amp;#34;deep cleansing&amp;#34; you do need to use a good facial soap after (though no scrubbing is needed). Also, a poor review I read was clearly for a tampered product (it sounded like regular olive oil was sent?!?), it should not feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: Do not wet your hands or face before, dry is the way. One pump of the product should do it. Gently rub over face and closed eyes. Rinse and then use a your regular face soap.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing oil. The best ever and very prompt delivery. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Not sure I got the right product. The color is greener than shown in the company website and all the text is in Chinese. It does work very well though.</li>
            <li> best gentle and nourishing cleanser: doesn&#x27;t have nasty mineral oil. When you first put it on your face it feels like oil (no smell) but once you add water it dissolves right away leaving to sticky oily residue - clean and supple skin only. very natural , no chemicals; my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> My most favourite cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> Best Oil Cleansing Ever!  You just need this product for cleansing.  We tried so many products before.  Happy to find this one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s a great cleanser and makeup remover - even waterproof eyeliner and mascara. I&#x27;ve also tried a couple of DHC&#x27;s other formulas - a mild version and the pore cleanser. They work OK too, but for me, this original formula works best. You apply it dry, just rub it all over your face, and it rinses clean. You do have to make sure you rub it good around the eyes to remove makeup, especially stubborn eyeliner, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it. Those with sensitive eyes or contact wearers may want to proceed with caution, but again, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with eye irritation.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this oil.  It was the first one I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried other, more expensive American ones from Sephora because I didn&#x27;t want to wait on shipping and returned it and came back to this one.  I also researched others now that oil is catching on in the States and I think you are paying more for the brand than quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removes makeup, washes off clean and face feels soft but not tight and overdried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin in my 40s so cannot use harsh cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had acne in my 20s and wish I knew about this back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product out of the whole line and would recommend this as a starter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great starter oil with hundreds of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Worth it.  I am over 50 and I can&#x27;t use the cleansers that are the market----they are just too drying.  I hardly need that at my age.  This gets you clean while leaving you smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin and sensitive eyes and this is the only cleansing oil I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t break me out and/or irritate my eyes. It is very gentle but removes makeup quickly. It might seem crazy to rub oil into oily skin but it works! This stuff rinses off clean and leaves skin feeling soft and hydrated but not oily or sticky. I&#x27;m using this as the first step in a double cleanse routine in the evening and I&#x27;m very happy with it. If you pat a bit of water on your face you can work the oil into a little bit of lather before you rinse or wipe it off. As a side note my skin is sensitive and I get headaches from overly scented products but have had no problems with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 now, think this helps maintain skin look.</li>
            <li> Extremely effective make up remover without being harsh on the skin.  I wish the bottle was more portable, though -- once you open it,  can&#x27;t really pack it.</li>
            <li> love it takes off makeup and cleanses in on step without drying</li>
            <li> great i always use this one when i was in china....... and here it is even cheap in china with the same qulity.... love it</li>
            <li> I just turned 40 and after one week my face is looking younger, brighter and more radiant.    I think when I heard oil I assumed greasy and it isn&#x27;t greasy by any means.  My skin is so soft that I almost don&#x27;t feel like I need to put lotion on afterwards (but I do because I know I need to). My husband is complementing me on my face everyday.</li>
            <li> it is my favorite deep cleaning oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived in two days through Prime. Product is exactly as described. I&#x27;ve used this product and have been ordering from the same vendor the past two years now. Breaks down even the hardest makeup like eyeliners and mascara.</li>
            <li> Feel good after cleaning</li>
            <li> At first I did not like this soap, now I love it.!!! Tip: rub oil on face and let it soak in a few seconds.  Wash off with warm wet cloth.  Then on wet face rub additional small amount of oil to create lather and wash off.  It has done wonders to improve my eczema - I have not had any break outs...very pleased with my purchase.  I use the oil soap in the morning and at night before going to bed.  I then apply a moisturizer.  I occasionally will use a toner before applying the moisturizer but toners tend to dry the skin and defeats the purpose of using a oil soap to maintain the natural oils in your skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I have been using this for a year and I love it! It balances my skin like no other facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. A little goes a long way so you should only need to buy 2 bottles per year. I have never stuck with any cleanser this long as most don&#x27;t work or only work for a little while.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin clean, no oily residue and even helps remove eye make up.  I would give it 5 stars if I could find out if they do not engage in animal testing but have been unable to determine that.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I was so glad to see this product available on Amazon. I have used it for several years but had to order it from the manufacturer which took more time to come in. I use it to remove my makeup every day and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.It doesn&#x27;t strip my skin like so many other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Deep Cleansing Oil for years and was so glad to see it available on Amazon now.  It is hands down the best cleanser that I have ever used.  Just one little squirt rubbed over your dry face will remove all traces of make-up including mascara but it washes away cleanly with warm water leaving no oily feeling behind.  I don&#x27;t know how it works but it does.  It leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh with no harsh chemicals or perfumes.    I&#x27;ve recommended this to all my friends and people are always skeptical when they hear it&#x27;s Cleansing OIL.  They expect greasy and hard to rinse off but once they try it, they are hooked as well.    If you suffer from allergies to perfumes, dyes or have sensitive skin, this is an ideal product.  Just give it a try and be prepared to be amazed.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it to remove my makeup. It removes your mascara but you may need extra. Leaves my skin soft and non greasy. Is it better than avocado oil? Uhm maybe, it is softer, but I am not sure for the amount of money it costs</li>
            <li> This is my 6 bottle. Best cleansing oil ever! This can easily remove all the make up including the water prove mascara!</li>
            <li> I was once in love with this cleansing oil. Yes. It removes the toughest water proof makeups that I wear all day long. This was a little bit on the pricey side but I was able to use it at least for 6 months til the bottle went empty, so I kept on buying it. The magic of this stuff is only a dime size of oil does the trick. After a while using this, I started to have clogged pores. I thought it was from some other facial products that I use. And then I heard if your skin is acne prone, you need to stay away from cleansing oil and use foam cleanser. It was too late when my face was breaking out again. My face has become better since I stopped using this and it took me months and months of living in agony  trying to restore my disasterous face. IF YOUR SKIN IS ACNE PRONE, STAY AWAY FROM CLEANSING OILS!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample in the mail some time ago and loved using the product.  My skin felt clean.  The last time I purchased this product, it didn&#x27;t leave the same clean feeling.  I use one pump of the oil, massage it in my face, and then rinse it off.  I follow up with one of their soaps and toners.  The next day my skin is breaking out!  I don&#x27;t know what happened with the product but it doesn&#x27;t feel the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to say, I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I use this to remove make up before following up with my regular facial cleanser. It takes about two passes to fully remove waterproof mascara but it takes off everything else in one go. (I don&#x27;t know how easily it removes heavy foundations as I don&#x27;t wear beyond sheer coverage/tinted moisturizer but given that it removes waterproof mascara it should be a problem). The only things I dislike is that the pump dispenses a bit too much at a time, and I find that I end up using up the product quite quickly. I will continue to purchase though!</li>
            <li> I works very good and I really like it! Every time I made up, it help me to remove the made up clearly and instantly. It also benefits my skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this after all the amazing reviews but was leery with the use of oil how it would make my skin react. I went for it anyways!! This works AMAZING!! It took off my makeup with almost no effort which is what I wanted, vs using the wipes where I have to rub my skin. Alas after only a few days I started to get a blemishes when I normally do not, the only change I had made was the use of this DHC. I have sensitive/dry skin at times so alas I have to send this back. To those on the fence I say try it, it works great and really wish my skin had reacted better. I guess it&#x27;s back to those wipes!!!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before, because although I care about my products I have never felt compelled to advocate for any. I bought this on impulse after reading a little online about oil cleaning, and it has completely changed the game for me. No more dry skin, or oily skin for that matter: just clean, pleasant, supple, completely happy skin. I know it seems scary to rub oil on your face--it goes against female engrained teenaged acne OCD training--but trust.</li>
            <li> Love DHC. So gentle but entirely effective, removes every last trace of make-up and leaves skin so soft and smooth. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil is a little expensive for me, but the first bottle I bought lasted nearly a year. I love it for cleaning off makeup, and with this alone my face is thoroughly clean...nothing else needed. I&#x27;m thankful for the little samples that came in mail which is how I came to know about it.</li>
            <li> This product has totally changed my nighttime routine. Using DHC cleansing oil turns what was once an uncomfortable nightly chore, removing my makeup, into a luxurious and relaxing way to get ready for bed. This cleanser removes all traces of makeup, even mascara with gentle massaging and water. That&#x27;s it! Just squirt a pump or two into your dry hands. Rub your hands together and gently massage onto your dry face. I then take my index fingers and rub horizontally over my lashes and eyes to really dissolve the mascara. Then I wet my hands and go back over my face to emulsify the oil, and lastly just rinse. All my makeup is gone and my skin feels great! It does not dry your skin and is really gentle on your eyes. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough to anyone looking for a gentle, yet unbelievably effective facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product right here on Amazon, after reading the rave reviews.  I received it today and was a bit baffled on how the rest of you knew how to use this product since my bottle came with the instructions inside the package written in Japanese.  The backside of the bottle where the ingredients is listed; is also in Japanese.  Did I get what I was supposed to, since I would have thought this oddity would have been mentioned in the reviews.  I will update my review in a month or so after I have \\&quot;correctly\\&quot; used this product and am grateful the instructions are here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product from DHC for a long time .  It is a great product. It removes make-up like no other.  I was a little disappointed  in that it smells a little old but I&#x27;m using it any, it&#x27;s a good price.  Noma</li>
            <li> Highly recommend product and seller.</li>
            <li> clean the face totally and not dry</li>
            <li> I had dry, red bumpiness on my cheeks (and oily the zone.)  This helped even out my skin, I adore it!  My skin feels great, neither dry nor oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed...where has this product been all my life? First and only product I&#x27;ve ever used that has removed my make up completely. Leaves my face feeling clean and fresh with being overly dry. It&#x27;s unparalleled!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying oil cleaning and I love it! Leaves your skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best make up remover. It really works well on mascara. I use this prior to using a foamy soap</li>
            <li> I live in northern cold weather climate.  I need the moisture.  Deep cleansing provides the extra moisture with gentle cleansing.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time I spent the time to rate anything I have purchased online. This is because I think this cleanser is worth my time, and impressive.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily acne prone skin (quite oily).  I get acne due to clogged pores and skin-producing oil very easily. So I always stayed away from cosmetic products which contain any kind of oil.&lt;br /&gt;I am a person who takes good care of my skin with daily routines. I have used many kinds of facial cleansers and facial products from lower-priced drug store cleansers to expensive-department products, which are well liked by higher-end users, to a few Asian products. So that is some background information about me.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is amazing! One is supposed to put it on dry face to clean all the make-up/dirty residues off. Chemically speaking, LIKE WILL DISSOLVE LIKE.  So the oil will dissolve all that oily stubborn-to-remove products on your face and washes them off leaving skin CLEAN.  One&#x27;s skin will be clean and NOT a trace of oil left.&lt;br /&gt;This oil cleanser was created to react with water when comes in contact to become a milky liquid which washes completely off skin, leaving skin soft at the same time (Not over-drying). This product is very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I am a biologist with a chemistry background and I think the idea behind this cleanser is next to GENIUS! Thanks to creative and intelligent scientists!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I can buy DHC products on Amazon Prime - that is a HUGE boon.  As to the Deep Cleansing Oil itself, I like that it dissolves all of my make-up and is easy to use, but I (weirdly) find it a bit drying and need to moisturize and exfoliate more often than normal.  Because of this, I&#x27;ve started using it predominantly as eye make-up remover, which works well.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product about 15 years ago, but I stopped using it because it was inconvenient to order. Recently I began using Estée Lauder double wear make up, and realized that, while it lasts all day long (a good thing), it was also very difficult to remove completely at night. I remembered the DHC deep cleansing oil from years ago, and was delighted to find it on Amazon. Sure enough, it is as good as I remember! It dissolves every trace of makeup completely. I follow with Cereve Foaming Facial Cleanser to thoroughly clean my skin, then apply my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have very sensitive skin that breaks out and fluctuates between oily and dry and flaky.  I can only use the gentlest cleansers and sometimes even the ones that are marketed as gentle sting when I put them on my skin. Other gentle cleanser cannot remove all of my make-up, such as eye shadow and mascara. This oil feels wonderful on my skin and removes all of my make-up without stripping any natural moisture.  The oil will not make skin feel oily.  I have used other cleaning oils that have felt heavy, sticky, or even like the product was pulling on my skin as I  tried to smooth the oil over my face.  This product does not do any of those; it goes on smoothly and rinses clean.  No matter what other products I have tried, I have been coming back to this oil for years.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found in years.  Even caked on mascara comes off quickly and easily, leaving your face soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing cleansing product on the market.  I have used it for years........the purified Japanese oil gently and lightly suds and leaves no oily finish after rinsing.  Fabulous for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Cleans my skin and it does not irritate my skin at all! Great for dry skins like mine!</li>
            <li> I have used this for 5 years now.  It is pricey...but so worth it. You don&#x27;t wet your hands or face before using this.  Just message the oil into your skin it feels so great.  Than wash with water.  It is not oily and comes right off.  Removes makeup like nothing I have ever tried.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy afterwards.  It is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I had tried samples I received from DHC mailings and always meant to buy some.  Finally did and I use it every night.  I love it.  I only need 1 or two pumps and it rinses right off.  When I&#x27;m out, I will buy it again, for sure.</li>
            <li> I have never had a face wash that leaves your face so smooth and clean. It smells like olive oil and fills like oil but washes away great.</li>
            <li> Best cleansing oil for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have been buying it for  5 years direct from the company but ran out and needed it faster, thank goodness for prime! This cleanser melts off non-waterproof makeup, you won&#x27;t see traces of leftover foundation or mascara on your towel. It makes my night routine so much easier!  I think Josie Maran has a similar product, but this one is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I love DHC&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Oil. It&#x27;s suitable for most skin types as my skin is combination and my mom&#x27;s is normal-to-dry. We both use the cleansing oil to remove our make-up, and it does an excellent job. I first heard about this product through a friend, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One squirt is all it takes to remove all the dirt, oil and make-up. After rinsing, I follow up with a gentle face cleanser such as Cetaphil to thoroughly remove any leftover residue. One bottle lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s affordable especially compared to other high-end cleansing oils.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser! It takes off eye makeup, even waterproof, so quickly and easily! My skin feels so soft and smooth afterwards. I have somewhat oily skin but this does not leave an oily residue. It rinses completely off. I won&#x27;t use any other cleanser. My only surprise was that instead of a 6.7 fluid oz. bottle, I received 7-1oz. travel size bottles. I&#x27;m glad I still had my larger bottle to refill.</li>
            <li> I love this. My face has never been so clean and clear, and so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricy but worth it</li>
            <li> It cleans quite effectively, i used it as a make up remover, followed with a normal face wash afterward. Its quite pricey though, i now mix my own from jojoba oil, grape seed oil n olive oil, i think they even do a better job on my face!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now. It removes make up very very well, won&#x27;t dry skin like most other foaming like cleaners.</li>
            <li> Wow! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin. Wish it was more natural like the LAVO brand but it removed my eye makeup like nothing! 😃</li>
            <li> Easy to use and travel with seem to deep clean and goes on smoothly really try to use it every night</li>
            <li> Terrific product for all seasons, but especially winter time. Leaves skin silky smooth, not greasy.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash. I order this every 2 months. Always on time with prime shipping and removes all my makeup</li>
            <li> deep cleaning. love it</li>
            <li> It marvelous.  Skin feels so soft!!  Cleans great.</li>
            <li> great product! Great service! Great speed! I would absolutely come back again!</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used....removes all traces of makeup and leaves my skin silky soft. I&#x27;m happy to see it available on Amazon. Check both Amazon and DHC site for the best buy. Right now its on sale until 3/31/11 at DHC for $21.00 for a 6.7 ounce bottle. I bought 2 bottles and shipping was $4.50. Had I opted to spend twice as much on DHC products (easy to do)shipping would have been free. Every time you make a purchase at DHC, you can select 4 free samples from an extensive list of choices. I always select samples of the Deep Cleansing Oil which I stash in my cosmetic bag in a suitcase. It&#x27;s more convenient than pouring into a smaller bottle for travel. DHC does carry a small travel size pump bottle, but I find it&#x27;s more convenient to just carry the sample size packets on short business trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/24/15 update -  I continue to use this product faithfully....and the best recommendation I can give is that people are surprised to learn my age. 64 y.o. with soft skin and no wrinkles...good genes, for sure, but this fine product contributes as well.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product, however, this particular bottle I received recently has oil of which consistency, texture, color and smell are very different from my previously purchased ones.  I have never experienced any oily sticky residue left on my face after rinsing off with water. But this one sticks. I need to use soap for sure to remove the oiliness. I almost feel as though the product has been adulterated with regular olive oil. Plus, the color is more green than light green/yellow, which makes me think even more that it may have been tampered/compromised ....not satisfied at all.&lt;br /&gt;＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿&lt;br /&gt;Olive Care kindly sent me a complementary bottle of DHC cleansing oil, but this one also is defective.  I tested this new bottle of oil against the other bottle that I purchased from an authorized seller,SkinCareRx (by DHC, officially).  The solubility of the former(Right) is clearly very poor (it&#x27;s not miscible with water at all in fact) compared to the other (Left).  Some others seem to have experienced the same thing as me, and I am pretty sure they got the same lot, which I think is &amp;#34;FFMTS(on the back of the box.)&amp;#34;  If this lot is defective, I guess it&#x27;s DHC&#x27;s fault, but since Olive Care is not officially authorized by DHC to sell their products, DHC would not be able to do anything about our purchases through Olive Care.</li>
            <li> I purchased this using a coupon that I bought from one of those daily email sites and have been very impressed. It is winter/dry and I use this every AM. I have combination skin and am in my early 30s. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts yet I also don&#x27;t feel like my skin/pores appear any better off since I started this product. I especially like using it before a shave. I rub on one pump, which covers my face and neck. Then, I fill water into my fogless shower before getting my hands wet and working it prior to washing it off. I&#x27;m going to try one of the different cleansing oils (less costly) and maybe even attempt to make one on my own (2 parts castor, 1 part EVOO, teaspoon of essential oils such as tea tree, eucalyptus, sweet orange) but I would definitely recommend oil as cleansing for a man!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its fast, its easy and my skin likes it. I don&#x27;t ever plan to run out of it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I got in in a swag bag years ago and it works wonders leaving my face clean without stripping away the moisture.  Glad I remembered the name and was able to get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I only use it at night to remove my makeup. After rinsing, it&#x27;s important to wash with regular facial soap. My face feels clean and my pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li> Always trust Japanese based company product! It works gently including washing off mascara! Price was a bit pricey so four star.</li>
            <li> I was a long time user of DHC cleansing oil whilst living in Japan. The idea of &#x27;cleaning&#x27; my face with an oil seemed insane to me at first, but when you understand the concept of &#x27;like disolves like&#x27; (oil disolves oil in this case) then its much easier to use. Just apply a small quantity onto dry face, massage around (especially good for eye makeup removal) then rinse off in shower or with a washcloth and warm water. It rinses off cleanly leaving no residue without the need for scrubbing and rubbing. Just a pity its so expensive outside Japan, I think the large bottle was less than $15 there.</li>
            <li> DHC cleansing oil is the best facial cleaner I have ever tried.  It leaves my face moist, but not oily</li>
            <li> Great delivery time and good quality</li>
            <li> Great Product! It does not dry out my face. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Great facial wash. I had this as a sample at first and then got full-size bottle. I absolutely love it. Leaves my skin completely clean and clear.</li>
            <li> My skin no longer has oily and dry days, it&#x27;s all very normal. I use less moisturizer overall. I don&#x27;t look shiny. I think my skin is softer but I can&#x27;t really tell. I have less breakouts, well none really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one pump a day before I step in the shower then rinse it off in the shower. Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! I love it! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  I have oily skin, so I was leery but I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  This cleansing oil completely removes makeup the way no other product I have tried has.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Removes ALL makeup easily and leaves skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil is the best. One pump in your palm, spread over your face, and all makeup comes off. I work it in, especially around my eyes, and then clean it off with a warm, wet washcloth. It works every time, even on thick mascara. If only everything worked as well as this product!</li>
            <li> This product was NOT worth the $26 I paid for it. I used it 3x to try to get my eye makeup off &amp; it still didn&#x27;t get it all off! Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin that is prone to breakouts with most products I try. I have been using the DHC oil for years and years and it has never broken me out, clogged my pores, or dried my skin more. I use it to remove my makeup and follow up with Purpose cleanser, finishing with kukui nut oil to moisturize. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Definitely a star product. Very easy to use. Did everything I wanted without drying my skin. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had tried a sample of DHC Cleansing Oil a few years ago, but didn&#x27;t care for it, probably because I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly.  Recently, though, I&#x27;d been looking for something to remove makeup since my regular cleanser was leaving some foundation on my skin, and the glowing reviews for this (pun intended) encouraged me to try it.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the best way to use this for my skin is first to pump one long pump into my palms, rub my hands together to spread the oil and warm it up, and then apply to my dry face.  I massage it in circles to remove all my face makeup. Then I use a half-pump on my pointer fingers, and gently place them on my eyes; I let the oil sink in to remove stubborn mascara and eye makeup.  I can usually then rinse it all off, but sometimes I&#x27;ll use a cotton pad to help remove the eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally follow this up with a second wash with [[ASIN:B000052ZB2 Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce]] to remove all the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, and I have noticed two pimples since I&#x27;ve started using this.  That would be the only downside.  However, it really does leave my 40-year-old skin with a subtle glow.  I really love this, and am glad I gave it a second chance!</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used! It takes off every bit of makeup and dirt including eye makeup, without irritating or drying the skin. Your skin will not feel tight or dry after using it. My skin type is combination and slightly acne prone, but anyone can use this cleanser. You would think oil would be terrible for oily or acneic skin types, but it&#x27;s actually the opposite. Like attracts like - in turn oil removes oil. Give it a try and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Changed my skin! Will never go without this stuff. So amazing</li>
            <li> When I get complimented on my skin I always contribute it to sunscreen and oil cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Smashbox and three different kinds of Shu Uemura cleansing oils.DHC has most natural ingredients of all.No parfum added to DHC cleansing oil is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;6.7 oz. bottle lasts me about 6 months.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to product for makeup removal.  I go pretty heavy on eye makeup and this is magical.  It feels amazing.  Been using it for years.  Will never stop using it.</li>
            <li> It is great for my dry skin(</li>
            <li> I have oily skin - I never would have thought a cleansing OIL would be exactly what I&#x27;ve needed all these years. I only wish I knew it existed before now. It removes mascara easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. What a great product - I would recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Great product, have used for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> I started using this from a tiny sample package, and it&#x27;s worked wonders on my combination mid-50&#x27;s skin.  It did seem a little strange, using a cleansing \\&quot;oil\\&quot; to clean the oily areas of my face which are prone to break-outs, but this formula is so light, rinses completely and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily feel, only clean softness. Don&#x27;t be alarmed that it doesn&#x27;t foam up; it&#x27;s not a soap. You apply it using your hands, massage into your face and neck, and then rinse. It has cleared up dry patches while at the same time reducing the shine in oily areas, and improving the overall appearance of my skin. It&#x27;s like a daily spa for my face!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything out there. I swear. I tried this product and fell in love with cleansing oils (once I discovered how they work, I tried several other brands). I have tried Bosia as well. I think the DHC one is probably the best because of the size of the bottle in relation to the price, the natural low-odor scent (which is basically none, so you know it&#x27;s not loaded with crap chemicals), and it&#x27;s smooth THIN consistency. The thinner the oil, the faster you can spread it over your dry face. Bosia (which you can buy at Ulta) is a little thicker, so it doesn&#x27;t spread and glide over your eye area as fast or easily as the DHC and for the price, the bottle is a lot smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day/night I start my shower water and right before I step in I pump 2 full pumps into my DRY hands, rub my hands together fast to kinda warm up the oil and then apply it to my DRY face and start rubbing small circles all around my face &amp; eye area (I&#x27;ve got the oil in my eyes before and nothing happened because it&#x27;s so light and natural) and then I step into the shower and when the water hits my face, I just kinda rub a few small circles over my face and it rinses completely clean and there is not a trace of waterproof eyeliner or mascara left behind. It&#x27;s AMAZING. I typically follow up with a general face wash like Cetaphil. The cleansing oil is mainly just to remove my makeup, but it&#x27;s probably not 100% necessary because the oil does make your skin feel squeaky clean after you rinse it off. Then I use witch hazel as a toner, and then apply 100% all natural argan oil on my eyes, face, neck, and chest at night. I love the routine because it goes so quickly and effortlessly and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m loading my face up with perfumes, dyes, preservatives, etc.</li>
            <li> There are a few things I can not live without, and this is one of them.  It protects my skin when I wash it and massaging into my face helps circulation.  Always make sure I don&#x27;t run out and have a back up.</li>
            <li> This is a truly amazing cleanser. It is an oil, but it leaves no residue and is terrific. It is the only oil cleanser that you apply with dry fingers to a dry face. Massage, wash off, and the skin feels dewy.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market</li>
            <li> I use this every night to remove makeup.  It leaves my skin so soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> This cleans my sensitive skin (Rosacea) well and doesn&#x27;t irritate it.  I use it in conjunction with their Mild soap.</li>
            <li> Will not recommend the Deep Cleansing Oil because it plugged my drain. I purchased the Dhc bar soap and am using that instead, and I love it. I am also using the bath soap, moisturizer, and toner.</li>
            <li> This product completely cleanses my skin without drying it out. It&#x27;s my favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over a decade. You wouldnt think an oil based product would work on acne prone skin but it works great with zero break outs. Theres a reason why this is one of DHC&#x27;s best selling products. And the seller of this item on Amazon is fantastic. They are very customer friendly.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and absolutely love it to wash my face. So proud I could get it on time, was out of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last 2 years, love it, it works.</li>
            <li> Really love this and will buy more again! Really takes all make-up off very softly and leaving fade so soft and with a glow.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply- works great.</li>
            <li> DHC Deep Cleansing Oil feels exactly like extra virgin olive oil. When you put it in your hands it sort of runs down your palm and onto your wrist if you don&#x27;t use it fast enough. So it is a bit tricky to use but effectively cleanses skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your face parched. I follow cleansing with the DHC Coenzyme Q10 face cream and the DHC Eye Bright moisturizer. You can also use the Velvet Skin Coat before you apply your makeup. By doing all this you will minimize pores and fine lines and also make your skin feel very pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> Nice cleaning oil that cuts through all the makeup grease and oil. This is nice because it washes out clean with water too; I don&#x27;t ever need to use toner to wipe away residual grime. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Best oil to cleanse face that I have found. I&#x27;m on my third bottle.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil feels luxurious, after using for 1.5 weeks I am hooked! I have combination skin and spend a few minutes massaging it into my face morning and evening. I use one pump (and that is generous), which rinses easily leaving no residue. Shipping was fast, product arrived in original packaging. Other have noted the scent, the hint of rosemary is pleasant. I will be re-purchasing!</li>
            <li> Really easy to rinse off &amp; love how it takes off all water proof and face make up completely ! Will order again(:</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product nightly for years and can&#x27;t recommend it enough. At 71, I get so many compliments on my skin.  Deep Cleansing Oil  I feel is a good part of the reason for keeping it at its best.</li>
            <li> Took me a while to get over an oil cleaning my skin, but it keeps it moisturized and removes my makeup well.  On the regular purchase list!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and years.  Glad to see Amazon carrying it.  It is the best facial cleanser on the market.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Nothing I have used removes makeup and sunscreen so completely. I keep purchasing this over and over because of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Best makeup and sunscreen remover! Tried several different oils but this one tops. Best value on the market too.</li>
            <li> Takes off all my makeup including my very hard to get rid of stilla brown liquid eyeliner. Its strong but not abrasive; I also love that it feels like I&#x27;m massaging my face which feels great and also great for my complexion and face muscles</li>
            <li> Good cleaner, clean all make up at once.</li>
            <li> i prefer to use this during the cold months because this will not dry out my skin. it really works in removing makeup, not much for mascaras or waterproof eyeliners, there would still be some residue left even after cleaning it with this so i prefer TheBalm Balms Away to clean my eye makeup. but this is good for all-over the face cleanser, easy to use, no hard rubbing to do when removing makeup and it comes off easily when you wash it.</li>
            <li> Once I discovered this product, I can&#x27;t use anything else to clean my face. I have combination skin, and while it seems totally counterintuitive to use oil to clean your face, it WORKS and it leaves my skin clear and clean. It takes off makeup easily, and unlike a lot of makeup removers, this doesn&#x27;t have any kind of chemical scent so it&#x27;s perfect for people who are sensitive to smells. I try other products when I get samples, but this is by far my favorite face cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great DHC product, in fact this Oil is my favorite.  This never leaves a residue and removes completely and easily.</li>
            <li> BEST MAKE UP CLEANSER I HAVE USED and it really doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue! definitely would recommend and buy again</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  The thought of putting a nice oil on my dry sensitive skin to clean it sounded wonderful, but there&#x27;s no lovely smell, just smells like olive oil, and it doesn&#x27;t take off my eye makeup very well at all.  More often than not I find myself reaching for my Cetaphil, facial cleansing wipes or my Lush cleanser. instead.</li>
            <li> will never use soap on my face again.  I love it...followed by extra virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Melts make-up and cleans without stripping my face or leaving an oily residue behind. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product, reasonable price. Not a substitute for eye makeup remover, however.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using regular  olive oil to cleanse and this is so much less cumbersome and efficient to get on and off your face!!  Great service also.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Since using, my skin is more hydrated and not greasy in any way. Haven&#x27;t had to use my Clarisonic which I used to rely on twice weekly! Lasts forever, one pump is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> It is the best facial cleanser I have ever used. Counterintuitive, but it does not leave you with any oiliness on your skin.  It feels completely water soluable.</li>
            <li> Best cleaning oil ever!</li>
            <li> I love this product; it foams a little and then rinses off easily unlike pure olive oil.  It removes makeup (including the eye area) completely.  Leaves me skin clean and soft (not dry).  It does not clog pores or cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is really one of the best cleansers.  After using it, my face feels clean, but not stripped of its natural moisture.  I live in a dry climate, and this makes a big difference, and also helps my moisturizers to work better.  You use it on a dry face, and then wash it off.  The &amp;#34;method&amp;#34; takes a little bit of getting used to, but the outcome is the best.  On most days, I don&#x27;t even have to use a separate eye makeup remover because it is both strong and gentle enough to get normal work eye-makeup off cleanly.  I have tried a cheaper alternative, and it just was not as good as this one.  I keep a big pump bottle at home and carry the small travel bottle in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best makeup removal product I have encountered. Despite the different packaging (only english, dif spout, no Japanese) from if you order from DHC.com it&#x27;s the same product because have both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a great makeup remover but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t perform miracles. It removes my everyday makeup pretty much in one go. On a night out where I use a lot more makeup I apply and rinse a second time. If you wear water proof stay on all day products it&#x27;s just not that easy to remove. This does its job pretty well I&#x27;d say. All other products leaves my face a greasy colorful mess even after the 3rd or 4th application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior citizen now and my skin tends to be dry.  Other facial cleansers made my skin feel so dry that I always was anxious to immediately apply moisturizer.  This cleanser dissolves any make-up and the ultimate result is moist skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST cleansing oil out there!!! I&#x27;ve tried other cleansing oils and they are nothing compared to DHC Deep Cleansing Oil. That is why I always come back to this one. This is probably my 5th or 6th bottle already. It lasts me up to 4 months, so a little goes a long way. It may be pricey but it is so worth it. I use this as my first step in the double cleansing method. If you don&#x27;t know what the double cleansing method is, look it up. When its first applied its very oily. But don&#x27;t let that scare you. Its meant to be that way for a reason. Then it washes off like a milky consistency. After you pat it dry, its clean and smooth, and its not drying. I love it! DHC website says this bottle sells every 10 second worldwide.</li>
            <li> Love the product - have been using for years.</li>
            <li> good purchase and get my skin clean</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels after I rinse it... very soft and very clean!</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN, AND I USE A CLARISONIC MIA WITH A CREAM CLEANSER.  THIS OIL IS THE PERFECT MOISTURIZER.  IT IS NOT GREASY BECAUSE IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE MUCH TO MOISTURIZE MY WHOLE FACE.  IT KEEPS THE MOISTURE IN MY SKIN ALL NIGHT AND MY FACE DOESN&#x27;T LOOK AND FEEL DRY IN THE MORNING.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! I was so confused when I first used this product because all the reviews were amazing and yet I hated it! It&#x27;s impossible to wash off and leaves all my makeup on my face! After reading the negative reviews, I realize I got a fake. My bottle definitely seems like regular oil instead of the white consistency like it should have. :/</li>
            <li> Get this product! I&#x27;ve never had anything like it! It cleans like no other. I will be a lifetime customer</li>
            <li> I absalutely love this cleanser! I use many diff ones and spent alot of money but i dont think i&#x27;ll ever use anything else. It does not break me out and takes off all my make up in seconds and i wear allot!!! I will never be without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and absolutely love it.  I thought it would leave my skin oily but it leave it soft and supple. I&#x27;d recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this face cleaner - it&#x27;s gentle and gets even the toughest makeup off.</li>
            <li> DHC is a great Japanese skin care brand anything you buy from them is quality. This oil is so surprisingly unique! I have only ever been traumatized by what oil does to my sensitive acne prone skin. I vowed never to use it again! Then I watched a review of this product on YouTube and ordered it. This is my GO TO facial cleanser now! It is the most gentle way to get ALL makeup off in a snap!! You put this product on dry not with a wet face. I would not recommend using this product on bare-no makeup skin just because personally it made my skin a little bit dry that way. This is brilliant brilliant brilliant!! Buy this product now!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy, but you certainly get what you paid for!</li>
            <li> It arrived in 3 days as the promise, and it as good as the past. And it&#x27;s not that expensive, so I want to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> this japanese oil remover I have used for several years, and it is useful for me. the only problem may be the low capacity only 3 or 4 month for me, but it is good</li>
            <li> Best makeup remover ever.  Great for mascara and all over the face.</li>
            <li> arrived promptly, was exactly what was expected. Thank you! I tried this product awhile back and have never wanted to use anything else since (I used a Lancome foaming wash in a blue tube before), this takes everything off EVERYTHING! It says waterproof, no worries, this gets it all off easier than waterproof makeup removers and does not over-strip skin. Do not be afraid that it says OIL, it will not make your oily skin oilier, it will break down the extra oil on your skins surface, though. I gave a sample size of this to my Mom, she says Oh! Yeah! I use oil to take my makeup off....she doesn&#x27;t remember where she got it, where she gets all the great, truly great stuff from...me(.if I love something I want all my friends, and all the women I know - to know my tricks of the trade) ta da, yes me her daughter. She used to use cold cream, same effect - much less labour and rubbing, which is not good for your skin - neither is the cold cream..</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for stubborn hard to remove waterproof mascara. Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth afterwards. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product dissolves every trace of make-up, dirt, and oil.  Leaving my skin soft and smooth. I purchased this for my mother as a gift and now we both use it.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff dissolves makeup and mostly rinses with water.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it says that the product rinses clean with water but does not.  It requires a follow up cleanser to really remove the last of the oily makeup residue.  But if you want truly clean, de-gunked skin, this with a cleanser does a better job than anything else I have ever used.</li>
            <li> very good! thank you so much.</li>
            <li> cleans your face wonderful</li>
            <li> Purchased for the second time already! Lasts a long way</li>
            <li> It suits me. very nice janpanese seller, will cooperate again.</li>
            <li> I have had horrible acne my whole life. I was finally put on acutane my senior year in high school to combat the really bad acne. Acutane changed my life and took away the really huge acne. I am 26 now and I still get acne, not nearly as bad as in high school, but I&#x27;m always looking for the cure to take away my acne. I&#x27;ve been so frustrated because I thought I&#x27;d start growing out of it by now. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING under the sun. The most recent face wash I started using was a generic brand of proactiv. It did alright, but only when I&#x27;d apply the medicine layer. The medicine layer would make my face burn and turn red, but it took away some of my acne so I stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started reading about cleansing oils and I almost bought Shu Umera&#x27;s, but I couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much money on it. I have combination skin that gets really tight and dry without moisturizer but gets really greasy on my nose. I break out mostly on my cheeks, I have big blackheads in my nose, and my skin gets greasy throughout the day. I started using this and I was really skeptical because I thought that oil would make my skin even oilier. This product has been AMAZING. It feels a little weird to use at first, but my skin has never felt so soft, healthy, and breakout free in my life. I seriously cannot recommend this enough. You may think that oil will make you breakout more, but this takes off all of my makeup (including eye makeup), cleanses deeply, and leaves my skin so soft. I occasionally will use St. Ives Apricot Scrub every few days to exfoliate and I have been moisturizing with Cetaphil&#x27;s moisturizing cream. The combo of all of these products has made my skin the best it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful removes 100% of my makeup, goes on my face smooth comes off with little effort. Leaving my face clean for the next step in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been up and down with acne from oil. I read an article about cleaning your skin with oil and that this was a top pick. It&#x27;s evened my skin out and I have no issue with oil anymore. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup remover ever! I wear a lot of mascara and it takes it all off without ripping out my eyelashes. Have been using it for 5 years.</li>
            <li> Could&#x27;ve been a coincidence, but I broke out shortly after starting this cleaner. Face is soft, but not yet convinced this is better than a high quality EVOO.</li>
            <li> Best cleansing product ever. Will buy again and again</li>
            <li> My husband received this as a sample from another purchase he made online (not Amazon). He gave it to me to try and I was hooked! I&#x27;m a pretty healthy eater and I&#x27;m all about the health benefits of olive oil, so rubbing this cleanser into my face feels so clean and refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky to have good skin (not dry, not oily, just even) so I&#x27;ve usually disliked facial cleansers and makeup removers because they feel so drying that even lotion can&#x27;t replenish. I apply this right to my [heavily made up] eyes at the end of the day, and my makeup washes away. I rinse off and apply another bit to the rest of my face, massaging it in. The result is that my face feels deeply clean and deeply moisturized. My face can get a tad dry in winter, so I&#x27;ll look forward to seeing this product perform. You still do need moisturizing lotion, but the clean feeling just can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the price - I&#x27;ve never bought nice facial stuff in my life, so I was quite weary about whether it would be worth it. Hands down, it&#x27;s worth the price. You really don&#x27;t need to use much; I use mine at least once a day and it&#x27;s only down about a fourth of a bottle in 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I got my husband to try it out since he saw me loving it so much. Poor thing, he just couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that it was so wrong to rub what looks and feels like [a more watered down] olive oil on your face! I love this feeling, but I think it&#x27;s important to consider if this visual disturbs you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love DHC products, and I&#x27;ll continue trying new DHC products!</li>
            <li> I love this oil; it makes my skin very soft after rinsing. The quantity is great for the price.</li>
            <li> Great cleansing oil. Removes stubborn eye makeup easily, leaves skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I started using this recommended by a dermatologist.  For the 1st time in my life, I was suffering from a mild eczema.  I couldn&#x27;t believe you could clean your skin with oil, but it works, it leaves your skin clean and supple without the dryness and flaking.  Love this oil!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it! Absolutely best makeup remover ever! I have been using this for many years and it really takes off any types of makeup. Best of best!</li>
            <li> If you have dry sky this product really cleans but leaves your skin soft.  I will certainly  use it again.</li>
            <li> I love using this product.  I cover my face in it as I shower and wash it off when I&#x27;m done.  The oil protects my face as the steam arises and yet helps in maintaining the softness on my face--while also serving as a cleanser.  I&#x27;ve already ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for the face</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser!  I&#x27;m addicted!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to DHC Cleansing Oil with a sample.  It felt wonderful on my skin and left it feeling soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve used it every night now for a few weeks, and actually look forward to putting it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Have always had skin that was in that category of not-terrible-but-never-great:  Not a broken out mess, but sort of oily, always one or two blemishes.  Fought it for years with assorted acne products, about 5 years ago an aesthetician friend got me off the acids/acne stuff, convinced me that part of my problem was that those products are designed for teens (I&#x27;m now 40) and are too harsh for adult skin, it was just irritating it and making the problem worse.  Switching to gentler products helped resolve the acne, but I was still oily and just never looked bright and clear.  Had a recommendation for this about two months ago.  Initial feedback: the sensation of rubbing oil on your face takes some getting used to, but the way it makes your skin feel SO SOFT and CLEAN... I was a fan of how it FELT right away.  Seemed to do a fine job of cleaning, so kept using it.  About three weeks in I started getting compliments on my skin for the first time in, like... Ever.  And just noticing when I was using the restroom and caught myself in the mirror, nothing particularly dramatic, but that my skin just looked healthy and bright.  Defiantly sticking with it.  Use about 3/4 of a pump morning and evening, maybe once more if I&#x27;m doing yard work or at the gym.  Esp like to rub it in and let it sit a minute while I get ready to get in the shower; don&#x27;t know if it does really anything more, just kinda feels like a mini ritual/treatment.  Have priced it out for the travel sizes, and looks like the big bottle is the best value, and the travel size they sell doesn&#x27;t have a pump, so I&#x27;m buying some dropping bottles to fill from the big bottle for my travel and gym bag.  Guessing I&#x27;m 6-8 weeks into regular use and about halfway through a bottle, so I&#x27;d consider it a good value given the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> This deep cleansing oil is truly amazing. I use it to remove my make up (eye makeup too) or to just wash my face at the end of a long day. My face always comes away feeling clean and smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a solution to my menopausal skin for a while. It is dry but I break out on my chin. So I had tried a sample of another brand of cleansing oil and I really liked it, but it was solo expensive. So I searched around on Amazon and this looked good so I figured I would give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super pleased with this. You massage it onto a dry face for a minute or two and then hold a steaming hot washcloth on your face. The oil wipes off beautifully and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel at all dry. My menopausal breakouts are getting under control and almost cleared up. A couple more weeks and I should have lovely clear skin again. I follow this with a wonderful moisturizer I discovered made with red wine. Made by Artful U, butter de cabernet. You can find it here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FX9DTZ6</li>
            <li> Ok, ladies (in particular) - if you want perfectly beautiful skin that makes you look like a million bucks and years younger, with skin so incredibly silky soft and smooth - better than a baby&#x27;s butt, then this is what you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it takes your eye/face makeup off perfectly and conditions your eyelashes making them healthier and stronger is an added bonus, too.&lt;br /&gt;Anything else? Nah..perfection..</li>
            <li> I bought this product (along with two others for comparison) and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;As I am approach 50, the skin on my face gets drier and drier and using any type of soap on my face is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;This cleansing oil keeps my skin from drying out when I wash my face but doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film.  It also removes all make-up quickly and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cleansing oil for anyone who has extremely dry facial skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Repeat purchases.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help get rid of the blackheads on my chin and nose.  It didn&#x27;t, but it also didn&#x27;t break me out like a 14 year old girl which I half expected.  Because this really is oil. It&#x27;s oil!  The enemy!  You&#x27;re smearing the enemy on your face!  But by some miracle of science and the laws of attraction this cleanser yanks make up right off your face, and it actually leaves your skin soft and clean.  I actually stopped getting random zits while using this.  As for the blackheads, well, I dunno how graphic I want to get but they weren&#x27;t so buried in my skin after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I kinda like massaging it into my dry skin. It&#x27;s awkward at first; like not wetting your toothbrush before brushing your teeth would be sorta odd.  (Also, you&#x27;re smearing The Enemy on your face which made me really hesitant and nervous at first.)  Turns out it becomes a nice pampering ritual, and I bet increasing blood flow to your face is a good thing. Just don&#x27;t tug and pull! Anyway, I&#x27;d probably buy this again, and since I&#x27;m not very faithful to my skin care cleansers that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> Love this product. However it is not to be used alone. Use with another cleanser. Removes makeup and oil amazingly!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different than the DHC i used before. Maybe because my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten more sensitive. After using it to remove makeup, my cheeks (where i break out usually) turn really red. My skin has been breaking out a lot. Not sure if it&#x27;s from this.&lt;br /&gt;It does remove makeup very well.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, nice product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gets every trace of make up off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the DHC Deep Cleansing Oil for a couple of years. It&#x27;s gentle, and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleansing oil EVER. Cleans all makeup, including waterproof mascara. Washes off nicely with water. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and find it to be the best thing to use to loosen the sunscreen on my face prior to washing.  I spend a lot of time out of doors and always slather on a lot of sunscreen. At the end of the day, I put a small amount of this product in my hand and then lightly massage it on my face and neck to cut the sunscreen.  Then I wash with my favorite facial wash and the sunscreen is thoroughly removed.</li>
            <li> Was grateful to find this on Amazon --  It does was it says - wonderful oil cleanser !!!!- smooths my skin and leaves it dewey.  I do wash with Kiss my Face Oil Soap - Will continue to order DHC products from Amazon - as they offer them. thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between this oil versus regular olive oil, but this deep cleansing oil is wonderful! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used many different products to remove make up but this one is by far the best. I used to think the little make up remover cloths were the best until I started using this product. There is no pulling or stretching your skin as you might experience with the cloths. You simply pump this into your hand and then rub it on your face and then wash it off with warm water. That&#x27;s it! Your face feels so soft and never dry and there&#x27;s not a trace of make up...even waterproof eye make up comes right off with this. I absolutely love this product. I thought it would have to be wiped off with a cloth since oil and water don&#x27;t mix, right? lol Well, I don&#x27;t know HOW it works so well, but it does. I don&#x27;t even use a wash cloth. Just splash water on my face and the oil and make up rinse right off. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 6 years and love it.  It removes makeup like a breeze leaving my face shiny clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for removing makeup while leaving the skin soft and moisturized.  It is gentle and non irritating, leaving skin feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> This product works great!  I love how clean and moisturized it leaves my skin</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Gets all of my face and eye makeup off with ease!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! I&#x27;ve bought it before and decided to get it again. I love how my face feels clean but not dry or irritated. In an attempt to copy the product, in the past I actually tried to use plain olive oil to wash my face. I didn&#x27;t care for it. First, just using straight olive oil made the olive oil smell too strong. Second, the plain olive oil did not rinse off very well. This cleansing oil, however, has the perfect balance of scent, cleansing ability, and moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this great cleansing oil for years now and my skin couldn&#x27;t look better! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is basically olive oil.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 5 years now.  You don&#x27;t wet your hands or face before using this. Just message the oil into your skin it feels so great. Than wash with water. It is not oily</li>
            <li> Nice as always! Make your skin feel even better</li>
            <li> I recommend this to any body who has a dry but oily complexion. It has done wonders for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a decade! Love it Love it Love it!!</li>
            <li> Nothing gets off waterproof mascara like this cleansing oil.  Leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin with an oily T-Zone. I used it last night for the first time. It took all my make up off and leaving my face squeaky clean, but not stripped dry! It removed my waterproof mascara without leaving me with raccoon eyes, now I can go back to wearing mascara. I most definitely recommend this product. We only have one skin, so take of it. Don&#x27;t sleep with your make up on unless you don&#x27;t mind living with the consequences. Use this oil on dry hands and massage in to your skin all over your face and especially delicate around the eyes and eyelashes and voila! make up free face! Then follow with your own cleanser and skin regimen afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was very happy I purchased this.  It removes all your makeup and really cleans and moisturizes your skin.  Just make sure you follow the instructions to use it on dry skin and then rinse off.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this stuff has been great. I love how it dissolves makeup and dirt. Also my skin has been breaking out less which allows me to wear less makeup. I love this stuff. Best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night!</li>
            <li> Yes - it&#x27;s the best makeup remover ever. I am looking at 40 and still have persistent cystic acne.  This does not bother my skin or cause more problems - but it surely does remove even the stickiest of mascaras.  I do love it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and just as advertised!  Love this stuff!  Skin feels amazing and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this to all</li>
            <li> The best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used! I have combination skin and this works perfectly for it. Even my brother is hooked! He has naturally oily skin and this has helped control it better than any other product. Doesn&#x27;t have a scent and rinses off easily. The best product I&#x27;ve ever used when it comes to removing makeup.</li>
            <li> I accidentally got my husband hooked on this. It&#x27;s a little pricey compared to making your own oil cleanser, but he really likes it and it makes his skin look glowy.</li>
            <li> Great!! I like this product.</li>
            <li> Buying this to remove makeup for the rest of my LIFE.</li>
            <li> Not authentic. Look away</li>
            <li> Love the olive oil cleanser.  Makes my skin feel so good.  I&#x27;m really glad I ordered it for this winter.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes! Other than that, I love this product. It makes taking my makeup off after a long and tiring day SO easy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff; great at removing make-up and moisturizing and softening. Always have a supply on hand. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It took off my make up, but the oil made my face break out the next day.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim after reading about it in several blogs.  I was skeptical at first, about smearing what is basically fancy olive oil all over my face as a cleanser.  To my surprise, it was very effective.  It took everything off including my waterproof mascara and left my skin soft and very clean.  So why isn&#x27;t this a five-star rave review?  Two reasons:  it still irritates my unusually sensitive skin (especially around the eyes) and it is pricey.  Even following DHC&#x27;s guidelines about double-cleansing, I always ended up with a pimple after using this stuff.  It was always very tiny, and it cleared up within a day but I don&#x27;t think any cleanser should do that.  My other acne cleared up though, so I have mixed feelings about this stuff.  I still think it&#x27;s worth a try for just about everyone.  Most of the reviews of this stuff are very positive, for good reason.  I&#x27;ve had skin problems my whole life and I don&#x27;t think I will ever find that miracle product that will never, ever do something quirky to  my skin.  Visit the DHC website, get some samples and give it a spin.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra money to have a product that absolutely does not dry skin, yet rinses clean off afterward. It has a very light fragrance of lavender and smells very much like the products used at the spa.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for years and can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser for my very sensitive and outbreak-prone skin.  It is strong enough to remove all make-up but gentle enough for taking off eye make-up.  Not to mention it smells wonderful and leaves my mature skin without making it feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this cleansing oil.  I have been using the Tatcha cleansing oil for about a year and thought I would give the DHC cleansing oil a try because it is half the price.  It works just as well taking off all my makeup and cleaning my skin.  I also love the smaller three pack for traveling.</li>
            <li> Excellent facewash.  Can wash face as much as you like without drying out.  The more you wash, the better for your skin.  Doesn&#x27;t affect my eyes except to maybe moisturize them as well in frigid winter temps.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser to remove my makeup.  I tend to tear up when I laugh, so I absolutely have to wear waterproof eye makeup which can be challenging to get off.  This stuff removes it like it&#x27;s nothing!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy at all.  I follow up with an acne wash just in case, and I tend to save this stuff for only when I&#x27;m removing makeup since it&#x27;s a pricey, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> As a pharmacist I look for quality in cosmetics. This is so simple, moisturizes well, and washes off easily with water, which I did not expect. It leaves your face clean and smooth. Be sure to use it with dry hands, then rinse with water.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It cleans well and is not oily. I have oily skin and this does not increase the natural oil from my skin.</li>
            <li> The DHC Cleansing Oil is excellent.  Your face stays soft and the skin gets moisturized.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Delivered as described. Love the product- my face feels clean and smooth and this very easily removes all makeup- without having to scrub eye makeup off. Definitely recommend this product. I only need one or two pumps each day, so it should last a while. I will order again from this seller when my bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product from this seller.  Pleased with the product and the seller</li>
            <li> This is an amazing moisturizing way to wash your face. As someone who is past &amp;#34;middle age&amp;#34; I am always looking for an intense moisturizing product that doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy. This product does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used more expensive cleansing oils such as Shu Umura and Bobby Brown and the DHC does exactly the same job at a fraction of the cost. Gets all my make up off (waterproof mascara, waterproof eyeliner, bb cream, blush) when I use it directly on dry clean and rub it around for about 15 seconds before washing off with water. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I was very scared &amp; hesitant to try this cleansing oil because I have very very oily skin. I have also had blackheads in my nose since elementary school. I tried every product that promised to remove the blackheads to no avail. I can now say that after using this product for a week my blackheads are slowly fading away. This is the first time in over 25 years that his has happened. I will forever use this product!</li>
            <li> I have used DHC Deep Cleansing Oil for ten years.  Great if you have issues with rosacea.  Nice to discover that I can purchase it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST face wash I have EVER used . . . best make up remover, too.  I have dry skin, so this is perfect. Often I don&#x27;t even feel like I need to use moisturizer after using this.  I&#x27;ve been buying this for . . . 5 years?  Maybe more . . . I hope they ALWAYS make it because it is the BEST!  Finding it on AMAZON is an extra perk -- so happy!</li>
            <li> Received two samples of this with a beauty order.  Had heard about this product so was excited to try it.  I have 44 year old fickle, mixed complexion skin and cleanser no longer likes my skin.  WELL....this is awesome. It actually cleans without drying. How about that! Anyhoo, as described you rub on dry skin with dry hands and then rinse off.  As an added measure I dry face with a dry facecloth for needed exfoliation spots.  Just ordered a full bottle. :)</li>
            <li> Wash my face with OIL??? WTF?!?! Well that was my first reaction. I have been avoiding facial products with any trace amount of oil in them for decades so this sounded totally bizarre to me. Upon further inspection and reading raves reviews here and on other beauty forums, I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ve tried everything else, so why not? Turns out it&#x27;s a HOLY GRAIL product for me. It is the BEST make-up, mascara and sunscreen remover... period. I was using the MAC version but it was more expensive so I tried this brand and it&#x27;s just as great but a little cheaper. Turns out the best thing for cleaning oily skin and unplugging sebum and blackheads is oil. I&#x27;ve tried the OCM (Oil Cleansing Method - just a mix of oils right out of the pantry) and it was a no-go because it would not wash clean away and always left residue that DID clog my pores. DHC Cleansing Oil washes clean away once it comes in contact with water. I use one pump on my whole face and swirl it around for a minute or two then rinse with water. My skin is clean (no residue that needs to be wiped away with toner), soft and not at all dry or tight. I only use this in the evening to wash away the heavy duty stuff: make-up, mascara and sunscreen. In the morning a light non-soap cleanser or just water is all I need. My skin looks better than it ever has (adult acne greatly reduced). And getting mascara off my eyes is a breeze now - no more harsh wiping, tugging, and pulling around that delicate skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff really cleans all all your makeup without a trace and no raccoon eyes left behind from your eyeliner!  I haven&#x27;t yet used a separate cleanser (which is what they recommend) - thinking of trying the DHC washing powder.  I feel like this stuff cleanses your face pretty well because my face feels smooth and squeaky clean afterwards.  I still need to use a moisturizer after though.</li>
            <li> I really love all products purchased from this line - a bit expensive but well worth it</li>
            <li> I swear by DHC Deep Cleansing Oil!  It is the best at makeup removal - takes off eye makeup and mascara (even waterproof) easily and without stinging.  I have very sensitive eyes and I&#x27;m not supposed to rub them - DHC Deep Cleansing Oil works so well that I don&#x27;t need to scrub at my eyes.  It rinses right off and leaves my skin so soft.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and would never change!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It is the only thing I use to wash my face. It does wonderful things for my skin.</li>
            <li> Best cleansing product ever.  Takes my makeup off quickly and rinses off easily.  It&#x27;s about my 4 th time to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleaning product I&#x27;ve ever used. Works well especially for all kinds of mascara and keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin. This is the best nightly facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried. I tried a sample DHC sent in the mail over 10 years ago. EWG rates the ingredients as safe (I looked them up individually since the product isn&#x27;t rated yet). It takes off all my makeup except for waterproof mascara. It doesn&#x27;t seem to disturb my skin&#x27;s moisture barrier too much; all I need is my normal night cream after I use it. The directions say to apply with dry hands. I use a cotton round for a little extra friction. My favorite beauty product and the only one that hasn&#x27;t changed...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Rice Oil Facial Wash, but wanted to try this product. Mind you it&#x27;s oil, but it&#x27;s too greasy and didn&#x27;t jive with my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It goes on like an oil, then when you add water turns to a gentle soap. It is strong enough to remove even eye makeup, but leaves your skin feeling soft. I cannot stress how wonderful this stuff is. And while it may seem a little pricey, it only takes a small amount so a bottle lasts a very long time. Love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li> Love the stuff. Takes off all makeup easily.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Use a good moisturizer to help with potential drying.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 12 years, I have tried so many cleansers, always choosing the most natural, and this is # by far the very best, I used to order directly from DHC, since I am a prime member my shipping is free and 2nd day delivery with Amazon.  You will love this product, leaves your skin clean fresh and no oily finish.</li>
            <li> It really works! My skin is getting so smooth and clean. :) Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> Best makeup remover ever.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over six years, they&#x27;ve never changed the formula and thank heavens for that.  It&#x27;s gentle, effective and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve usually not used this type of make up remover simply because I have contacts. However when I use the product after I took my contacts out at night it definitely removed all of the make up especially on my eyes including shadow and mascara which I have often found to be really hard for me to do. It did leave my eye lashes a little ouly; however not as much as I&#x27;ve seen in the past without the products. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> You know how people have skincare secrets? Here&#x27;s secret number 1&lt;br /&gt;makeup removal? skin problems? gone! how?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oil cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;Male? Female? we are all dirty and although this is sold primary as a makeup remover oil cleansing is SUPER EFFECTIVE!!&lt;br /&gt;the oil cleansing idea is pretty simple. oil cleanses oil. stupid simple why haven&#x27;t I though of this before simple. It also dissolves makeup including waterproof formulas. I wouldn&#x27;t know about the makeup bit personally as i am male and dont have time to fuss over putting on a face. But my sister love love loveeees this stuff to take off her force field. she dips this stuff into a qutip to fix makeup mistakes too!&lt;br /&gt;this stuff cleanses the excess oil off my face and It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. the oil is actually picking up things on my face like:&lt;br /&gt;dirt, excess oil, sebum, blackhead plugs, and whatever else my skin accumulates. it also helps with softening/loosen/remove skin flakes when i have them. AND THE BEST PART IT FULLY REMOVES SUNSCREEN FROM THE SKIN YAY!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;sunscreen can stay on the skin even after washing it off with a foaming cleanser, who would of thunk?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do i preform this magic?&lt;br /&gt;I normally use this as my first cleanser followed by a regular ph balanced cleanser&lt;br /&gt;sometimes i will use it all on its own if im lazy.&lt;br /&gt;(oh asian skincare you&#x27;re such a babe &amp;#60;3)&lt;br /&gt;I apply on my dry dirty face massaging it into my skin from the forehead down to my neck. I try to think of it as im rubbing the oil into my skin concentrating on areas of my skin that feel contested or have blackheads. i then will wet my hands and continue to massage but now in a circular motions all over my face.  without stripping my skin it gently removes all of the above stated and sometimes I CAN FEEL GRITS ON MY FACE COMING OUT OF MY PORES! after i feel like my face massage has removed all that grossness i rinse it off with regular water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wouldn&#x27;t it be hard to wash off all that oil from the face?&lt;br /&gt;NOPE stuff is magic! it emulsifies and turns milky on the face when you add the water from your hands! I&#x27;m not quite sure how or why (maybe it is just bottled magic?) but it rinses off my face completely leaving behind moist, fresh, CLEAN skin that is ready for my second cleanser to reach deep into my pores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it gets even better!&lt;br /&gt;since i&#x27;ve used this i&#x27;ve noticed my skin being and staying much softer and its so much easier to shave my face after using this! My skin&#x27;s redness and general irritation as well as texture of my flesh has also greatly improved.  on top of all of that it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes if it gets in. This stuff makes me feel like I am winning against my skin problems as well as making sure my skin is moisturized enough which is the BEST THING TO DO FOR ANTI-AGING AND PREVENTING PREMATURE AGING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;if your still not sure if this is for you... DHC has a monthly free catalog that has free samples in it! DHC is a pretty fantastic brand and has some pretty stellar products. oh and the catalog is FREE! I dont think i can put a link in here but if you just google &amp;#34;DHC catalog request&amp;#34; it&#x27;ll bring up the page for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;welp its been swell but the swelling has gone down. hope you found this helpful and you find this stuff works for you as well as it has worked for me.</li>
            <li> First step in Asian face care. Simply the best make up remover.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not oily after washing it off. and it is amazing how well this remove makeup even water proof eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to putting this on my dry face with dry hands, but it cleans well, rinses off easily, and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft without the tightness that other cleansers cause.  A friend has used this product for years and has beautiful skin, and I am now a convert.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face so smooth. Takes off all makeup. Like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best cleansing oil ever. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years. It gently takes off makeup and any other face products you may use, i.e. scar cover or heavy eye makeup. I don&#x27;t use heavy eye makeup, but I do use a bit of DHC liquid eyeliner, DHC mascara &amp; DHC moisture care powder plus DHC lipstick. I do prefer the colors available from Cover Girl/Olay face makeup, but everything else I use on my skin, including the terrific lip cream, is made by DHC. Yes, DHC products are a bit expensive, but you get what you pay for and you can&#x27;t replace beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that is prone to breakout and wrinkles. I had been using a more expensive skin program but it was not doing for my skin any longer. I took a chance and order this and the eye and skin moisturizer.  with in a few days I was blown away. my skin was cleaner and the little bumps and such were going. The wrinkles were less noticeable. My breakouts stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this now for about  2 weeks and am still pleased. Who would have thought.</li>
            <li> Cleans your face great love this oil will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Worth its weight in gold &amp;#60;and price&amp;#62;! Name a company that creates a cleansing oil and chances are that I have used it. Yet each and every time I always coming running back to this staple! This miraculously cleans my face of EVERYTHING yet rinses thoroughly clean when washed after with my facial cleansing. Not so with other oil based makeup removers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!  My skin is dry and this cleanser leaves it smooth and silky like I just had a facial.  Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The bottle is much smaller than what I expected. It works fine but it is not as that fantastic as many reviewers have claimed here. it is expensive in terms of dollar per each ml.</li>
            <li> Read about this in a beauty magazine.  Tried it and I love it.  I use it before my regular cleanser and my skin is so clean and soft after!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a deep cleansing product that is not drying.  This product removes all makeup, including eye makeup easily, rinses off completely, and leaves the skin soft and moist.  I love how my skin feels and looks after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this is the best reasonably priced, high quality cleanser I have found.  It has an oil base but is not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling and removes all my makeup; after cleansing my skins does not feel as taut and dry as with other regular cleansers.  Love this product and you get a large bottle!</li>
            <li> It felt a little filmy on my skin when I didn&#x27;t use face wash afterwards, so I don&#x27;t use it on its own.    However, it&#x27;s GREAT as an eye makeup remover.  I wear waterproof eyeliner and mascara that&#x27;s really difficult to wash off.  One pump of DHC is enough to get it all off - before washing my face at night, I rub it directly on my eyelids with my fingers without any water, rinse, then wash my whole face with face wash.</li>
            <li> I really thought I was going to love this stuff. I have gotten a ton of samples in the mail, so I figured it would work just like that. Unfortunately, the samples were usually used for 3 days and then I went back to my other face cleaner. Well, I get about three days where this stuff is great, but then it seems like after that my skin gets real oily and gross. Then if I quit using it for a few days, it is quite lovely for another three days. Soft, dewy, lovely. When I am out I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and endured the nightly ritual of using the oil, scrubbing my face with DCH olive soap - about 10-15 minutes.  Now, I use makeup remover sheets, so much easier and better for my face.  All that money I spent...sigh.</li>
            <li> Best skin cleanser ever. I would say as good as Earnest Lazlo</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she totally fell in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;She claimed that it really cleansed her face and did not dry her skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to share this because my mom, she rarely praises about things I purchase on Amazon x)</li>
            <li> I tried another brand that claims to be better. It was not. DHC Deep Cleansing Oil beats out all others who think they are competitors. It&#x27;s just the right consistency where the other was too runny. The other was too runny and smelled nasty. DHC has no smell. Safe for sensitive skin. I use it to remove mascara while in the shower. I never have that oily eye problem after using it. It&#x27;s Perfect!! Thank you DHC!</li>
            <li> This really is the best.</li>
            <li> IMHO, there&#x27;s no better cleanser for my fave.  1 pump and that wash removes all of my makeup, foundation, mascara, everything. 2nd pump and that wash removes and leftover grime and oil from the day. If I&#x27;m feeling lazy, I do 2 pumps in one wash and I&#x27;m good to go. My skin had never felt our looked better.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use soap on your face use cleansing oil even if you have oily skin.  Soap will dry the skin further and your face will produce more oil!  Very gentle and cleanses better than soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and can not live without it. It is the best makeup remover! It keeps my skin soft and moisturized. I am so happy to find it on amazon with prime shipping. A definite must have beauty staple.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have been using for a while now.  I have oily/combo skin and this is just perfect because oil dissolves oil and it just rinses away with warm water.  A couple times a week I put a few drops in my palm and add a pinch of table salt for exfoliating.  I love DHC cleansing oil and hope to never be without it.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser ever.  I wear makeup, foundation, heavy black eyeliner, and this baby removes everything....it also moisturizes my skin and I have less lines.  I will most definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice in the past few months. This is better than any harsh makeup remover you could buy. It removes every single drop of makeup. Stubborn eyeliner and mascara? No problem. The ingredients are natural and this is great for ANY type of skin. I have oily combination skin and this keeps breakouts at bay and moisturizes. I suggested this to my sister who has normal/acne prone skin and it works for her as well. The bottle pump is also GREAT, it keeps things from getting messy. I will order this product again and again and can&#x27;t imagine using any other product to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face feeling refreshingly clean but not &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; of all its natural oils. I&#x27;m 60 years old and feel that most cleansers are too harsh. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this cleansing oil.  Takes makeup off and doesn&#x27;t strip my skin.  Have used for years and will continue to use for many more.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST CLEANSER I  HAVE USED. I WOULD TELL ANYONE TO GO FOR IT.</li>
            <li> This DHC product is wonderful. I have tried many of their products over the years. The cleansing oil is one of the first I ordered and I will continue to order for, hopefully, years to come. Here are some tips that may be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;1) Use 1-2 pumps in dry hands. Rub your hands together to warm the oil and apply to your dry face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Work into your skin for 30sec to 1 minute.  Apply warm water and work up an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Rinse and follow with your usual liquid or bar cleanser (I use DHC olive soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Follow with your toner, moisturizer, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin never feels tight or dry when using these products. I also think the price point is average for a product of this type.</li>
            <li> Takes off makeup and leaves skin feeling fresh. Also lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and haven&#x27;t even used a fourth of the bottle.</li>
            <li> waht can i say - wife is happy and life is happy - one of the daily routines of womens care</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without my DHC Deep Cleansing Oil!  I am an actress and a variety of different makeup has adorned my face (and yes, even my arms, chest, and legs at times).  This oil works wonders for an easy removal that leaves my skin feeling great.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> my fave cleanser. Removes makeup and leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil is similar to the Shu Uemura brand&#x27;s cleansing oil, but much more affordable for everyday use. I was using the Shu Uemura Anti/Oxi Skin refining cleanser and loved it (still do) but will be switching to DHC now. It just makes sense at this price point. I still like Shu Uemura better but it is about $80 a pop. DHC does the same job -- it takes off the daily grime, waterproof eyeliner &amp; mascara (even heavy duty MAC LiquidLast eyeliner comes off), basically all make-up, but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dried out. Not an exfoliator, but it leaves skin feeling refreshed and clean for your cleanser, toner, serum, whatever you&#x27;re going to do next.</li>
            <li> meh, ive tried better. this formula is too thick so it makes it a little harder to massage the skin.</li>
            <li> I like it it , it is the most efficient way to remove even eye makeup.</li>
            <li> This remover is better than lots of removers that expensive than it. I uses the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer as base and I tried different kinds of removers, they can never remove everything clearly. DHC can easily remove everything off without rubbing your eyes so hard. But only thing is the oil will stick in your eyes for a little, will gone after few mins.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing oil. Does the job of completely taking off my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have loved this for years.  Gets the oil and makeup off your face like nothing else, no residue and i can&#x27;t live without this now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used better.  Keeps skin from drying out yet cleans deep pores more than you&#x27;d think! Only takes a small amount...oil spreads with water.</li>
            <li> Sadly, made my skin break out in new and unfortunate ways.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this but it really does get all the make-up off!!  I use a real gentle cleanser after to wash the oil off.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an oil based cleanser because my face can get very dry.  The DHC egoes on as oil but creates a cleansing lather that removes the oil  for a clean feeling face.</li>
            <li> It left my face very soft but dry if that makes any sense.  The deal breaker for me was I used it near my eyes to remove makeup it burned and irritated my eyes even after rinsing with water.  Soooo, some makeup removers do that. I would recommend organic, cold pressed, extra virgin olive oil.  Just pure unadulterated olive oil.  As you can see from the ingredients this has chemicals in it to make it slide on your face.  Pure olive oil will give you some resistance and I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d not known of this product but received a sample in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  My skin feels baby soft after use and I believe overall my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have known about this cleanser earlier. My skin&lt;br /&gt;has always given me problems and this product has reduced&lt;br /&gt;them significantly. I thought an oil would be bad for blemishes&lt;br /&gt;but I was wrong. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Received a sample in the mail, ordered it and will never use another product . DHC is truly the best make-up remover I&#x27;ve used....</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  Dissolves any makeup, washes off clean, makes my skin soft and smooth.  I have oily skin, but, this does not make my skin more oily and does not clog pores. Have allergies to many products due to perfumes and other additives, this is pure and does not cause any discomfort or itching.  Great moisture for winter skin!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous.  Cleans well, even removes my mascara.  Leaves my skin clean and soft.  Causes no allergic reaction, which is a problem for me.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser ever!</li>
            <li> Great. but it looks like little oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It removes all of my makeup, including mascara!  Even though it&#x27;s an oil, it rinses of clean with water.  My skin feel clean but not dry.  I&#x27;ll use this in the evening when I get home from work and then wash my face at night with my cleanser.</li>
            <li> Really good. I have been using this cleansing oil for several years!</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil is great.  I needed to convince my daughters that this is the best makeup remover by buying them the small bottles - at first.  Now the full size is part of their Christmas cache.</li>
            <li> The best product out there!  Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I really love it and would love to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it every night and have been doing so for many years.  It does a great job removing makeup and moistening your skin.  The price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil is amazing!  I am the type that will always go to bed with a clean face no matter what (late night partying, Vegas, etc.).  I don&#x27;t use this everyday as I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup, however, on the days I do, this cleansing oil is a must.  This takes off all my foundation as well as whatever residue my eye makeup remover didn&#x27;t clean off.  Eye makeup remover + DHC deep cleansing oil + face wash &#x3D; beautiful clean face.  :)  The best part is that even though this is an oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind.  It washes off completely clean!</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleansing product I have ever used, I absolutely love it! I went from washing my face multiple times daily and still having oily skin to washing once a day and no oily skin! I also don&#x27;t need a moisturizer with this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from a cleansing oil. Since my skin leans toward the oily side I was a little worried. But I absolutely love this! It melts away all of the makeup and dirt on your face. I usually follow it up with a mild cleanser but sometimes I don&#x27;t. I would suggest this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil disolves my makeup, eye makeup.  It is wonderful and leaves a fresh,&lt;br /&gt;soft feeling on my face.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as well as other popular cleansing oils I&#x27;ve tried (MAC, Origins, Josie Maran), but I think my favorite thing is the pump (though you really only need a 1/2 pump at most), the fact that it has no smell, and it washes clean off. I will buy again, but don&#x27;t foresee needing to for a long time because it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 10 years now. It is great at gently removing makeup, including waterproof mascara. I feel like it has hydrated my skin over the years as well as I clean. I usually just use this at night and find it sufficient, especially during the winter. And don&#x27;t be put off by the price - one bottle generally lasts me 9-12 months. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about it for a long time but I never tried it until I saw Bubz from YouTube talk about it, so I thought I should give it a try. Honestly... I dont use it to remove makeup cuz I dont wear makeups... but i use it to remove my sunscreen... yes... you need to remove your suncreen... I have combination skin but my skin kind of changes into a little dry during fall and winter... plus it&#x27;s so dry here in the california desert area... I use one and a half pump on my dry face... and the massage for about 1 minute... rinse with warm water... the cleansing oil doesn&#x27;t not make my face oily, instead ... it moistures my face!!! and yeah... i use a gentle facial wash afterward... my face feels nice after the whole cleansing porcess...  highly recommand this... and it doesn&#x27;t break me out... which it;s great...!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine not using this product now.  My skin, which is wildly sensitive and ridiculously thin, loves it!  I use it exclusively for cleaning my face, but I also now use it for moisturizing.  DHC has a product designed for moisturizing but as far as I can tell there&#x27;s no reason not to just use the cleansing oil for moisture as well, although perhaps it soaks into my skin more effectively than is generally the case.  In any event:  I see improvement in overall appearance of my facial/neck skin, after using this oil for 3 months.  I just don&#x27;t have the dry areas anymore, and pretty much soared through a horrible, frigid and dry winter without that skin showing the stress.</li>
            <li> It is really oily.  My skin became dry after using it and more terribly, some pimples came out from my face, which has never happened to me before. I feel it is stay in my face even I used another deep cleanser after using it. I feel so regretful of buying it.</li>
            <li> feels amazing on the skin and doesn&#x27;t dry me out. I also really enjoy the pure olive smell. Feels very natural and organic, like a facial with every face wash.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample when I ordered some goods from Ulta. I instantly fell in love with it. I only recently started wearing eyemakeup on a regular basis. While removing, I was concerned I was inadvertently causing additional circles by the repeated cleaning. Took me at least five clean cotton pads to be done. That is some serious skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I wanted to spend almost thirty dollars for the oil, I tried out two more products in the interim. Wasn&#x27;t it only a makeup remover after all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so. I tried one from WholeFoods (Herbessence Makeup Remover from Aubrey Organics - about $10), and one other from Sephora (Philosophy&#x27;s Release me eye makeup ~ $20) - with a mixed bag of results. Also you have to use a lot more product. With the DHC you need a minuscule amount on wet skin and it cleans without leaving your skin oily or too dry. Folks claim on forums they can make this at home and I did try that too. Many a times have I used those remedies instead of an expensive product, but sadly for this I did have to plonk the moolah for the quality. One will last you a long long time. DHC also has a huge drive for natural and safe products that are not tested on animals. And counter it with the expensive eye creams that you will NOT be buying, aye?</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  I have been using it religiously for years! Although it is an oil - don&#x27;t let it scare you off. People often think oil is bad.  I would go back to the Italians and Greeks  who have been using olive oil on their skin forever.  Back to the DHC oil- does not make me break out and it leaves my skin soft.  I use on on my neck and jawline to remove the hard-to-get foundation and sunscreen in that area. My skin is really sensitive and I have slight rosacea on my cheeks so the lack of scrubbing is also good for my face.  Also, you don&#x27;t need a lot so the bottle will last a long time.  Note to massage it directly onto your skin and not to use water until you are ready to rinse it off your face.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for about a month now, and it is the best makeup remover/cleanser I have ever used. It does the job removing makeup, but does not leave your face greasy or oily, and rinses off clean. Love it!</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this stuff when I was in my teens!  This is the BEST makeup remover.  You have to use it dry w/DRY hands!  Spread on Dry face over makeup and massage in (gets rid of all blackheads &amp; whiteheads). I then jump in the shower and the oil emulsifies when I rinse my face with warm water.  I shower as usal and then use my regular facewash.  After a couple of weeks of use, my face was radiant and smooth.  I have not had a pimple since other than the occassional monthly hormonal one that is not caused by clogged pores.  It takes a week or two for your skin to purge.  I have recommended it to all my friends &amp; their daughters. The only thing to use for waterproof sunscreen &amp; foundation. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The oil washes off easily and your skin is not oily afterwards. Your face feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This has been a staple for me for years. If you can&#x27;t believe that rubbing oil on your face and then rinsing it off can leave your skin squeaky clean, I challenge you to try it. Massage it into dry skin (it really does need to be dry) and then rinse off with a washcloth. You&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Somehow, on my combo skin, it feels just right. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel stripped, but it is clean. Not much odor, good consistency. I&#x27;m enjoying my mini-facials. Yummy.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup remover and face cleanser ever! I use this to clean the makeup off every night. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect, the best make-up remover and it does not irritate my eyes as some other products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years so it&#x27;s Old Faithful for me. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years . glad I can now order through amazon. Love it and continue to reorder. Cleans make up off easy and leaves face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> This product is a must for removing waterproof makeup. Use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t cause my acne prone skin to break out! Even removes the most stubborn makeup</li>
            <li> Used samples received in the mail and liked this product immediately.  Leave my skin velvety soft and his not greasy at all.  Purchased one for my sister and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with oil cleansing. I have really dry skin and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you guys have all heard amazing things about this cleansing oil, and all if them are true. This does not leave your skin feeling stick or oily but you do get a sense of moisture in your skin. Also it washes off easily while taking off some of the dirt and residue on your face.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, cleans off make-up easily, feels great.</li>
            <li> This oil works really well at cleansing my face of all make up without drying it out!</li>
            <li> I have been getting samples from this company and love this cleansing oil.  It cleans deep and takes off all of your eye make up.</li>
            <li> Love this, all I can say is that is great as a makeup remover, to clean your face and leaves your skin so soft. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I received a sample in the mail and loved it so went online to find more. It removes make up, even mascara and eyeliner, leaves the skin feeling like skin and works miracles on minor blemishes. A teaspoon is all you need and the out of country supplier had my order to me as advertised. It is a little drying so I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff ... removes all the make up effectively and does not dry my face.  Cuts down on so many facial regiments.  Love to work it into my face, and then jump in the shower.  Although it may seem a bit expensive, definitely worth the money.  Contains natural ingredients and works so well.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased DHC Cleansing Oil on Amazon many times, but this one is definitely FAKE.  When I pumped some into my hands it felt a little sticky, but washing it off was almost impossible.  I had to use a different cleanser because the oil stuck to my face.  It felt very greasy, which is not consistent with any other bottle I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I dispense one squirt of this onto dry hands and apply to my dry face.  It totally dissolves my makeup.  Then, I rinse with warm water.  Clean face.  No oily residue.  Perfect!  I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how perfect until I tried another product that was highly rated.  I tried it because it had lavender essential oil in it and I wanted to give it a try.  Used it once and couldn&#x27;t reorder my DHC Deep Cleansing Oil fast enough.  Not straying from the tried and true again.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works perfect! I love it because it takes make up completely but it is still gentle and does not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brutal winter this year and I&#x27;ve been using another face wash which is supposed to be gentle and hydrating.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup very well.  I don&#x27;t even wear much makeup everyday.  I needed something that would take it off, but even more for when I wear a full face of makeup when I go out.  This works pretty well and rinses clean.  I noticed that it dried me out a bit.  My biggest complaint is that my eye makeup doesn&#x27;t come off very easily (it&#x27;s not waterproof) and I feel like I have to rub my eyes a bit which I don&#x27;t like because it feels scratchy and tugs at my delicate eye area.  It is a bit pricey too.</li>
            <li> I have tried other expensive Japanese face oils and the oddly greasy Eve Lom, but this is the best.  Slippery to massage, rinses clean, understated smell, leaves my oily skin clean and soft.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think I would like or use this product very much, but a friend insisted that I try a cleansing oil.  After using it for a couple of weeks I will never go back to any other cleansing product.  It cleans off the make-up and my skin has never felt so soft.  In the winter my skin gets dry and flaky and the oil in a one-time use cleared up that problem.</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself and my mom. At first I was using this straight without water except for washing off...da! Now I know it foams up beautifully and is very moisturizing. Great for after peels. VERY SOOTHING FOR DRY SKIN!</li>
            <li> I used this for about a week after I bought it and then stopped. I feel like it cleanses my face a little too much, and that is a not what I want since I don&#x27;t use any makeup.  I needed to use moisturizer after each time that I used this oil cleanser. This would definitelly work for those who use excessive amounts of makeup though.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. After trying just about every cleanser out there, and still not finding anything that would help me get clear, acny free skin, I finally gave up and stopped using all the stuff I have been putting on my face. A week later, my skin is so much cleaner, acne is fading (even a spot that has been on my face for about a year) and my face looks radiant. Also, I&#x27;m not using any moisturizer at all and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;My routine now consists of splashing hot water on my face a few times, then cold, hot, cold, hot and end with cold (sort of like contrast shower). I let my face dry on it&#x27;s own. In the morning, I only splash luke warm water on my face and let it dry on it&#x27;s own. Easiest routine I&#x27;ve ever had and my face now in a better condition that it has been in the last half a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> So much better than the Josie Maran cleansing oil. I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have ever used. Takes off all make up. My son uses it for teenage acne.</li>
            <li> The product that I received from this seller smells rancid, like olive oil that has gone bad. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil rinses completely clean in water! !  I wish it smelled a little better... it smells like olive oil,  but I can&#x27;t complain.  I&#x27;m never using another cleansing oil again.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and have been using this for 2 years now. I use this product every night to remove makeup. I use an additional product from my dermatologist afterwards, so I can&#x27;t say this gets everything off 100%, but it does a dang good job. It also helps keep my skin hydrated and never clogs my pores or causes breakouts. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and it is excellent, does not dry or irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I still have to exfoliate after using this to be sure all of the makeup in out of my pores.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil is amazing.  It melts off makeup in minutes without scrubbing.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face too greasy as I was worried about.  I have used samples for years and I finally purchased.  I&#x27;m so glad I did because my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil can remove the makeup very well, but my skin feels so oily after using it. I have to use A LOT OF facial cleanser to remove its residue. I have oily to combination skin, and I was afraid that this cleansing oil might result in breakouts but I gave it a try anyway because of the high rating. I did get some small breakouts after using it twice but I am not sure if it was the cleansing oil. I may never figure it out because I don&#x27;t want to risk getting breakouts again on my acne prone facial skin and I don&#x27;t like the heavy residue after applying it.</li>
            <li> So I finally finished my first bottle of DHC Deep Cleansing Oil after using it to remove my makeup daily for over a 1 year and a half!&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, the reason I got was because I read an article on Cosmo about how oil helps remove dirt and clear blackheads on your face. So I decided to give this cleansing  oil a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used it, it did not go well. I massage my face with this oil for about 2 mins, focused on my nose and my chin a lot because there was clogged pores and white/blackhead. And I got multiple acne on my chin area from doing this :( (ps: I&#x27;m don&#x27;t have acne-prone skin! I rarely get breakouts on my face, only 1 or two before/during my cycle) I was ready to give up this bottle because of this breakout incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read several more reviews about this cleansing oil, turns out I massaged it on my face for too long and that was why my skin got irritated by all the circular massaging motion on my chin! After my acne disappeared, I decided to give it a second chance. I solely used it to remove my makeup, and stopped using it as a facial massage oil/blackhead remover or whatever people claim it does beyond removing makeup ---- and it worked out great for me! I used it before I hop in the shower:pump it once to get some product in my dry hand, gently spread it on my face, gently massage it into my face using circular motion, and I only do this for 30 seconds. That&#x27;s plenty time for me to remove my waterproof mascara and my foundation. Then I just get in the shower and rinse it off. I follow up with a regular facial cleanser too. I find this has helped a lot. I prefer removing my makeup using the oil, because it&#x27;s so easy and it doesn&#x27;t take too much to get my face clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffered breakouts from this product, next time try to use less force when massaging it on your face, and only do it for a short amount of time! 2-3 mins of rubbing/massaging is too long, it&#x27;s almost guaranteed that you will breakout no matter what you do.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. All trace of makeup is gone, and my skin has never been this good.</li>
            <li> I have been using DHC Deep Cleansing Oil for about 5 years now. Originally I wanted something to help take off makeup that wouldn&#x27;t strip my face and didn&#x27;t have a bunch of weird chemicals in it. It works great for that, but now that I don&#x27;t wear makeup, it is also great just as a face wash. I use it with my [[ASIN:B002VAZINQ Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System - White]] and alternate with [[ASIN:B0009ET4QI Beauty Without Cruelty Facial Cleansing Milk, Extra Gentle 8.5fl oz]], which is another very gentile and natural facial cleanser. I wish I would have had a skin cleansing regimen this gentile when I was in high school when I really needed it instead of all the super harsh chemicals I thought I needed to get my acne/ super oily skin to behave. I now know that the more gentile you treat your skin with good quality products, like this oil, the less oil your skin will produce trying to hydrate itself. I haven&#x27;t had to use any acne products since I started using the deep cleansing oil. Definitely give this a chance and think about the other two products. I LOVE the Mia brush with the sensitive brush head!</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for several years to remove makeup, and occasionally to moisturize my face (I live in the desert). In  addition to the large bottle I have purchased the small travel size which meets TSA restrictions.  Hate it when  I run out.</li>
            <li> This is my highest holy grail product out of every skincare, makeup, cosmetic, shoe, purse, etc I own. I start using this cleanser when I had acne as a teen, I am now 27 and this cleanser still meets my skincare needs. The beauty of this cleanser is you can use it if you have oily, dry, sensitive, or acne prone skin. You will never have to switch cleansers as you age if you use dhc deep cleansing oil. I had cystic acne for years, this product rid me of that after trying every product under the sun. It does not treat acne, however it cleanses so deep it removes the cause of acne- clogged pores, congested skin, not properly cleansing. It has a neutral olive smell, very gentle on the skin &amp; eyes, a bottle will last you 6 months to a year. Oily acne prone girls- do NOT be afraid to use this. Oil cleanses oil. So the oil breaks down all your makeup &amp; dirt and this product rinses clean so there is no greasy residue to try. The first week of using the oil, my pimples stayed on my face and did not get worse. I then noticed blackheads on my nose coming to a head- this oil is great to use before doing self extractions on blemishes! After 2 weeks my face began to clear up. The longer you massage it on your face the better the glow &amp; the deeper the cleanse. The great thing about DHC is it doesn&#x27;t hurt you if you use it daily or several times a day. Even though I love dhc oil I still like to rotate products on occasion to test new things out- but they are so strong and drying I cannot use them twice a day. I ALWAYS come back to this product. The ingredients are so natural &amp; gentle it will not dry you out &amp; you wont get any kind of reaction. DHC is amazing with free samples as well, you get free samples every single month in their catalog. You can easily write to them for a sample of the dhc deep cleansing oil and get a free sample if you are unsure of buying a big bottle. I have tried DHC&#x27;S other cleansing oils, and I have to say they do not compare to the original deep cleansing oil, and I have tried MAC&#x27;s &amp; Lumene&#x27;s cleasing oils and they leave behind a residue unlike DHC. I have my mom with normal skin on this cleanser, my aunt with sensitive skin, my grandmother with dry skin, and myself with combo/acne prone skin (formerly oil) on it. So this cleanser is truly for everyone. Most women wear makeup, and they use cleanser to remove it- but DHC is specifically a MAKEUP REMOVER which is so important. If you read the back of the bottle of most cleansers they say they remove oil, &amp; dirt, they are not designed to remove makeup. DHC deep cleansing oil IS designed to remove makeup, it has the ingredients to break down foundation &amp; greasy heavy concealers. Always use it on a dry face, I like about half a pump. Too much oil on your hands and it doesn&#x27;t melt the makeup off as well. A thin layer of oil on your hands will heat up with your fingers and really bring blackheads to the surface &amp; get rid of every trace of makeup- no toner needed! It is worth a try, and if you wear face makeup, it is a must!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered this product from anywhere but the official DHC website. It was not labeled for sale in the United States. Luckily I know this product well, so I know the drill, but if you need directions or assurance this product meets  FDA standards you may want to contact the seller before you purchase!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes while it cleans</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for myself but did not have it long as my son decided he liked the cleansing oil.  He has not complained and he has been satisified with the product.  I would recommend this product to anyone to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is great. it can remove the make-up quickly and completely.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product many times before and never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Great for removing eye makeup,  mascara and all.</li>
            <li> Living a cold winter weather of the midwest this has been so helpful in keeping my still from being dry. I hate a cleanser that after cleaning and when your skin is dry it feels like it could crack. Before even putting moisturizer on after using this my skin already feels moisturized.</li>
            <li> This cleanser gets all my makeup off my face without making my skin feel tight.  Unlike plain olive oil, it emulsifies and rinses clean so there&#x27;s no residue at all.  It&#x27;s great for all skin types, even oily/combination skin like mine, and I can see myself using it for many years.  I just wish it was less expensive...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It removes eye make up but is really gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Been using DHC Deep Cleaning Oil since it came out. Soap doesn&#x27;t touch my face. This stuff is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. Try it at least once, you&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser twice a day. It rinses completely, has no fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and clean. Also, my skin has cleared of blemishes. Looks like one doesn&#x27;t need harsh drying cleansers in order to have clear skin.</li>
            <li> excellent! I know removing makeup is so much more important than putting on makeup.. It is the best choice to use this product for my face. No regret!</li>
            <li> I dont know how but this thing is a miracle cleansing oil. It really goes into the pores and helps with my daily exfoliation! The Japanese know whats up....</li>
            <li> I wash my face with this every night and my combination aging skin has never looked clearer!  This is a great make up remove and even though you may feel apprehensive at first about using oil to cleanse, I can guarantee that it makes your face feel just as clean as soap--which will actually strip your skin of essential oils.  I use prescription retinols on my skin so a gentle cleanser is what I need and I have it in DHC!!</li>
            <li> Product as described.  My GF used it daily and she feels it is a great value.  This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> The Best!&lt;br /&gt;Cleans &amp; leaves your skin feeling super soft!!&lt;br /&gt;Dissolves mascara (waterproof) with awesome smoothness, no need to worry about losing eyelashes on this cleanser</li>
            <li> I originally got a sample of this and was hesitant to try it but it works great and does not leave an oily residue. I use it when I have makeup on and also when I don&#x27;t; really god smell too!</li>
            <li> I use this wonderful cleansing oil along with my Olay Sensitive cloths.  I love how it feels; it gets off your makeup quickly; it rinses easily; and it does not leave your face feeling tight.  Also, there is no weird smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleansing product I&#x27;ve ever used.  It gently removes EVERY trace of make-up, no scrubbing involved.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product by DHC.  It&#x27;s the number 1 selling item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for getting off makeup and leaving face clean.  Non oily.</li>
            <li> This cleanser really deep cleans and keeps my dry skin moisturized. I even use it after waxing my eyebrows to help dissolve any wax residue.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t believe an oil could cleanse your skin but it does a fabulous job!!&lt;br /&gt; I use it alone or as a 1st step, followed by a Ponds cleansing cloth.  It removes the heaviest of mascara &amp; eye makeup &amp; makes your face feel clean but not tight.</li>
            <li> I used to get a catalog from the company who makes this - but never sent for anything.  It&#x27;s a bit steep in cost, but really clears off makeup well - you put it on dry to your face and work it in and then wash it off.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser that anyone could ask for.  It is not drying, and cleanses perfectly</li>
            <li> Great for deep cleaning and softening - esp. in winter.</li>
            <li> The best product bar none for a soft super clean face!</li>
            <li> After going through all my DHC catalog samples, I had to break down and finally buy this product because I love it so much! Easily removes all traces of dirt, grime, and makeup from my face. I still use a separate eye makeup remover, although this product does an ok job on its own. I love layered skin care regimens, so this is my first step at the end of my day. I follow up with another cleanser out of personal preference, but by no means is it necessary.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with purchase and seller</li>
            <li> Very nice product and I have oily skin!  At the end of a long day this oil blends with facial oil and loosens clogged pores.  It rinses with water and your skin feels clean with out drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic for removing sunscreen, which I wear every day, and makeup, which I seldom wear.  I always follow it with a gentle cleanser to remove any traces of the oil and sunscreen and/or makeup.</li>
            <li> I have read absolutely every review on this product on amazon and all I could find via google.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone fair skin, not easily burned in summer since I am olive toned albeit fair. When I say acne I mean everything from tiny bumps to huge cystic acne under the skins surface that is both painful and impossible to get rid of with any topical product. I don&#x27;t take any acne medications orally as I am trying to get pregnant and treat my body like its pregnant in preparation. So nothing goes on or in my body you can&#x27;t take/use during pregnancy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this as most other folks who have reviewed have been introduced to the product. I had never heard of DHC or it&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Oil, and as most acne sufferers I was petrified to try it as putting oil on combination acne prone skin seems counter intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered my first bottle because after finally using my sample last night- all of my 32 pimples but 1 (yes I counted how many were on my face, and yes my face hurts all the time) have diminished in size, color, and pain level. My face feels moisturized but not oily, clean but not stripped of all moisture. This product literally gave me OVERNIGHT results on my severe pizza face. THAT IS SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the skeptics- request a sample from this company and give it a try. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different by miles and for some it may not be the ideal product, but maybe it WILL work for you- you don&#x27;t know for sure until you try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some research I&#x27;ve done makes so much sense I will share it with you:&lt;br /&gt;Oil bonds with oil. Water and oil do not mix or bond. So think about it- this oil bonds with all the \\&quot;extra\\&quot; surface oil on your face and leaves your skin with a correct balance. Water based oil free cleansers that contain basic, and even no soap or detergents, DO NOT bond with the excess oil, they instead completely strip the skin of ALL oils and leave the skin tight and dry. Skin then over compensates for the dryness by becoming overly oily and causes- you guessed it! ACNE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. You might love it. I only had a dime sized amount ONE TIME and I am in love with this product already.er compensates for the dryness by becoming overly oily and causes- you guessed it! ACNE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. You might love it. I only had a dime sized amount ONE TIME and I am in love with this product already.</li>
            <li> I like the oil products, they really do the job. My skin feels so smooth after I&#x27;m done and I think the size of the bottle is a great value.</li>
            <li> I have used the Deep Cleansing Oil for approximately one week and noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin, and well as improvement with blemishes.  I have combination skin with Rosacea.  I have also noticed my skin is less sensitive and less oily in the T-zone.  I have not noticed any change in general redness, but I would still highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing oil, which I&#x27;ve never used before. My skin feels balanced and doesn&#x27;t go from oily before washing to dry after washing. I use less moisturizer because of this product. It also removed make-up really well so it&#x27;s basically two products in one: make-up remover and cleanser. I pair it with an all natural exfoliation wash to help remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> This is THE skin cleanser. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is great  cleansing oil for dry skin! I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as usual! It suitable for me to remove make up efficiently. P.S. I have sensitive skin. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing oil. It works so well to take off makeup with out irritating skin. I had problems with many makeup removers making my skin red and dry, but this wonderful product does neither. This not only dissolves my makeup but leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh as well as pampered. 10 out of 10, would buy again!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup remover</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft. Rinses clean with no oily residue.</li>
            <li> this does not dry out your face but my skin has this weird filmly feeling after using it. I definately have to wash my face with a regular face wash after using it to remove makeup. I was hoping this product would be one step. I hate to wash my face too much because I feel like it gets too dry. It is pretty good at removing makeup though.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and find that many cleansers left my skin dry and tight feeling, especially during the winter.  This cleanser is the first one I&#x27;ve found that actually leaves my skin feeling soft, not dry.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and absolutely love it.  I use it year round and nothing else!  If you have dry or aging skin I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about this face wash.  Oil to WASH with?  I tried a sample of it that I got in the mail and was pleasantly surprised.  It really doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of natural oils and gets makeup off easily with a few rubs.  The bottle has lasted me a long time, and one squirt is more than enough to cleanse your whole face.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but I appreciate how well it works and how few ingredients are in it.</li>
            <li> I have pretty normal skin, and live in a dry climate. I find this cleansing oil very drying, and it might even be better for an oilier complexion than mine. Paired with a really good moisturizer, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 5 years. I tried several other products, but it dawned on me it&#x27;s the best because I want to remove my foundation on my face, perfectly!</li>
            <li> So easy to use, very little scent, a little goes a very long way, and all my makeup comes off with a good massage and a good rinse with water.  My very dry skin is a little less dry too.  I will buy this oil cleanser again.</li>
            <li> I started using this after reading about using cleansing oil instead of regular facial wash in a makeup magazine.  Weird idea, I thought, but I&#x27;ll give it a shot.  I love it.  It removes all traces of all makeup and rinses clean.  I was surprised.  After only a week, my skin felt smoother and I think it looks better.  It seems pricey, but one pump is all it takes each night.  I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for 3 months and at this rate it will last at least 6 more months, so I&#x27;m happy.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, have tried tone of skin care, so far no irritation on my face.&lt;br /&gt;very good product, will recommend it to friends and</li>
            <li> I had great doubts about using oil as a cleaning agent, especially since I have combination skin. Having seeing great reviews for this though, I went ahead and gave it a try. I am not a heavy makeup wearer, so I don&#x27;t know how well this would work for them. I do wear the basic waterproof mascara, foundation, setting powder, etc, and using this as the first step of my cleaning process works very well. I did have issues with clogged pores, especially around the nose area. Using this cleansing oil, I have noticed that my pores look drastically cleaner, and therefore, smaller. They&#x27;re still visible, mind you, so don&#x27;t assume that your pores will disappear with this product. It does work well for me, so I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> What an amazing product! Leaves skin feeling soft and really clean, not greasy at all. It dissolves great with water. I didn&#x27;t expect to like it this much, but all the reviews are true. AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Reasonable priced product that does the job.  I really wanted to try the Julep brand but couldn&#x27;t spend the money.  This get everything off including my cannonball waterproof mascara.  I&#x27;ve saved money on buying makeup remover with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use every evening before bed and can see the difference it makes in my skin.</li>
            <li> For some reason I have always battled with getting mascara off my eyelashes/eyelids by the end of the day. No matter what I used, Coconut Oil, Avocado Oil, all drugstore make up removers, vaseline, lotion, baby shampoo -- nothing worked. I would always wake up and have my lower lash line smeared with a tad or a lot of mascara residue! No Bueno! Luckily, I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin, but still I want to keep it clean! Honestly the cleansing oil works wonders! Sometimes I use it by itself if I feel that my face didnt get too dirty and I only wore light make up. But generally I use it with a gentle cleanser like recommended by other users. If you&#x27;re having difficulty getting your make up off like me, try this! I feel like I have finally beaten mascara in my night time regime.</li>
            <li> Great face wash that cleanly removes oil or silicon-based moisturizers and sunscreen. One of the best oil cleansers for the price, and the packaging works very well to dispense the correct amount of product.</li>
            <li> Wife bought this and LOVED it, we live use to live in Cali and when we moved to AZ she could not find anything for the dryness here.  After she used this her skin is no longer dry and it helped with breakouts too.  She had her friends from Cali try it out too they all liked it so much they all bought bottles</li>
            <li> Ooh, love this stuff. And the bottle lasts a long time. Definitely a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> The best make-up remover I have ever tried. Make-up melts off, leaving my skin soft as silk.</li>
            <li> Why haven&#x27;t I discovered this product till now.  It really cleans off all my makeup without overdrying my face.  Amazing that it&#x27;s an oil as I usually stay away from anything with &#x27;oil&#x27; in it.  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> My sensitive, rosacea skin loves this product.  I have tried many, many products to cleanse my skin, including &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; formulations my dermatologist recommends.  Most work well for a few weeks, sometimes a month or two, and then my skin becomes irritated and rosacea &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; prone.  I use this daily at night, followed up by my moisturizer (I use water only in the morning).  It gives my skin moisture without feeling greasy.  I would recommend this to anyone who has ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I had never heard of a cleansing oil until recently.  I have a lot of skin difficulties (psoriasis), and even skin allergies.  My skin has become very dry in the last year and other products were causing my face a lot of trouble. I have been using this produce for about a month now, and I love it!  It takes off makeup perfectly, and I don&#x27;t have to do two steps to wash my face.  Try it!  You will be amazed!!</li>
            <li> this product is just ok,</li>
            <li> Great product that leaves skin soft and moisturized. I enjoy using it with my exfoliating brush to really clean out my pores and skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome! At first I was hesitant about using it because of the whole oil aspect of it, but I am glad I did. I have very dry skin, but it appears oily on the surface. I also have hormonal acne on cheek and jawline.  I had tons of clogged pores mostly blackheads that I have trying to get rid of for 8 months using salicylic acid and retina. These product made my face so dry and miserable that it made my acne worst, it didn&#x27;t get rid of the blackheads either. After struggling with hormonal acne for 8 months I realized that drying out your skin makes your acne worst, and for me, acne medicine like retina, salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide only aggravated my acne and made it worst. I try to limit the things I put on my face, and do not put on make up so my face can breath and heal. For the past 4 months I gave been using Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Foam Cleanser and Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion (only a moderate amount of 1/2 pump for my entire face) day and night. I would also apply a little sunscreen to the areas of my faces that has age spots and I would always wear a 7&amp;#34; brim hat during the day when I am outdoors. With that being said, I felt the cleanser I was using for best 4 months wasn&#x27;t 100% removing the sunscreen or junk that was building up on my face. I decided to incorporate the DHC cleansing oil in my nightly routine. I&#x27;ve been using the DHC cleansing oil for a month and I love it. It helped with the pH balance on my face. It also made my skin smoother, and helped with loosening the blackheads I had on my nose, cheek, jawline area so I can extract it more easily at night when my face is clean. Plus, it did not cause me to break out. Yay! So now, at night I use 2 pumps of DHC cleansing oil for 60 seconds, then I would wash with the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Foam Cleanser for 30 seconds and then apply my 1/2 pump of Cetaphil lotion. My skin looks and feel so much better after incorporating the DHC cleansing oil..my blackhead on my face is 80% better than 8 months ago. I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but if you are looking for a cleansing oil to try...DHC is probably your best BET!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 5 years, it&#x27;s the best make-up cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cleansing oil. I&#x27;ve been using Boscia Makeup-Breakup Cool Cleansing Oil for about a year  and loved it until I found this. DHC removes makeup better than Boscia&#x27;s and it&#x27;s cheaper. I wear waterproof mascara everyday and this oil leaves no residue, i&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Cleans extremely well and is good quality for the price. I used to use Shu Uemura cleansing oil but this one works just as well and is one half the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and really like it.  Helps moisturize while cleaning my skin.  With older skin, dryness now is more of an issue than it used to be so I like the fact that this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but actually helps rehydrate it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite cleansing oil. Its quality is good for sensitive skin with a resonable price. I will buy it again later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, helping me remove make ups quickly and cleanly. So I will recommend it to others who want to buy remover.</li>
            <li> Made me break out, now i have one cleansing product cluttering up my bathroom shelf.  I force myself to use it to remove my eye makeup to use it up.</li>
            <li> This product is good for taking taking out the make up in just one step, though is not as good to take my mascara (not waterproof) out as it was the SHU UEMURA oil.&lt;br /&gt;This cleansing oil is thicker than the shu uemura but clears out easily with water and leaves the skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price is a good cleanser, but I would stick with SHU UEMURA if I could afford it!</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this oil, it caused me acne on my face. I thought I made a wrong decision buying this product. But as I use it more and more, I notice my skin condition is better and better. Every time I have makeup, even I only have BB cream on my face, I would use the DHC cleaning oil to clean my face. It becomes the first thing I&#x27;d love to do when I go back home. If you use it right, clean it thoroughly afterward, you will definitely see how well it will work on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of this product since five years ago, and finally I got it. IT IS INCREDIBLE!!&lt;br /&gt;1. For eye-make up cleaning, you just SIMPLY CLOSE YOUR EYES, PUMP ONE DROP and RUB ON YOUR EYES for a little while, it cleans all the eyeliner, mascara and eye shadow mildly and completely. It is very impressive!! And, EVEN YOU GOT IT INTO YOUR EYES, IT DOES NOT IRRITATE at all!!&lt;br /&gt;2. For make-up on other parts of your face, of course it works very well too.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suggest to use it when there is no make-up on your face. Some people said it does not work on them, maybe they just did not use it in the right way since there is no directions on the bottle or in the box, I usually use 2 pumps and rub it on my whole face, I suggest that do not wet your face or hands before using this, you can wash your hands and dry them before you use this product. You will like it!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years great for taking off makeup even eye makeup.. Big fan</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for years. I would not be without it. It is gentle yet through.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad.  I loved this product when I first used it.  Stearyl glycyrrhetinate:  ester of stearyl alcholol and glycyrrhetinic acid.  Stearyl alcohol:  Stenol.  A mixture of solid alcohols prepared from sperm whale oil.  Unctuous, white flakes, insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol, to obtain a firmer product at ordinary temperatures.  Used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetic creams, for emulsions, as an antifoam ingredient, and a lubricant; also in depilatories, hair inses, and shampoos.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost eight years as my exclusive morning and night facewash. I have yet to find makeup that this product doesn&#x27;t completely remove - heavy eyeliner, longlasting lipstick, full coverage foundation, you name it. It all just comes right off without leaving that tight feeling on the skin that a lot of other soap-based cleansers do. All it takes is a couple of pumps of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, acne-prone skin but this leaves my skin in great shape and seems to help control oil production. If I have the bad occasional breakout, it won&#x27;t help heal it but does seem to calm the redness right after I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I have found is that the normal 6.7 oz. bottle cannot be secured well for travel so I usually end up decanting some into travel-sized plastic bottles. Or if you order through DHC, you can get free sample-size packets which I usually save up for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I intend to keep buying this product as long as they keep making it which I hope will be for a long long time!</li>
            <li> You can use this everyday and it will not dry out your skin. If you have acne prone skin you will probably still need a cleanser with medication but this is helpful because harsh cleansers also cause breakouts. This is nice and gentle and really does clean up dirt!</li>
            <li> I have been using DHC Deep Cleansing Oil for over seven years.  I have really oily skin, but that has not been as much as a problem as it was for me when I was younger - - as an actor, I had to be &#x27;powdered&#x27; so often when doing commercials that by the end of the shoot, I felt like I was wearing two tons of product on my face!  So, one would think that anything with the word &#x27;oil&#x27; in it would not be welcomed by me, but I am so happy with this cleanser!  It is DHC&#x27;s best seller, and it deserves that title.  It removes all my makeup - face and eye, and after I use it my skin is soft and almost transluscent.  I will always use this - it is not expensive, it lasts quite a while, and I cannot remember what I used before, but I know whatever it was, it left my face irritated - forgot to mention I have very sensitive skin.  I recommend this product for women at any age.  You will be very satisfied.  Rennie Manning</li>
            <li> I bought this after receiving a sample in the mail.  I absolutely LOVE it!  Removes makeup better than any product I have used before (Mary Kay, Estee Lauder, Clinique).  Leaves my face feeling very clean and moisturized. I plan to try other DHC products as well.</li>
            <li> Smells overwhelmingly like olive oil. It definitely helps with dryness but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s breaking me out or not. I&#x27;m a convert though, I definitely like the feel of cleansing with oil, and this is a great starter price.</li>
            <li> this is about the only thing I have found that will take my eye makeup off at night</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve used makeup wipes for so long. I wish I had found out about this stuff years ago! The oil is great for oil cleansing and what I absolutely love about this product is.. it is water soluble. Rinses off so easily, it&#x27;s just magical and great and I will probably use this to remove my makeup for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews touting the glory of this stuff, so I went out and bought two bottles thinking I had found the magic for my skin.  This stuff fell so flat that I tried to sell what I had left on ebay.  It did not clean my skin at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really love this DHC product, it is the best cleansing i have used. Price is also fair. Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite cleanser. I have very dry skin and all soap regardless of how gentle, dries my face. The Deep Cleansing Oil is awesome. Oil cleaning is a very efficient and healthy way to clean your skin. This oil is special in that after you massage it in as an oil and remove your makeup - it rinses away with water. Water soluble oil. Who&#x27;d have thunk it?</li>
            <li> Still can&#x27;t believe how putting an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my face work so darn well. It&#x27;s a wonderful cleanser and leaves my skin soft and smooth. I think it&#x27;s even improved my rosacea. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go anywhere without this!</li>
            <li> This is simply the best makeup remover out there. It&#x27;s water-soluble olive oil. It is as thick and slick as olive oil. To use, pump onto clean dry hands and rub all over your face. All of your makeup will start smearing - all of the layers of sunscreen, primer, foundation, powder, mascara - all of it. There&#x27;s no tugging on your skin while you do this. Then rinse away with warm water. I follow up with sudsing cleanser just in case, but I know some people just moisturize and call it a job done.</li>
            <li> The oil is really light with a thin consistency and washes cleanly off the face. I thought it would make my skin sticky but it came completely off. You really don&#x27;t need to use a cleanser afterwards. It got through my mascara completely and left my skin feeling supple. It also has a subtle herbal scent that&#x27;s really pleasant without being overpowering. I&#x27;m really happy I bought this :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year and I love it. I will continude to use this product.</li>
            <li> It burns my eyes so I can&#x27;t use it.  Eye make-up remover almost always gets in your eyes a little or is absorbed through the lid.</li>
            <li> I use this every night to remove makeup. DHC directs you to follow with a gentle soap and toner, but the cleansing oil is so effective that sometimes I finish with cotton pads and a witch hazel toner. I used to think one shouldn&#x27;t clean their face with oil, but I was so wrong. This cleansing oil leaves your face clean AND soft. No parabens, either.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th bottle of DHC Deep Cleansing Oil. I love it since I started using it last year. Not sure the reason why when this 4th bottle came, the color of the oil was yellow-greenish, not like the pure yellow I saw in previous bottles.I checked but did not see the expiration date, so not sure what went wrong with the product. I felt like it made me break out. I didn&#x27;t have this problem with my previous bottles though. Hate to spend more money to get a new bottle. I might have to order it somewhere else.</li>
            <li> OMG OMG OMG!! This is the best thing ever!! I&#x27;ve only used it for 3days 2 times a day and I&#x27;m not kidding I&#x27;m in love!! &amp;#60;3 it emidiatly gave me a glow!! My cheeks have this rossy color know! It made my skin feel so soft and look awesome! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Amazing how it cleans your face!!!! No oily trace... Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this face cleanser and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser, however, I normally just use olive oil to clean my face.. (yes, to CLEAN my face) (research if you don&#x27;t believe me).  Thought I would try this product, I think I will switch back to the olive oil.  It&#x27;s cheaper and leaves my skin softer.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I had my doubts about DHC Cleanser, since I have super sensitive skin and nothing seems to agree with it; that is until now.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than three months with no issues.  Actually, my skin looks great!  It balanced my combination skin.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely best cleansing and makeup remover on the market that I have ever tried!!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with all of my DHC products and will continue to purchase them-the cleansing oil is light and effective.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the idea of an oil based cleanser was weird, but this stuff is amazing. I use it as part of a multistep cleaning regimen, and it&#x27;s really helped improve my skins texture and reduced breakouts. Other steps that have been helping are using the Shiseido whipped cleanser before this one, using Mario Badescu with one of those battery powered face scrubbers in the shower, and the Body Shops Vitamin E day cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: Dry, with breakouts caused by dead skin/hormones</li>
            <li> This is the best for removing ANY make-up. It takes me literally less than 3 minutes to clean my face with heavy, water-proof make-up - that&#x27;s counting the time I use a scrub to clean my face afterwards. So you basically put a pump or two in your palm. Rub your hands together, rub the oil on your dry face. I make sure that I rub lots of it over and below my eye-lashes and along my eyeliner. Then you wash it off with warm water, followed by a normal cleanser. I have been using this for over 8 years now and had tried other brands. But this is what I&#x27;m sticking with. My skin feels so clean and moisturized after. I also use it to clean my brushes!</li>
            <li> It does indeed remove your make-up, but so does baby oil and that is a lot less money.....actually so does the main ingredient in this, which is olive oil.....</li>
            <li> It definitely cleans your face the first time and does not leave it oily and it keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li> My favorite product for several years. Removes mineral and waterproof makeup very well. I follow with facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have received free samples of this product in the past and really liked it.  So, I have tried numerous drugstore products and I finally gave up and decided to spend a &amp;#34;little extra&amp;#34; on DGC.  It works much&lt;br /&gt;better than anything I&#x27;ve tried previously, you don&#x27;t use as much, so it really isn&#x27;t any more expensive.  I&#x27;m 65, have &amp;#34;breakout&amp;#34; prone skin, some dryness and this makes my skin feel great.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but I do recommend this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cleanser i have ever tried. my face doesnt feel tight and dry after washing it, and it is the best makeup remover ever!! Great for east coast winters!!</li>
            <li> gets all the make up off...&lt;br /&gt;moisturizes and made my old dry skin look better.&lt;br /&gt;no breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m sold.&lt;br /&gt;the company is super generous with sample. go get you one before you buy.</li>
            <li> I am an avid DHC user. I&#x27;ve used most of the line. I finally tried this deep cleansing oil after I saw an article in one of my magazines about the use of oils as cleansers. I&#x27;ve been using for over a month, and my skin looks great. I am 48 so I have to watch for both wrinkles and breakouts. I have to say that this was the first time I did not have a break out. Leaves skin soft and smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and always wait until DHC puts it on sale to purchase a years supply. Works great aat getting make up off and it feels so nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product through DHC and it is as good as everyone says. Pleasant light fragrance, easy to use, not at all oily or greasy, removes all makeup with one step. So happy to find I could purchase through Amazon and save a few dollars on it!</li>
            <li> You should always follow OIL with SOAP.  People who are getting breakouts aren&#x27;t cleaning with a facial cleanser afterwards.  I have moderate acne (starting to improve with my new skincare cleansing routines!) and this has not agitated or made it worse in the least.  It takes off 100% of my makeup (I wear a LOT of makeup), which is something that my harsh chemical makeup removers never did.  It isn&#x27;t a one-sweep makeup remover however.  For face it takes me one sweep but for eyes it takes two.  If you wear light eye makeup this takes it right off but with heavy mascara (my guilty favorite!) it takes two go arounds.  Overall wonderful product though.  Seems like it will last quite a while.  I will update in a month or so on how my skin is!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product. It really does what it promises to do. Great cleanser without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive, dry skin like me, I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for only 3 days and it has completely dried out my skin. Disappointed... I will have to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year and love the results I get from it.  It cleanses my face and eye make-up thoroughly, with ease, and leaves the face feeling soft and refreshed. I&#x27;ve tried a number of other facial cleansers, but this one is my favorite by far!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few makeup removers in the past but nothing has ever worked to really take most of it off. Every time I would use a makeup remover, I would cleanse and then put on my toner and there would still be quite a bit of makeup on my cotton ball. After reading such good reviews, I decided to splurge and try this product and I truly have no complaints about it. It is a little pricey (in my opinion) and I thought the bottle would be a little bigger considering the price, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product strictly as makeup remover, NOT as my normal cleanser. I wear makeup almost every day because I have a lot of acne scarring/acne that I&#x27;m not comfortable going out with without a full face of foundation/BB cream. I use a separate eye makeup remover first to take off my eyeliner/mascara; then, while my face and hands are dry, I use about 1 and a half pumps of the oil and rub my entire face (avoiding the eye area) for about 20-30 seconds. Then make sure to rinse with water thoroughly to get it all off. After that, I continue on with my normal skincare routine (cleanser, toner, moisturizer, spot treatment, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am someone who wears quite a thick amount of foundation and trust me when I say that this truly removes about 95-100% of it. Occasionally, there will be some trace amounts of my makeup left on the cotton ball when I use toner, but it is significantly better than any other makeup remover I have used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination/oily and relatively sensitive skin and this does not break me out or irritate me at all. It is extremely gentle! If you are someone who wears a good amount of face makeup on a regular basis, I highly recommend you to find a makeup remover that will efficiently take it all off at the end of the day. If you are not cleansing properly and wearing makeup regularly, it WILL lead to break outs and clogged pores. Be sure to find a makeup remover that takes off as much of your makeup as possible. Personally, DHC&#x27;s deep cleansing oil is doing the job for me. I definitely recommend anyone to try it out if they are looking for a great makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Great product, really gets stubborn makeup off</li>
            <li> This face wash is pretty amazing. Also, totally useless if your skin is wet first. That said, if you use it correctly (directly onto dry skin, then rinse with water), it removes EVERYTHING. I wear waterproof eyeliner and a lot of mascara every day and don&#x27;t need to use makeup remover anymore. This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this over regular soaps!  Natural and better for you!!</li>
            <li> I have been using DHC cleansing oil for more than 4 years. The one bought here is different than the ones I have been using for years. I am sure that this one is imitation brand goods!!! Because it has different smell. The worst thing is that it has brown precipitates inside the bottle. And, it is super oily. I need to wash the oil off my face more than 3 times with the facial foam, but the ones I have been using is not that oily and is easily washed off from my face.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy DHC oil online. I bought DHC oil from physical store before, and it is perfect. I like DHC oil, but not the one from here.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy DHC oil here again. I will buy it from physical store instead!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> has replaced the costly she uemura oil for good.  great product.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, emollient oil that doesn&#x27;t leave behind a messy residue and rinses clean with water. Not sure about waterproof mascara but great for foundation, lipstick, sunscreen, et al. You have to remember to apply to a dry face. Massage thoroughly then rinse off with water. As a final step, can be used in conjunction with an additional soapy cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for years!  It is the only thing that takes off all of my make up, including my eye make up!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I have used this product for well over a year now, and I really love it. I rub it in all over my face (before I put any water on my face), especially around my eyes as it is a terrific eye makeup remover. Then I use a washcloth with warm water to rinse. Keeps my skin nice and moist.</li>
            <li> This is my go to product to take off make up. I have never found anything that does such a good job getting all of the make up off without being harsh on your skin. Make sure you get the DHC mild soap to go along with this. You use that to get the remainder of the oil off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleansing oil for several years now. Nothing like it. I wish they sold it by the gallon. It melts away makeup. I have suffered with acne/sensitive skin since high school and use make up to cover up. I have to use this oil otherwise I would probably break out even worse! Great first step to any cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li> A cheaper and just as effective alternative is to use olive oil which is the main ingredient in this product. It&#x27;s not worth the price to buy DHC.</li>
            <li> I really love this item! I have been using it for years and it truly cleans and softens my face.</li>
            <li> Does its job very well. Removes most of my makeup and/or sunscreen with one to two pumps of product. You will need to cleanse your face afterwards, as the instructions indicate. I use CeraVe cleansing wash to rinse the oil and residual makeup after applying this product. The combo works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin - oily with dry patches. I&#x27;m also prone to acne breakouts at 26. I have not experienced any breakouts or clogged pores after using this product. Will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels after cleaning with this cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling stripped dry like shiseido does.</li>
            <li> Really cleans all my make up off</li>
            <li> A must have for my skin. Can&#x27;t go without it. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff is awesome! I apply thing dry with my fingers, massage in then wipe off with a cotton round, then use my philosophy cleanser or purpose and my skin is soft soft. I use this with My BHA and AHA and my skin has never looked so good.</li>
            <li> I heard the hype about this cleansing oil, so I gave it a try. I have to say that this product really gives a deep clean as well as great moisturization. But the product is pricey. There are other great cheap alternatives out there like Garnier. But if you are into pricey, then I would even take it further and get Lancome&#x27;s cleansing oil which is also great. I feel like this product didn&#x27;t live up to the hype because I have found other products that work just as well or even better.</li>
            <li> I love DHC Deep Cleansing Oil.  I use it every night.  It keeps my skin clean and soft--especially good as we head into the harsh winter months!  I am buying a few bottles for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Love it - only oil cleanser I will use!</li>
            <li> its a perfect product to remove make up on skin and also eye make up without hurting my eyes. love it!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I like it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!! I have tried so many other cleansers that make my skin look like I have rubbed it with sandpaper, but when I am done cleaning my skin with this product it looks like I have already put on my skin cream for the night.</li>
            <li> Like other have mentioned I believe this product is faulty or tampered with. I have used this product for years with great results but this product is greasy and smells like rugular cooking olive oil. My face has also broken out but at first thought it may have been other reasons. I now believe it is from this product from Warehouse Deals.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. Goes on greasy, rinses off easily and completely.  Leaves my skin soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I used it once to remove my makeup and I was allergic to it. After I used it, my face turned red, it was like I was blushing. The redness lasted over 48 hours and I finally got a little better. I&#x27;ll never use it again. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. I love this product, it takes off my makeup without stripping it and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li> Great product that does exactly as it says. I have sensitive skin, but with your normal oily T zone. I also wear tubing mascara and all-day shadow which can be hard to remove. One pump of this and some warm water after massaging it in, and nothing is on. Face is clean but not tight with zero residue. This is non-foaming but your skin feels very fresh. This size bottle will last you a few months if you use it once to twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was not interested in trying cleansing oils until I received a sample of this DHC version. I was surprised how well it worked, so I ordered here. I&#x27;m very pleased that I did.</li>
            <li> Best cleansing oil I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It takes all my makeup off and leave the skin soft, does not irritate or dry.</li>
            <li> Great job on cleaning makeup.  First cleanser that did not leave makeup on my towel when drying.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean and smooth.  I will definitely be buying this product from now on.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I was worried this would just contribute to the excess oil, it did the opposite! It removed every last drop of make up off my face, and left my skin feeling very clean. I usually use one pump straight on dry skin, and work it gently for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, and then rinse with warm water. It rinses completely. It leaves the skin feeling very clean, without any oily residue at all. If you try to use this on a wet face it won&#x27;t work, it has to go on dry. Water starts breaking down the product, and it loses its effect. I also noticed that since I&#x27;ve started using this, my skin has not been as oily during the day.</li>
            <li> This works for me. I have oily skin and slightly acne prone and use drug store make up. It takes the make up off really well. The foundation I use is medium coverage but drug store make up generally doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin very good. Like, if someone touched my face I&#x27;d tell them to be careful with what else they touched before they &#x27; washed hands, so with that being said this stuff takes it off very easily. Add well as my eye make up, It comes off easily I just have to rub a bit more but I don&#x27;t have to use more then 3 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;After I use it My face is dry. I wash my face with my normal face wash after.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried with waterproof makeup yet.&lt;br /&gt;Also, yes I&#x27;d you use it on your eyes if for whatever reason you do own your eyes with it still on your eyes your vision will be very blurry....as anything you just rubbed into your eyes would do :/ but it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate your eyes in any way, not even with contacts in.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a about a year - works very well.  Not too oily, Even removes mascara and does not leave an oily residue on your face.</li>
            <li> I only wear long lasting, water proof makeup, as I work 12 to 18 hour shifts routinely. This products gets my face squeakily clean easily, and is nondrying. Love it, recommend it.</li>
            <li> I started wearing waterproof mascara and removing it was always a mess! A friend told me about this product and and it is amazing! Your makeup literally melts and disappears! I&#x27;ll never be without it!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin which has gotten just a few dry patches since I have gotten older (43 years old)  I was hesitant to buy this cleanser because it is made of oil.  I have been trying to keep my face oil free for most of my life!  Having said that, after I read some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  What I have found is that it works very well at breaking down and removing my make up at the end of the day.  It works much better than a soap based cleanser.  It also really seems to help control my oily skin without leaving me with that dried out tight feeling.  Also, a little goes a very long way, which makes the price seem worth it.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> With this, you really need to read the directions on how to use.  Apply it right out of the bottle and massage it into your face.  Then add a little water, which will give it a very slight foaming action, and massage some more, then rinse.  I like the way my face feels after using it - clean to the touch, but not greasy and not dry.  I feel like I get a thorough cleansing with this product.  It also feels like a more natural clean than a lot of other products.  Takes off the foundation and the eyeshadow just fine.  I only wear makeup once or twice a week, and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li> High grade oil cleanser.  Is famous for taking off make-up so well, and I find it more effective than super high-end products like Laura Mercier and Shiseido.  Most reviews are good but some are terrible.  Why?  Either #1 - they have super, super oily acne-prone skin and/or #2 - they&#x27;re using it wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY IMPORTANT TIPS TO FOLLOW -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLY DRY - do not wet your hands or your face.  massage into face up to thirty seconds ONLY; if you do it too long it can make you break out!!!!!!!!!! This is where a lot of people make a mistake and think the product is bad.  Thirty seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE ANOTHER CLEANSER AFTER - another mistake people make.  you&#x27;re sort-of supposed to use a different cleanser after this to counterbalance the extreme oiliness.  so it&#x27;s basically DHC &gt; cleanser &gt; toner &gt; moisturizer.  This is mostly only a night cleanser because of how deep it cleans and takes off your make-up, but some people get away with using this as their only cleanser.  It depends on how prone you are to break-outs and how much $$ you want to spend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE PUMP - you just need one pump. don&#x27;t use any more than that or you&#x27;ll break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TAKES OFF ALL YOUR MAKE-UP - this basically will take off everything, even waterproof eye make-up.  However, it can make your vision oddly blurry, which freaked me out at first.  This also makes my eyes sting a little bit, unfortunately.  But not for everyone.  I prefer to use [[ASIN:B000EGKADW Lancome BI-FACIL Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover  (125ml)  4.2 Fluid Ounces]] for my eyes then use DHC for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!!! I have normal skin and use every night.  It feels like such a deep clean and I love the feeling it gives my skin.  Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I honestly don&#x27;t smell anything.  Maybe a little bit like olive oil...?  But not really.  I don&#x27;t notice.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Odorless, mild, yet melts away make-up including waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I wipe it off with a warm wet cloth.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin clean,soft, and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;A bottle lasts me 9 months using it once a day in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleansing oil and the best I have ever used. It easily removes my make up and leaves my skin smooth not oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for six years.  My daughters will use nothing else.  Two pumps is all you will need to remove all of your eye make up and your face make up.  You apply it to a dry face and rinse all of it off with warm water. Though you don&#x27;t have to, I use a wash cloth to stimulate my skin as I rinse it off.  Then I follow with a mild face wash and a good moisturizer.  I wear contacts and I do take them out before I apply the oil though.  This product is wonderful.  I have recommended it over and over for years and have converted many to the idea of putting oil on their face.  But the real surprise is how fast this will remove all of your make up.  And I do mean all.  No pulling on your delicate eye area, no wiping over and over to get rid of the raccoon in the mirror.  My face feels great, I have never experienced any break outs from this product and I love how quickly it works.</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on for years and I love it in the winter.  But it&#x27;s just okay.  I&#x27;ve also used the garnier cleansing oil and I actually like it better, for a fraction of the cost.  It seems to be better hydrating than this one.  The one thing I do love about this product is there isn&#x27;t any crap chemicals in it. It does not have mineral oil either, which I love.  It does cleanse well and takes off makeup well.</li>
            <li> Best cleansing oil and face &amp; eye makeup remover. I wear light eye makeup so it works fine. I think it is comparable to Lancome eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It was shipped so fast from Korea! I am so impressed to see the product is authentic and it comes with some few sample products! I will order more from this shop. Next time I will more than one thing ! Really really love this shop!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, delicate, long lasting bottle of the most thorough, gentle cleanser ever.  It completely removes mascara and makeup, it completely rinses away. More expensive than a bar of soap, and much more long lasting, too.</li>
            <li> This is just my experience that I wanted to share, everyone is different (especially when it comes to skin). All you can really do is try it for yourself :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to try this cleansing oil, I&#x27;d heard a lot of great things about it. Being a huge proponent for organic and natural living, I love the idea of not cleaning my skin with bubbles, namely sodium laurel sulfates and petroleum derived petrochemicals, fragrances, and parabens. The idea of washing my face the way Cleopatra and the ancient Egyptians did appealed to me. Slathering oil onto my face just felt right, like this is how washing your face is supposed to feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this cleansing oil 2.5 weeks, then couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I followed the directions completely, rubbing it onto dry skin and rinsing thoroughly. I loved the way it felt on my face, and I could feel the debris it was pulling out of my pores. By the end of the facial cleanse, it was like the oil had turned into an exfoliating scrub because it had pulled out so much gunk that the oil turned grainy. It was like all that nastiness you see on a Biore strip after you peel it from your nose but in your hands from rubbing the oil. It was amazing and made my skin feel so clean and soft. But then, after a few days of using the oil, I developed the largest, most painful cystic acne breakout I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I have oily skin with slight to moderate hormonal acne, but had never experienced a breakout quite like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give up on the oil right away, instead I thought of what could be causing it. Surely, it can&#x27;t be the oil clogging my pores and causing the breakouts because it&#x27;s all rinsed away cleanly, right? So I thought maybe because its deep cleaning my pores so well, the grime and bacteria from my makeup brushes (foundation, powder, concealer, blush, blenders, eye brushes, brow brushes, etc.) were getting in and causing the horrific breakout. I cleaned all my brushes very thoroughly and kept on top of cleaning them every week, but this didn&#x27;t make the cystic acne stop. After dealing with the pain and unsightly acne for 2.5 weeks with no relief in sight, I gave up on the oil. The breakouts subsided and I&#x27;m just now getting back to my pre-oil skin (it&#x27;s been almost 2 months since I stopped). I have a few large, dark acne scars around my chin that are still there and will take a few more months to completely heal and fade away. The breakouts were pretty much all over face: my chin, a bit on my cheeks, along each side of my nose, all over my upper lip and a few on my forehead. It was the worst, most concentrated around my chin and upper lip, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because it really does deep clean and made my skin feel great after using it (especially compared to regular facial cleansers) minus the cysts of course. I have about 2/3 of the bottle left, and maybe if I learn something new about why I broke out so badly I&#x27;ll try it again someday.n top of cleaning them every week, but this didn&#x27;t make the cystic acne stop.

            <li> Just wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive. Very soothing after peels and retin A. I will buy this always . Excellent product</li>
            <li> really good, I am using it on a day-to-day basis now.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to use your own facial cleanser after this.</li>
            <li> The best cleanser. If you use this once, you will never use anything else. And, no, it does not make your skin oily. I wondered too until I tried it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love washing my face with this product.  Does remove make-up well. No over drying.</li>
            <li> I was recently sent a sample of this product and finally decided to try it. I&#x27;m used to using a makeup-dissolving oil on my face before washing at night. The product I had been using would leave a slight residue on my face which is why I felt it necessary to wash after. I would also have to soak cotton pads and leave them over my eyes for about 15-20 seconds before attempting to remove my eye makeup so that it could break down my mascara...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not with this stuff!! I put a little on my hands, emulsified it between my fingers and started applying it directly to my face and my many layers of makeup just melted away. Even when I got to my eyes, I just gently massaged  and I could feel my mascara falling apart. After rinsing this oil away I was shocked at how clean my skin was. I&#x27;m used to having a little leftover mascara smudging beneath my lower lashes, but there was nothing! And I did not have an oily residue at all. I just finished off with a toner and my once lengthy makeup-removal routine was shortened by more than half the time! My skin feels so incredible, and I&#x27;m definitely going to start buying this product regularly. A must-have for ladies (and gents) who wear a classic pancake makeup face.</li>
            <li> Amazing! this cleansing oil i bought it after read a lot of reviews, and people compared it with shu uemura quality which is a big and well know brand from Japan although I haven&#x27;t try that one I can swear by this one! is amazing! it takes off all your make up just with a lil massage and then when you apply water the oily texture disappear, turning in a white liquid texture then you just wash it out with more water and your are done! also let your skin smooth and so clean! I bought mine on last July and I still have a little, Using it only at night you can make it last around 4 or 5 months, of course that will depend of the quantity of product you use, I use the amount that comes out when pushing the button of the bottle, I totally recomend it! I already repurchase 2 bottles more, is one of my favorite products of my skin care routine :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this help!</li>
            <li> I like how this removes eye makeup as well as everything else in one step.  I find it a bit drying though for my 50+ year old skin.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample in the mail and tried it and loved it! All of DHC products are great! I wear a lot of mascara and this gets it all off so easily and all the rest of my makeup so nicely! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily at all. Just leaves it very soft. I&#x27;ve learned that you put in on dry skin and then rinse it off with water. It becomes milky when water hits it so you know when it&#x27;s all rinsed off and it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes at all.</li>
            <li> I broke out with pimples from this product even after rinsing it entirely off after application with a wet cloth. Sensitive skin types should use with caution.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  If doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all, as one might expect.  It washes off very easily with water, leaving the skin feeling so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I have used many cleansing oils and I like this one the best.  Easy to use and it was delivered on a timely basis</li>
            <li> great product, not so great service</li>
            <li> This takes off all makeup.  After cleaning with a cleanser, face is soft and smooth. I also noticed I do not have as many breakouts as I used to before trying this product.  Highly recommend using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to oil cleansers and have tried this and Murad.  I like them both but I think this product cleanses a bit more thoroughly while still remaining gentle.</li>
            <li> This is a great face cleanser.  Gets all of your make-up off the first time without leaving your face feeling greasy.  Absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Takes off my makeup like no other product.</li>
            <li> Love this oil cleanser.  It is a great wash for dry/mature skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The best to clean your makeup off and leave skin NOT feeling dry.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Deeps cleans. Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is a product I absolutely can&#x27;t do without!  I have tried many other makeup removers but nothing works better, I would definitely recommend this product !!</li>
            <li> I think this is the best oil-type cleanser out there. It&#x27;s very thorough, removes all traces of makeup, rinses cleanly, &amp; leaves skin feeling clean and soft. Can also be used as part of regular skin cleaning routine.&lt;br /&gt;First you massage onto DRY skin &amp; wait for a few seconds then rinse with water &amp; voila! skin is clean with no traces of dirt/sebum/makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is olive-oil based, if it is left too long or used in excess it might dry skin a bit when rinsed (remember this is a cleanser not a moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients (as listed on the box I got):&lt;br /&gt;olea europaea (olive fruit oil), caprylic/capric triglyceride, sorbeth-30 tetraoleate, pentylene glycol, phenoxyethanol, tocopherol, stearyl glycyrrhetinate,rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;Made in Japan, expires after 6 months from opening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, excellent cleansing oil, well-packaged, delivered on time. Would definitely consider ordering again.</li>
            <li> Can remove make-up clearly.  Easy to remove eye make up.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels exactly like the olive oil you find in your kitchen. I like to use a lot of this product each time because I don&#x27;t like the feeling of tugging my skin when it&#x27;s not slippery enough. I also noticed that when I massage my face with this for a minute or two, tiny blackheads come right out. It even gets annoying because I end up feeling like I&#x27;m exfoliating my face with those things (gross I know). When I wash it off, the oil turns milky and my face is soooo soft. Pores have been cleared out (although I notice it doesn&#x27;t work for blackheads on the nose, but it does draw it out just enough that the nose feels rough, like it&#x27;s trying to come out but not completely). I don&#x27;t use makeup often but I love using this at the end of the day; it just makes my pores feel cleaned, and my face gets soft and smooth every time. Only con is that I feel like it runs out quickly. Two or three pumps of this and you notice a difference in the amount of oil left in the bottle. Worth the price, though.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cleanser.  It completely removes all of my makeup including all waterproof eye makeup.  It does not leave a greasy film on my face, and it does not have a scent. Also, I do not feel that it is necessary to wash my face after using this.  My only gripe is that is makes my eyes a bit foggy for a minute or two after using.  I mainly use this because it removes eye makeup so effectively, so that is kind of a bummer.  If you have dry skin this may be too drying for you, but it works very well on combination to oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a no frills product, but it does its job well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a learner of make-up. It&#x27;s important to have a deep facial cleanser to protect my skin. After using DHC cleanser together with other moisture product, my skin is in good condition. Love it so much!</li>
            <li> I love the soft feel of my skin afterwards, I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using DHC Deep Cleansing Oil for several years. It is very good at removing mascara and washing my face at the same time. It does not leave an oily residue. I like the fact that it is made from refined olive oil.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It leaves my otherwise dull gray looking skin so clean and glowing after using it. The oil gives me the needed moisture to keep my skin looking fresh and young.  The product is simply GREAT.  It seems to have minimal ingredients (which I like), does what it is intended to do, &amp; more.  I have been struggling to find products to help with my delicate aging skin.  This seems to cleanse, moisturize, and lift/remove toxins (?) - not sure what it is but after I use it, my husband always tells me that my skin looks nice.  After using it for a week, I have notice my skin overall is smoother with fewer dry bumps/blemishes.  That I have a glow and not gray to it.  It even has helped minimize the amount of blackheads and ingrowns that I previously had/would have.  I highly recommend this product.  I will be purchasing it until I die or until it goes off the market.</li>
            <li> awesome but had to stop using because it broke me out severely, I have very very acne prone skin and was attempting other things besides proactive but had to go back to proactive, I wish my face was less sensitive</li>
            <li> I used to over wash by double cleansing witth my face wash but this is fantastic for a first go makeup remover. Dont let the gentleness  or the oil fool you, its amazing at removing every last bit of makeup- sticky foundation, mascaras and every other strange thing we can put on our face. It turns to a milky cleanser when water is applied. I follow it up with my usual face wash to get extra clean skin. I would buy it again. Its similar to the precleanse in the dermalogica system.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My face feels clean (which is odd since this is oil). It has also helped my &amp;#34;way too old to be getting&amp;#34; acne!</li>
            <li> This takes off my foundation and eye makeup all at once. It saves me time and does not dry out my skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! it is a one stop shop for cleansing, moisturizing and keeping your skin youthful looking. I am so impressed by how it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your face, it simply washes off with plain water... Amazing!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to remove sunscreen and makeup and thought I would give this a try because of all the positive reviews...BIG mistake. Although, the product did remove every trace of makeup I found that every night after I used this, my skin felt very dry and dehydrated. This struck me as a little odd as I have very very oily skin. This cleansing oil didn&#x27;t break me out immediately, but after religious use for about 3 weeks, I broke out in a pimp on my cheek from it :( This was disappointing because I wanted to like this after hearing other peoples great reviews. I mainly purchased this because I use the Proactiv system (which I love, I hadn&#x27;t broken out in a single pimple for years...until using this) because it wasn&#x27;t designed to remove makeup and the idea of using another cleanser to remove makeup sounded to harsh. Alternatives I recommend to remove makeup with are: the Original Neutrogena Make-up Remover Cleansing Towelettes or the Proactiv Makeup Removing Towelettes, which I use to remove face makeup/suncreen (regardless of if it&#x27;s waterproof or not, and for waterproof mascara/eye makeup Lancome Bi-Facil or Clinique Take The Day Off.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the clinique cleansing oil was out of stock. It was very comparable and slightly cheaper. Clinque is clear and this is an olive oil color and smell. I think it takes off foundation very well and think it would work well for all kinds of skin. This wash has not caused me any breakouts.I would recommend it for mature skin also since you are not pulling on your skin during washing. Even though it is a cleansing oil I don&#x27;t think it is moisturizing and I do put face cream on after washing</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE A STAR... BUT IS NOT THE PRODUCT NAME IS THE SELLER....&lt;br /&gt;I have been using DHC Deep Cleansing Oil for a while now, but back in March I decided to order it from this particular seller.  Did not even open the product until the end of May 2012 because I still had a lot left from my other bottles. So once I finished my previous bottles while I was on vacation I started using my new one from this seller.  I started getting this really bad allergic reaction....I thought....but then it turned into almost acne sort of..... I didn&#x27;t even think it was this product that was causing my skin problem. I got back from vacation and stop using anything on my skin because I had a lot of acne.... well thats what i thought it was.  Its been 2 months since I last used that product and my skin still is not back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;Today I noticed I had some cleanser left on my old bottle and NOTICED SOMETHING  VERY STRANGE..... my original cleanser that I HAVE BEEN USING FOR YEARS ITS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND THE COLOR OF THE CLEANSER IS DIFFERENT AS WELL.&lt;br /&gt;THIS CLEANSER BY THIS SELLER IS DARKER AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE IT HAS SOME DARK RESIDUE OF SOME SORT....&lt;br /&gt;while my original one has ABSOLUTELY NO RESIDUE ITS A NICE YELLOW TONE TO IT AND THINER THAN THE ONE FROM THIS SELLER.  I&#x27;M GOING TO START AN INVESTIGATION ABOUT THIS SELLER AND FILE A COMPLAINT AND PERSUE WHATEVER I NEED TO PERSUE, BECAUSE MY SKIN STILL IS VERY DAMAGE AND NOTHING HAS BEEN ABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM I NEVER USED TO HAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Been using this great product for years...it&#x27;s just about the only thing that makes my 70 year old face feel young!  so happy it&#x27;s now available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly. All good!</li>
            <li> I like the way this product leaves my skin soft and dewy looking. I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a few weeks and deeper lines are less noticeable. The initial feel of oil on my face is a bit disconcerting, but the oil really washes off with water.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. I like that it cleans off every concealer on my face. It doesn&#x27;t give me breakout/dryness. Overall it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I recommend using steam/hot water and a washcloth to really remove it. It makes your skin feel amazing and hel</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever stop using this.  As a 50 year old female with eczema and irish sensitive skin, this feels glorious and gets off every bit of my full-face everyday makeup! I follow it up with a DHC cleanser and their amazing nighttime extra moisturizer. Nothing like Asian skincare - but DHC is truly the best. It&#x27;s worth every penny and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Always use the cleansing oil to remove sunscreen and BB cream. It works quite well :-)</li>
            <li> This is the best Cleansing oil. I love it. It is very gentle for my face but clean very well.</li>
            <li> this is fake stuff....don&#x27;t buy it...</li>
            <li> I really love this cleanser, it&#x27;s great. Does not leave an oil feel to your face at all. Perfect</li>
            <li> Very effective in cleansing my face and is gentle enough for daily use. Price is right too!</li>
            <li> This is a staple for me and I always have it on hand, but I don&#x27;t use it as my everyday cleanser.  I have in the past with adequate success and I would definitely recommend it. I use it now when I need to take eye makeup off or am in a hurry to cleanse at night and don&#x27;t want to go through my whole routine.  I also keep it by my sink and use one single drop to wash my hands after putting on BB cream or make-up that applies better by hand/fingertips than brush.  It&#x27;s really great for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason I really recommend it is because it&#x27;s so gentles and doesn&#x27;t break out or irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it takes off every bit of makeup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of cleansers over the years, high end and drug store alike and I always come back to this. You have to remember to pump this into the palm of your hands, rub palms together, and massage into DRY face. Massage the oil into your skin, this includes eye makeup too, then rinse gently with washcloth and warm water. My skin feels clean and soft afterward and NO oily residue.</li>
            <li> the same as i bought before. price is not very high.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser hands down.. Face feels fresh and clean. Removed all traces of makeup with no residue. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it really does remove makeup and mascara (of any genre)!  But I&#x27;m not sure about its ingredients and am wondering if it might contain some thing that I may not want to put on my skin.  It&#x27;s not manufactured in the USA, so that&#x27;s why I&lt;br /&gt;wonder about things like this.  At the rate I&#x27;m using it, I&#x27;m also not sure how long it will last.  I usually don&#x27;t pay almost $30/mo. for something to cleanse my face!  I simply need to get more info about the product&#x27;s ingredients to find out if I want to continue using it.If I find out that it has acceptable ingredients and it lasts 2 months, I may continue paying $15/mo for it!</li>
            <li> I got this initially as a sample from a purchase on Dermstore.com. The oiliness takes a little getting used to, but it works so well for daily use. I switch between this and the Phisoderm acne wash, if I&#x27;m feeling a breakout coming on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combo dry/oily + sensitive skin and don&#x27;t wear makeup generally. I use it as a basic, daily cleanse. This product leaves it feeling clean and moist without any irritation or over-drying &amp;#34;squeakiness&amp;#34;. Like another reviewer said, just pump (I use one pump), rub between your hands to heat up the oil, then massage it into your skin and rinse well. From here, I continue on with my regiment of DAY: Skin Cueticals CE Ferulic with Kinara weightless moisturizer and NIGHT: Kinara Lactic Acid, Kinara Peptide Serum, and Decleor Aroma White C (or Kinara nighttime moisturizer, if I want a heavier dose of moisturizer).</li>
            <li> This product excels as a first step in facial cleanser.  It goes on dry, loosens and removes makeup, rinses off perfectly; best eye makeup remover; I follow up with facial soap.  My skin feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> dhc is the best of olive oil cleansers.  deep cleaning as well as soothing toning.  i would not be without dhc cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  My gf loves it so it&#x27;s an easy win for me.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Blocked my pore more than unblocked them.  I still use it occasionally, like when I run out of my preferred cleanser, dermalogica.</li>
            <li> Best make up remover ever! It removes make up like magic. I recommend this to anyone. I will buy this again and again</li>
            <li> Like everyone else I&#x27;m pretty well amazed and pretty well impressed by this product.  I, too, was skeptical about using oil to cleanse my breakout-prone skin, but not to worry.  It works like a dream, foams up a little with the application of water, rinses away clean, and leaves my skin so soft and clean that it feels wonderful.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this; I&#x27;m a believer now, too.</li>
            <li> This oil feels great on your face. It melts ALL your makeup off. I was afraid of oil in the sink but it truly is water soluable. It rinses off with ease and leaves your face silky smooth. A little pricy, but it should last for quite some time. Like the pump, just two quick squirts is all you need.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, rinse right off. Remove my makeup too. Feel clean and not dry. This has been popular for a reason.</li>
            <li> Wonderful on your skin.  Just LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This removes my stubborn eye makeup without irritating my eyes. It&#x27;s a lot more pleasant for me to use than most makeup removers and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. Follow this up with an other cleanser as this really meant to remove makeup and daily grime.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to put any type of oil on my acne-prone face, but my dermatologist recommended a facial cleansing oil to remove make up before washing my face. This product is now a permanent part of my skin care routine. Note: apply with DRY hands to DRY skin, then rinse off and was face as usual.</li>
            <li> Really a great product and an amazing deal. DHC PRODUCTS ARE REALLY AWESOME. I am new to DHC line, but every product w DHC WAS TRULY GREAT.</li>
            <li> Was hesisant about an oil that could clean and moisturizer without leaving my face greasy. it doesn&#x27;t?! Just wonderful, light, soft.. Make a difference in my skin visibly!</li>
            <li> I have super oily and sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m half Korean and my Korean relatives have been using oil cleansers for years since they believe that makeup remover cloths are too abrasive.  They also look about 20 years younger than their age.  I was too scared to try it though because it seemed counter-intuitive for an oily person like me to put more oil on my skin!  I&#x27;m so happy I did!  My Korean aunts told me to make sure to give myself a nice massage when taking off my makeup.  I put the oil onto my dry hands and face and concentrate on massaging my cheek bones and jawline in an upward motion.  We all deserve a little pampering!  Then I add water, massage a little more and then rinse it off and have ZERO traces of makeup left.  Due to my sensitive skin and history of breakouts I then follow with Cetaphil and my Clarisonic brush (which stays white since there&#x27;s no makeup left on my face!).  I so look forward to using this every night!  My skin is moisturized, healthier looking, and the little massage each night has improved the appearance of the skin around my cheeks.</li>
            <li> it can not clean very good&lt;br /&gt;it make me skin not good&lt;br /&gt;i dislike this&lt;br /&gt;it bad for me .</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. Have tried many others, but I always come back to this one - it even gently removes water-proof makeup! It works the best and the price is pretty good. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> used it for several years..no complain</li>
            <li> This cleaner works well if you use a very small amount, as it is an oil.  Cleans well, and does not leave your skin feeling dry, and drawn.</li>
            <li> Really works well to help problem areas of dry skin around my nose.  I have tried countless cleansers over the years &amp; this one is the best!</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup remover cleanser hands down and I&#x27;ve tried a lot! I wear foundation everyday and wouldn&#x27;t be without this. No cleanser removes makeup better than an oil based cleanser for those who&#x27;ve never tried. Don&#x27;t be afraid even if you have oily or problematic skin. I do and I believe this has actually improved my skin. I suffered from acne for a long time. My skin is better now and this is all I use. I use at night to remove makeup. Then exfoliate with a microfiber cloth to remove any makeup left over and then after showering I use this again to wash away any residue. I then use it to wash my clean face again in the morning. That&#x27;s it. No additional cleanser needed and I find my oil production is more balanced because other cleansers especially foaming ones dry out your skin. Only downside is it&#x27;s hard to find. Amazon is only retailer that seems to stock it consistently.</li>
            <li> This oil is great! It cleans the skin without drying it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Gets off all dirt and makeup easily and leaves skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell but it works really to remove make up . I&#x27;m not sure about heavy makeup , since I only use bb cream and it works really well to remove that.</li>
            <li> it does not wash off the waterproof eye make up.</li>
            <li> Takes makeup off extremely well. I&#x27;ve been using this followed by a toner every night for about two weeks now and my skin is looking better than it has in quite some time.</li>
            <li> The perfect makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I use this to take off my makeup every night. It leaves my face feeling more moisturized afterward than regular facewash. I have oily, somewhat acne-prone skin and this does not increase my issues in any way. Also - I use a white towel to dry my face and there is never any leftover makeup residue.</li>
            <li> I like this, it is quite good replacement from Shu Uemura.&lt;br /&gt;Its gentle enough and clean make up very well.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Shu Uemura smell but, as long as they work the same at least to remove make up well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it was soooo good, so I decided to re-purchase, when the product arrived I realized that it looked slightly different it was also packaged a bit different.</li>
            <li> So soothing and thorough cleansing.  No artificial ingredients. Great for all skins.</li>
            <li> Feels so good as you massage it into your skin, then wipes away easily with warm washcloth leaving skin soft as can be!  A great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older but still had the occasional breakout -- typical combination skin.  Once I started using this the breakouts stopped.  Frankly, nothing removes makeup better.  My skin is soft and fresh afterwards and NOT tight, oily or irritated.  Just follow the directions -- massage in with dry hands on a dry face.  A little goes a long way making this less costly than a lot of less expensive cleansers.</li>
            <li> Use this every day to remove makeup. Works great</li>
            <li> The best.  One pump will take off all of your makeup.  Apply directly to face (don&#x27;t add water until you have massaged it thoroughly into your face).  Then rinse with warm water.  This size should last at least 6 months with daily use.</li>
            <li> I have never enjoyed washing my face so much! It&#x27;s the cleanest and softest my skin has ever felt.</li>
            <li> I use DHC cleansing oil daily as part of my daily skin cleaning routine along with Skingenixx Exfoliating Face Cleasner [[ASIN:B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]] and Moisturizer [[ASIN:B00VSCKY1E Skingenixx Hyaluronic Acid Facial Moisturizer.]]. I have been doing this routine twice daily for the last year - my skin looks fantastic – wrinkles are diminishing and skin tone is much more even and bright. Also, no clogged pores or blackheads – firmer and tighter face. Give these a try, they really work great, I couldn’t be happier.</li>
            <li> Exellent! High quality!</li>
            <li> Perfect.. This is first time in DHC. I will use again it..</li>
            <li> My facial skin type- combination; big pores; acne prone; hardly use makeup;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only oil cleanser. Leaves skin very clean without drying much. Feels like material for pump changed(?)-- no longer opaque, slightly translucent. Doesn&#x27;t leave a filmsy feeling after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I have tried other cleansing oils but never found one I liked better.  My skin gets very clean and hydrated.  I have sensitive skin and I do not breakout.  Give this product a try, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> Removes make up, grime and leaves skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This has been  my favorite cleanser for a decade now. Love it! Didn&#x27;t know it was located in Japan but the shipping was free and lightning fast! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> I Love this product! It emulsifies and washing all my makeup off with ease and the price can not be beat.</li>
            <li> Excellent for gentle, yet thorough makeup removal. Product shipped fast and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Ok...I&#x27;m old.  I I have used a million products on my face.  In addition to having fair, sensitive skin, I have wrinkles and large pores.  This was my first time using an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; product after doing some research.  I...love...it.  Not only did it leave my pores squeeky clean (I have used masks, pore cleansers, nose strips that were just &amp;#34;o.k.&amp;#34;), but it melted off my waterproof mascara and gel liner like melted butter.  Amazing.  Now, as far as it being an oil (olive oil based), it rinsed off thoroughly and quickly with just plain water.  At night, I usually use a toner just to make sure all the makeup and anything else is completely washed off before using a moisturizer.  Also, this is a good sized bottle and it does not take much to cleanse the whole face and neck.  Will definitely buy again.  Price of the DHC product is quite good, especially compared to Korean/Japanese products.  EDIT***** Just watched Korean show.  The kids on this show used a foaming cleanser after removing their makeup with the oil, followed by a toner.</li>
            <li> Since I picked this up in Japan last year I haven&#x27;t used anything else as a cleanser. I will continue to repurchase this product!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!  This is the first skin care product that my 20 y. o. son has enthusiastically used every day and he is so happy with the improvement in his acne and overall complexion.  And I love it for my dryness and wrinkles.  Worth the cost!  ;)</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder.  I really like the way this cleans off all the makeup and rinses right off.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My eyes are very sensitive to eye makeup remover, but this product not only takes it all off but doesn&#x27;t sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product and use is daily.</li>
            <li> This product is great, has solved my dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a while several years ago, and I have tried others. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for cleansing thoroughly without drying. Save some time and effort, and just choose this one. There are no good imitators.</li>
            <li> AMAZING .... works like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried  :-)  Removes all make up and leaves your skin silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Gets makeup off quickly and totally!</li>
            <li> I want to love this but I&#x27;ve used Shu Uemura&#x27;s cleansing oils and those are amazing.  This I like because it gets the job done at a fraction of the price but it doesn&#x27;t feel like a treat.  Oh well.  It feels and sort of smells like mostly olive oil, but olive oil doesn&#x27;t emulsify like this does.  That&#x27;s what makes it so much more effective at removing makeup.  Doesn&#x27;t break my skin out or strip it and it always feels soft after.  It has become a staple in my routine and I have bought multiple bottles.  Probably been using it close to two years and I will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works great to get off make up!</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for removing makeup</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser, melts away all makeup.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Nothing takes eye makeup off like it</li>
            <li> Gets makeup off well. ... like this product. ..will buy again. .</li>
            <li> After having my fair share with cleansing oils this one is the final winner. I have dry skin. I put on makeup everyday and this oil melts everything off even the waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked so well for me! It&#x27;s not meant for removing eye makeup, but I use it for that, as well as my entire face. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. This bottle will probably last me for a year or more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been use DHC deep cleansing oil for over 4 years now, I love it! good for clean makeup, heavy sun block! anti-clotting pores!</li>
            <li> Great stuff .... use it every night.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, the color is darker than it should be, it feels &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;, and it doesn&#x27;t wash off very cleanly. I&#x27;ve purchased the original before, and the one I received looks and feels quite different. The bottle is the same though.</li>
            <li> Absolutely will always have this product in my arsenal of products to have on hand. I use it everyday and Im in awe how good it cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out or leave it oily! Will continue to buy this product for years to come!!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is working great on my &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  It takes off all traces of make-up including waterproof mascara.  Many people have reservations about using an oil and I cannot think of enough ways to reassure them!  I have combination skin that occasionally breaks out even though I&#x27;m in my late twenties (sigh).  This product washes away cleanly leaving no trace of oil or make-up.  It doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out and my skin feels freshly scrubbed - NO left over oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I have ever used.  My skin feels soft and clean but not stripped of moisture after usage.</li>
            <li> I love using this cleanser with my favorite cleaning brush it really digs deep into the skin and I feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Who would ever think cleaning ones face with olive oil would work??  Well, it does and my skin has never looked better.  My complexion feels so clean and smooth.  This cleanser is awesome.  It also has a nice clean scent.  I have skin on the drier side, but not too much.  On a scale o 1 - 10 mine would likely be a 7.5 - this DHC cleansing oil cleans the dirt and makeup off easily and quickly.  The benefit is my skin feels velvety soft.  This product is certainly a 10!  I will continue to purchase this for sure!  I never knew a cleanser could make such a positive difference.</li>
            <li> I used some cleansing before,but this one is my favorite...I prefer cleansing made up of oil.Sincerely,i recommend this one to everyone who wants to have her up removal well-done.</li>
            <li> Awesome cleanser, the only small drawback is that it stings a little in the eyes, but I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product. I gave it a few weeks of consistent use, but my face broke out worse than I think I&#x27;ve ever experienced. After I did more research I found that many (MANY) people don&#x27;t do well with olive oil based cleansing. I suppose I fall into that category of many. I ended up throwing it away, going to get a facial as a reset for my face and made my own blend of castor and sesame oils. My face is finally on the mend.</li>
            <li> I AM ENJOYING THIS PRODUCT, WORKS WELL AND REMOVES MAKEUP IT&#x27;S GREAT FOR A FACIAL MASSAGE.</li>
            <li> I have done a homemade olive oil and caster oil face cleanser for sometime but was never in love with it.  After trying a sample of DHC I knew that this product fixed my concerns with the homemade stuff.  It&#x27;s much easier to rinse than the at home cleanser but does just as good a job at removing my make up and cleaning my skin.  I have psoriasis so I&#x27;m always a little concerned when trying new store bought cleansers. I have had no adverse reactions to this product.  I can even tell when I&#x27;ve gotten lazy and not used it for a few days.  It rinses clean yet I find that I don&#x27;t need nearly as much moisturizer as with previous cleansers.  Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Its a great, gentle cleanser that really takes off the toughest sunscreen and makeup.</li>
            <li> Very good cleanser. Completely cleans your face and leaves no trace of makeup. I like the fact that it is so simple to use.</li>
            <li> This is truly my first review on Amazon. This product is amazing! It gets rid of all the makeup and grime of the day. My skin glows and my age spots are practically gone. I typically have oily skin and was concerned it would be too much...it&#x27;s not! Try this product...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have found to clean my face.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product works so well and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin. I would recommend it to older women - well, anyone.</li>
    </ol>
