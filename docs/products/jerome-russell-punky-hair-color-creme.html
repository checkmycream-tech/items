            <li>lol!!</li>
            <li>Color came out the way it should, smells delicious</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting my hair that perfect platinum color</li>
            <li>BEAUTIFUL shade!</li>
            <li>:D</li>
            <li>It works awesome.  </li>
            <li>Bought the &amp;#34;platinum blonde&amp;#34;, and worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase, planning to keep using as part of my color routine to keep the color popping each month.</li>
            <li>This is the best temporary toner I have used.</li>
            <li>Perfect!!!</li>
            <li>The grape smell is very pleasant though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product!</li>
            <li>and I was a happy customer until a week passed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s semi permanent which is why it&#x27;s great if your hair, like mine, is fried</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>My hair did have a nice purple tinge for a couple of days- but a very good conditioner and toner.  </li>
            <li>Not that it matters, but it smells oddly good too.</li>
            <li>Smells really good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results (Amber Rose, eat your heart out!)</li>
            <li>Loved the color.</li>
            <li>It also smells so good, and leaves hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Not so good wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li>I give this 2 stars because it&#x27;s not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>have a good experience.</li>
            <li>This product is great and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>instead I got an interesting shade of lavender, which is great if that was what I wanted...</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>Helped me tone my hair amazingly.</li>
            <li>This toner turns your hair a wonderful shade of purple and then fades with everyday washing to a perfect platinum.</li>
            <li>but I have my own solution that I use.</li>
            <li>I ended up just using a purple shampoo, surprisingly that worked much better than anything else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to use hair products that don&#x27;t smell all chemical-y.</li>
            <li>Decided to try this toner because it was a good price and had okay reviews...</li>
            <li>But I prefer to mix my own toner,</li>
            <li>and I got amazing results :)</li>
            <li>This is a good, cheap toner.</li>
            <li>But I will say this product is better than Manic Panic I used.</li>
            <li>:) FIVE STARS</li>
            <li>but I personally love the effect.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>But if your hair is too yellow or orange, this product will not be your best companion.</li>
            <li>And it smells like grape medicine, but I love that smell.</li>
            <li>For the price it should be better.</li>
            <li>I love punky color but it would have been better to buy two.</li>
            <li>Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li>Better toners exist.</li>
            <li>I started from the bottom part of my hair worked it all to the top.</li>
            <li>If you have more hair you are going to need more than one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>But I have better results, faster from using Wella Color Charm T18 &amp; a 20% developer.</li>
            <li>I like this brand better than the Manic Panic, but mostly because I think it smells better &amp;</li>
            <li>the price is slightly better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if your hair is already very very light blonde that it would make it that beautiful lavender silver colour, but if you have any orangey/brassy colours in your hair, you&#x27;re kinda out of luck.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and mild on your hair and scalp</li>
            <li>I love punky color, always strong and to the point.</li>
            <li>The smell of the dye is pleasant, the amount is plentiful, and the result was a perfect translucent light lavender almost silver hue which I can tell will fade beautifully over the next few days.</li>
            <li>It just left a very good scent on my hair but did not take out the brassyness of it.</li>
            <li>It was an interesting look, and fortunately, it does wash out over time.</li>
            <li>Good product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I can easily say I wont be buying this again.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>However it washes out quite quickly, hence you would need to buy more to mantain the colour every now and then</li>
            <li>The best thing about it is that there is no brassiness to my hair when I use this product and my hair is very dark brown.</li>
            <li>The problem with this hair toner is that it is too light to stick in the hair and cause any changes.</li>
            <li>I put it on my daughter&#x27;s head after bleaching her (light brown) hair, with no visible results.  </li>
            <li>think this would be a good refreshing toner possibly, if mixed with a conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this and use it on my bleached hair</li>
            <li>, shiny platinum effect to be more exact, this did the trick.</li>
            <li>but I used kaboom foam cleaner and it was a cinch to clean.</li>
            <li>Price was good, shipping was free and fast and the package was new and sealed.</li>
            <li>Thicker than Manic Panic or Special effects so easier to apply and comb in without dripping.</li>
            <li>Good buy, overall.</li>
            <li>I had to use most of a bottle and leave it in for two hours to make a real difference to my hair color.</li>
            <li>A nice deep purple that faded to a beautiful pink after a month or so.</li>
            <li>This is a good toner for very very bleached, fried white hair.</li>
            <li>USE FIRST: the Jerome Russell&#x27;s highlighting kit!</li>
            <li>honestly think that this would be fine with someone who has white hair and is looking to go  a more silver colour (such as a dye)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for light bleached hair, will make your hair go a pale almost colorless yellow, plus it smells nice.</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised, works super well.</li>
            <li>It does smell good though, but other than that</li>
            <li>Your end result will be a fine, silvery light blonde!</li>
            <li>So, bottom line, not quite a platinum toner, but great for black lights and clubbing!!</li>
            <li>Loved it!, very white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have got a 5 star if the container was larger (took 2) and if it had lasted longer (only about a week)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did very much to my hair.</li>
            <li>The color did stick to the rest of my hair &amp; looks very nice, it definitely canceled out a lot of the yellow color in my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair very dry, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Very effective - WILL turn your hair a pale purple/gray if you use too much or do not apply correctly.</li>
            <li>However, it did smell pretty well.</li>
            <li>and I wanted more of a platinum blonde look at the ends</li>
            <li>It really did nothing for my hair, and I am now looking into actual toners that you need developer for, which I&#x27;m hoping will work better with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do anything to my freshly bleached hair, I didn&#x27;t expect much because I had already tried using so many other toners.</li>
            <li>Did nothing to tone my hair, less effective than a purple shampoo for blondes or greys.</li>
            <li>You have to use the whole thing and keep it in for much longer than recommended to get a desirable result</li>
            <li>it doesnt take much to work either</li>
            <li>Before learning that i could tone my hair for much cheaper by diluting purple hair dye with hair conditioner, I bought this</li>
            <li>Feria Absolute Platinums Hair Color, Very Platinum]]</li>
            <li>, my nearly shaved head was bright yellow blonde.</li>
            <li>There is still some brass but not so much that it bothers me.</li>
            <li>In all honesty I wouldn&#x27;t really call this a toner.</li>
            <li>Maybe some people like that smell, but my boyfriend and I both agreed that to us, it really just smelled like....</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair, tried this twice once at night and again the next morning...</li>
            <li>thanks for nothing...</li>
            <li>and you need a gentle toner.</li>
            <li>Works very well,</li>
            <li>The solution itself did not seem very concentrated pigment-wise.</li>
            <li>you wont get much result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Think Jay from the old America&#x27;s Next Top Model.</li>
            <li>However I noticed a few people said that they actually LIKED the smell.</li>
            <li>I found the key to this products success is lighten, lighten, and lighten!</li>
            <li>This stuff that I usually use is amazing..</li>
            <li>This made my hair softer and it smelled decent, but it did nothing for my hair color...</li>
            <li>Do not put this into your hair, until you are CERTAIN that your hair is the right shade of blonde.</li>
            <li>Love the Color and How long it last</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair, so next time I will buy 3 of this containers, 1 wasnt enough, only comes in 3 some onzes, but I made it work, end result a very nice shiny platinum blonde, smells good, and it conditions the hair as well.</li>
            <li>The toner is a fabulous silver white on the rest of my hair, but my roots are still yellow.</li>
            <li>I think next time I will buy two because one didn&#x27;t saturate my whole head!  </li>
            <li>this product is very drying to the hair and must be left on for at least 40mins for effective appearance.</li>
            <li>This toner was smelled like artificial grapes and was great.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really remove any of the yellow in my hair.</li>
            <li>It does really make my hair white.</li>
            <li>In ten minutes, my hair came out just the right super ash tone, no more brass, and very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It tones down brassiness ok but only until the next shampoo.</li>
            <li>After bleaching my 1/4th of an inch normally reddish brown hair to blonde with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Bleached my hair first, it went a yellowish blonde color which I expected, this toner said it would cool the yellow tones, but did not, dont buy this unless you hair is the lightest possible shade of blonde, before using.</li>
            <li>After using this product it cut out most of the red into a dark blonde and the yellow became silver.</li>
            <li>It is very conditioning and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>It absolutely will not remove the yellow if you haven&#x27;t bleached the yellow out.</li>
            <li>For those of you who do not know, platinum means white/silver blonde, almost a lavender to grey color under certain lights; not just bleached \\&quot;Marylin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only the very whitest of my bleached hairs were toned, and not very noticeably even after leaving it longer than suggested.</li>
            <li>I bleached the ends three times and needed a toner to calm down the Orange-yellow tone I was left with.</li>
            <li>for 45 mins (which is a whole other process, thank the gods I have buzzed hair</li>

            <li> There is still some brass but not so much that it bothers me.</li>
            <li> In all honesty I wouldn&#x27;t really call this a toner.</li>
            <li> Maybe some people like that smell, but my boyfriend and I both agreed that to us, it really just smelled like....</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair, tried this twice once at night and again the next morning...</li>
            <li> thanks for nothing...</li>
            <li> and you need a gentle toner.</li>
            <li> Works very well,</li>
            <li> The solution itself did not seem very concentrated pigment-wise.</li>
            <li> you wont get much result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Think Jay from the old America&#x27;s Next Top Model.</li>
            <li> However I noticed a few people said that they actually LIKED the smell.</li>
            <li> I found the key to this products success is lighten, lighten, and lighten!</li>
            <li> This stuff that I usually use is amazing..</li>
            <li> This made my hair softer and it smelled decent, but it did nothing for my hair color...</li>
            <li> Do not put this into your hair, until you are CERTAIN that your hair is the right shade of blonde.</li>
            <li> Love the Color and How long it last</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, so next time I will buy 3 of this containers, 1 wasnt enough, only comes in 3 some onzes, but I made it work, end result a very nice shiny platinum blonde, smells good, and it conditions the hair as well.</li>
            <li> The toner is a fabulous silver white on the rest of my hair, but my roots are still yellow.</li>
            <li> I think next time I will buy two because one didn&#x27;t saturate my whole head!  </li>
            <li> this product is very drying to the hair and must be left on for at least 40mins for effective appearance.</li>
            <li> This toner was smelled like artificial grapes and was great.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really remove any of the yellow in my hair.</li>
            <li> It does really make my hair white.</li>
            <li> In ten minutes, my hair came out just the right super ash tone, no more brass, and very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It tones down brassiness ok but only until the next shampoo.</li>
            <li> After bleaching my 1/4th of an inch normally reddish brown hair to blonde with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Bleached my hair first, it went a yellowish blonde color which I expected, this toner said it would cool the yellow tones, but did not, dont buy this unless you hair is the lightest possible shade of blonde, before using.</li>
            <li> After using this product it cut out most of the red into a dark blonde and the yellow became silver.</li>
            <li> It is very conditioning and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> It absolutely will not remove the yellow if you haven&#x27;t bleached the yellow out.</li>
            <li> For those of you who do not know, platinum means white/silver blonde, almost a lavender to grey color under certain lights; not just bleached \\&quot;Marylin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only the very whitest of my bleached hairs were toned, and not very noticeably even after leaving it longer than suggested.</li>
            <li> I bleached the ends three times and needed a toner to calm down the Orange-yellow tone I was left with.</li>
            <li> for 45 mins (which is a whole other process, thank the gods I have buzzed hair</li>
            <li> It really did very little if anything to tone my hair after bleaching it out (preparing to dye with various colors).</li>
            <li> For example, my hair is platinum but my roots are yellow because I didn&#x27;t bleach them long enough.</li>
            <li> Although this is a decent toner for bleached hair that has very little warms hues initially, I would not expect this to work the way you might hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Follow the directions on the back of the container~ shampoo and dry DO NOT condition!</li>
            <li> I have dark, medium thin asian hair and I bleached it 3 times with L&#x27;oreal quick blue.</li>
            <li> I have some dark blonde with platinum streaks and neither colour looked any different after 1/2 hour application.</li>
            <li> I have long gray hair and this product helps remove yellowing.  </li>
            <li> If you have anything other than what would already be considered white or platinum blond</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair that I had dyed extra red then went for streaky platinum and dark blonde bleach out.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to make my hair purple, either, as I left the product on for less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair is a very dark brown, borderline black (naturally).</li>
            <li> I then rinsed, dried, and applied JR toner and left it on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not very damaging</li>
            <li> I expected it to work and a lot of people said it worked on their hair, but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> If there is any &#x27;secret&#x27; to using this stuff it is to REALLY coat it in there.</li>
            <li> You need to get your hair a pale like blonde.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair 3 times to a really pale yellow</li>
            <li> Smells like grape soda which is not altogether unpleasant but just looks like light lavender conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you need a reference just go on YouTube and see how other hair types turn out.</li>
            <li> Moreover, I also used the entire jar in one application, whereas I have used other Jerome Russell dye in the past and always had leftovers.</li>
            <li> It did tone my hair without getting too dark again like other toners.</li>
            <li> It did not tone down the brassiness, nor did it impart any purple hue at all.</li>
            <li> Once you slather your hair with the Platinum Blonde (I put a plastic bag over and tied in back for approximately 30 min!)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t even slightly change my hair color either time...</li>
            <li> I applied it after bleaching &amp; left it on for a while then washed it out &amp; didn&#x27;t notice much, so I tried another application, but again disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if it had been just a few shades darker, it would have worked.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know how to use it, because make nothing but waste my time</li>
            <li> the strands of my hair that stuck out of my hair cover &amp; dried out?  </li>
            <li> I just did my hair about a half hour ago and for me,  this delivers!</li>
            <li> Did very very little for my hair.</li>
            <li> After a massive fail on Manic Panic, I tried Punky Color.  </li>
            <li> I usually need two boxes of dye so this doesn&#x27;t surprise me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately though, that&#x27;s not me, so I&#x27;m still on the look-out for something that will actually help tone my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say too much positive about this product. :(</li>
            <li> it actually had a very faint purpe tint</li>
            <li> Total crap, waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> cause that L&#x27;Oreal stuff is THICK!)</li>
            <li> I have dyed blonde hair that had started to take on that brassy orange colour al blondes hate.</li>
            <li> I have medium, thin hair, in a pixie cut.</li>
            <li> If you feel any burning or anything uncomfortable however, STOP and rinse out!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a bad batch</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> just disappointed by the size my mistake though</li>
            <li> disappointed...</li>
            <li> totally hated this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed because it didn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> It was horrible it didn&#x27;t do what I was expecting</li>
            <li> It smells like awful grape kool-aid.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You have to use the whole thing and keep it in for much longer than recommended to get a desirable result</li>
            <li> Did very very little for my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your time. I went to Sally&#x27;s got some wella toner and developer for 10$ and I got amazing results :)</li>
            <li> have used it a few times on different blondes...and seems to really work well....I will purchase again...it doesnt take much to work either</li>
            <li> I had bleached my hair and was going for the whitest shade of platinum I could achieve. All the reviews I&#x27;d read online about this product indicated it would take out that \\&quot;brassy\\&quot; tone in bleached blondes and give me that shiny, white blonde I wanted. Didn&#x27;t happen... instead I got an interesting shade of lavender, which is great if that was what I wanted... yes, I admit it removed the brassiness; but it replaced the gold color with translucent purple! It didn&#x27;t take long to make my hair purple, either, as I left the product on for less than 5 minutes. It was an interesting look, and fortunately, it does wash out over time. So, bottom line, not quite a platinum toner, but great for black lights and clubbing!! lol!!</li>
            <li> just disappointed by the size my mistake though</li>
            <li> I thought this product worked quite well.  In ten minutes, my hair came out just the right super ash tone, no more brass, and very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair did have a nice purple tinge for a couple of days- but a very good conditioner and toner.  Would recommend and who doesn&#x27;t want purple hair anyways?</li>
            <li> After a massive fail on Manic Panic, I tried Punky Color.  Color came out the way it should, smells delicious and I was a happy customer until a week passed.  I know we are talking about &amp;#34;Semi Permanent&amp;#34; hair dye but it has to last longer than just a week.  But I will say this product is better than Manic Panic I used.</li>
            <li> Didnt do anything to my hair left it on for n hour fallowed direction and still no change i color</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! I&#x27;ve been working I&#x27;m getting my hair that perfect platinum color and this definitely achieved this! I think next time I will buy two because one didn&#x27;t saturate my whole head!  I usually need two boxes of dye so this doesn&#x27;t surprise me. And it smells like grape juice!  :) FIVE STARS</li>
            <li> This toner turns your hair a wonderful shade of purple and then fades with everyday washing to a perfect platinum. If you mix it with conditioner you can sometimes avoid the purple tint but I personally love the effect.</li>
            <li> I found the key to this products success is lighten, lighten, and lighten! :) USE FIRST: the Jerome Russell&#x27;s highlighting kit! Follow the directions on the back of the container~ shampoo and dry DO NOT condition! Once you slather your hair with the Platinum Blonde (I put a plastic bag over and tied in back for approximately 30 min!) This intensifies the process! If you feel any burning or anything uncomfortable however, STOP and rinse out! Your end result will be a fine, silvery light blonde! BEAUTIFUL shade!</li>
            <li> This is a good, cheap toner. My hair is a very dark brown, borderline black (naturally). I bleached the ends three times and needed a toner to calm down the Orange-yellow tone I was left with. This worked well for me.</li>
            <li> This made my hair softer and it smelled decent, but it did nothing for my hair color...I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really remove any of the yellow in my hair. However, it did smell pretty well.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair ... I got my hair done at the salon and dyed it ombré .. It still has an orange look to it and I wanted more of a platinum blonde look at the ends and it did nothing. My hair looks the same.</li>
            <li> It does really make my hair white. However it washes out quite quickly, hence you would need to buy more to mantain the colour every now and then</li>
            <li> Bleached my hair first, it went a yellowish blonde color which I expected, this toner said it would cool the yellow tones, but did not, dont buy this unless you hair is the lightest possible shade of blonde, before using.</li>
            <li> It is very conditioning and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair. It works well but I have my own solution that I use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did very much to my hair. Oh well...</li>
            <li> It really did very little if anything to tone my hair after bleaching it out (preparing to dye with various colors). I applied it after bleaching &amp; left it on for a while then washed it out &amp; didn&#x27;t notice much, so I tried another application, but again disappointed. It does smell good though, but other than that I can&#x27;t say too much positive about this product. :(</li>
            <li> Did nothing to tone my hair, less effective than a purple shampoo for blondes or greys. Smells like grape soda which is not altogether unpleasant but just looks like light lavender conditioner. I have some dark blonde with platinum streaks and neither colour looked any different after 1/2 hour application.</li>
            <li> Please!!! Do not put this into your hair, until you are CERTAIN that your hair is the right shade of blonde. It will not work! You need to get your hair a pale like blonde. This a toner. If you need a reference just go on YouTube and see how other hair types turn out. But if your hair is too yellow or orange, this product will not be your best companion. If you need silver, I recommded LA Riche(Fliche) Silver over this product for those with darker blonde hair.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything to my freshly bleached hair, I didn&#x27;t expect much because I had already tried using so many other toners. I ended up just using a purple shampoo, surprisingly that worked much better than anything else.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised, works super well. Not that it matters, but it smells oddly good too. :D It&#x27;s nice to use hair products that don&#x27;t smell all chemical-y. Good buy, overall.</li>
            <li> It was horrible it didn&#x27;t do what I was expecting</li>
            <li> Price was good, shipping was free and fast and the package was new and sealed. Despite following the label directions to the letter three separate times and leaving the product in for longer than the directions said the third time the product does not work. I looked on their website to see if had made some mistake - nope. The product simply had NO effect on the color of my hair. My hair has never been dyed before and it is sandy brown. But this stuff is non-functional. Maybe it&#x27;s a bad batch but whatever the reason, it is totally ineffective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product! Made my hair mostly white! And it smells like grape medicine, but I love that smell.</li>
            <li> Loved it!, very white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have got a 5 star if the container was larger (took 2) and if it had lasted longer (only about a week)</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely works.</li>
            <li> Love the Color and How long it last</li>
            <li> It tones down brassiness ok but only until the next shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t last. For the price it should be better.</li>
            <li> It works awesome.  The only dye I use</li>
            <li> Before learning that i could tone my hair for much cheaper by diluting purple hair dye with hair conditioner, I bought this i hopes that it would tone my hair. The problem with this hair toner is that it is too light to stick in the hair and cause any changes. Perhaps if it had been just a few shades darker, it would have worked. Moreover, I also used the entire jar in one application, whereas I have used other Jerome Russell dye in the past and always had leftovers.</li>
            <li> Smells really good. Helped me tone my hair amazingly.</li>
            <li> the product did not work.</li>
            <li> I have dyed blonde hair that had started to take on that brassy orange colour al blondes hate. Decided to try this toner because it was a good price and had okay reviews... my advice is DO NOT BUY! It is literally purple hair dye. not a toner. totally hated this stuff. Would never buy again. This stuff that I usually use is amazing.. but amazon is out of stock and I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere else... http://www.amazon.com/Schwarzkopf-Igora-Color-Conditioning-Mousse/dp/B001Q9C1H4?tag&#x3D;delightsale-20</li>
            <li> I love punky color but it would have been better to buy two. Next time I&#x27;ll buy two it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> This product does not tone whatsoever. I used it after I bleached my hair to help with brassiness, but it didn&#x27;t work at all. Just save your money. If you are going to buy it anyway.. It smells good, but that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> For those of you who do not know, platinum means white/silver blonde, almost a lavender to grey color under certain lights; not just bleached \\&quot;Marylin Monroe\\&quot; blonde. Think Jay from the old America&#x27;s Next Top Model. I just did my hair about a half hour ago and for me,  this delivers! After bleaching my 1/4th of an inch normally reddish brown hair to blonde with [[ASIN:B00C53T44S L&#x27;Oreal Paris Feria Absolute Platinums Hair Color, Very Platinum]] for 45 mins (which is a whole other process, thank the gods I have buzzed hair cause that L&#x27;Oreal stuff is THICK!), my nearly shaved head was bright yellow blonde. I then rinsed, dried, and applied JR toner and left it on for 20 minutes. The smell of the dye is pleasant, the amount is plentiful, and the result was a perfect translucent light lavender almost silver hue which I can tell will fade beautifully over the next few days. I am very pleased with the results (Amber Rose, eat your heart out!) and will use again. I used Manic Panic for this same look and length hair back in 95 and it didn&#x27;t work as well to my recollection. 5 stars for the at home colourist!</li>
            <li> Did nothing to my existing highlights. Still brassy.</li>
            <li> Loved the color. A nice deep purple that faded to a beautiful pink after a month or so. I got a lot of compliments on my hair. It didn&#x27;t stain my pillow or when tub when I washed my hair. If a stray purple hair fell in the bathroom, it would stain the sink or floor but I used kaboom foam cleaner and it was a cinch to clean.</li>
            <li> It did tone my hair without getting too dark again like other toners. The wella toner, I got in the lightest ton but made my hair brown instead of blonde like I wanted. This toner was smelled like artificial grapes and was great. I have dark, medium thin asian hair and I bleached it 3 times with L&#x27;oreal quick blue. The product was used on my ends so I could use this product two times. There is still some brass but not so much that it bothers me.</li>
            <li> I missed having white hair, and this gave me it. It also smells so good, and leaves hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this colour is SEMI-PERMANENT. It will wash out. How soon it washes out depends on your hair.</li>
            <li> This product is great and very easy to use.The best thing about it is that there is no brassiness to my hair when I use this product and my hair is very dark brown.</li>
            <li> Not so good wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair 3 times to a really pale yellow then I applied the platinum toner for 30 Minutes.  After washing it out my hair was still the same Shade. The grape smell is very pleasant though</li>
            <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li> It works fine. I have to leave it on for hours to get to the platinum blonde. Not very damaging</li>
            <li> In all honesty I wouldn&#x27;t really call this a toner. I&#x27;m sure if your hair is already very very light blonde that it would make it that beautiful lavender silver colour, but if you have any orangey/brassy colours in your hair, you&#x27;re kinda out of luck. It really did nothing for my hair, and I am now looking into actual toners that you need developer for, which I&#x27;m hoping will work better with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair very dry, which is nice. However I noticed a few people said that they actually LIKED the smell. Which I just couldn&#x27;t believe. It smells like awful grape kool-aid. Maybe some people like that smell, but my boyfriend and I both agreed that to us, it really just smelled like.... purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly think that this would be fine with someone who has white hair and is looking to go  a more silver colour (such as a dye), so I gave it two stars. Unfortunately though, that&#x27;s not me, so I&#x27;m still on the look-out for something that will actually help tone my hair.</li>
            <li> Total crap, waste of money and time.  I have light brown hair, tried this twice once at night and again the next morning...didn&#x27;t even slightly change my hair color either time...disappointed...gotta scrap my halloween costume and just not participate this year...thanks for nothing...</li>
            <li> This is a good toner for very very bleached, fried white hair. It absolutely will not remove the yellow if you haven&#x27;t bleached the yellow out. For example, my hair is platinum but my roots are yellow because I didn&#x27;t bleach them long enough. The toner is a fabulous silver white on the rest of my hair, but my roots are still yellow. It&#x27;s semi permanent which is why it&#x27;s great if your hair, like mine, is fried and you need a gentle toner. Smells grapey.</li>
            <li> Bad. I still don&#x27;t know how to use it, because make nothing but waste my time</li>
            <li> I would have rated this 0 stars but I couldn&#x27;t. This item didn&#x27;t work on my hair. I can easily say I wont be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells nice and mild on your hair and scalp</li>
            <li> Works very well, I love punky color, always strong and to the point.</li>
            <li> I have long gray hair and this product helps remove yellowing.  My hair now looks a beatiful silvery gray. which now, I get alot of compliments on my hair. I would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> It did not work.  I put it on my daughter&#x27;s head after bleaching her (light brown) hair, with no visible results.  It did not tone down the brassiness, nor did it impart any purple hue at all.</li>
            <li> I give this 2 stars because it&#x27;s not as good as I thought it would be. I was excited to get this and use it on my bleached hair but I was very disappointed because it didn&#x27;t work that well. The reason why I bought this was because it says it&#x27;ll tone brassy/orangey hair. It didn&#x27;t quite do that. It just left a very good scent on my hair but did not take out the brassyness of it. I expected it to work and a lot of people said it worked on their hair, but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> my hair was WHITE after i used this. it actually had a very faint purpe tint o it for like 2 days. it smells like grape kool aid and theres alot in the jar</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for light bleached hair, will make your hair go a pale almost colorless yellow, plus it smells nice. But I prefer to mix my own toner, its cheaper and I can neutralise the specific tones that I want to.</li>
            <li> It only works so so. But at last it isn&#x27;t harmful to the hair. Better toners exist.</li>
            <li> this product is very drying to the hair and must be left on for at least 40mins for effective appearance.</li>
            <li> Bought the &amp;#34;platinum blonde&amp;#34;, and worked wonderfully. I already had used a Wella T10 to tone the brassiness of my attempt to get a platinum blonde and it worked well but I wanted a Wao effect, shiny platinum effect to be more exact, this did the trick. I started from the bottom part of my hair worked it all to the top. I have long thick hair, so next time I will buy 3 of this containers, 1 wasnt enough, only comes in 3 some onzes, but I made it work, end result a very nice shiny platinum blonde, smells good, and it conditions the hair as well. Very happy with my purchase, planning to keep using as part of my color routine to keep the color popping each month.</li>
            <li> It worked as discribed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I prefer Manic Panic.&lt;br /&gt;Probably won&#x27;t be trying this again.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t have a good experience.</li>
            <li> This is the best temporary toner I have used. Thicker than Manic Panic or Special effects so easier to apply and comb in without dripping. Very effective - WILL turn your hair a pale purple/gray if you use too much or do not apply correctly.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to use a LOT of this stuff. If there is any &#x27;secret&#x27; to using this stuff it is to REALLY coat it in there. I have medium, thin hair, in a pixie cut. I had to use most of a bottle and leave it in for two hours to make a real difference to my hair color. If you have more hair you are going to need more than one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;And the strands of my hair that stuck out of my hair cover &amp; dried out?  The color didn&#x27;t stick. The color did stick to the rest of my hair &amp; looks very nice, it definitely canceled out a lot of the yellow color in my hair. But I have better results, faster from using Wella Color Charm T18 &amp; a 20% developer. But this is definitely a contender for touch-ups and a weekly conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a couple different brands, including Manic Panic. And I&#x27;ve had varying results from different colors. I like this brand better than the Manic Panic, but mostly because I think it smells better &amp; the price is slightly better. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in quality or color out-come.</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair that I had dyed extra red then went for streaky platinum and dark blonde bleach out. I had a lot of yellow and red tones left in my hair. After using this product it cut out most of the red into a dark blonde and the yellow became silver. Perfect!!! It also smells great-like grapes! I would recommend this if your bleach out just stops short of bleached.</li>
            <li> Although this is a decent toner for bleached hair that has very little warms hues initially, I would not expect this to work the way you might hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the very whitest of my bleached hairs were toned, and not very noticeably even after leaving it longer than suggested. The solution itself did not seem very concentrated pigment-wise. If you have anything other than what would already be considered white or platinum blond you wont get much result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a good refreshing toner possibly, if mixed with a conditioner.</li>
            <li> The toner didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    </ol>
