            <li>right after my treatment I can feel how soft my skin have become, the shine on my skin was so bright and light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended but you will need to give this product at least 3 months to see the best results.</li>
            <li>I believe it works better for older age skin.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that after using it when I follow with a moisturizer, it is absorbed more readily.  </li>
            <li>Btw, this vendor was very fast and even included a free eye mask.</li>
            <li>My husband who usually does not notice stuffs even commented on my beautiful skin after my use of this product with the spa machine.  </li>
            <li>Also right after the treatment is recommended to use yr daily product because you will feel how amazing how well your product can absorb into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a joke, this does absolutely nothing but drain your bank account !</li>
            <li>You really do see a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with MK Halos for the fast shipment as I&#x27;m leaving in Singapore, I will suprise my shipment came 5 days earlier then expected!</li>

            <li> I really do like this product and I do see significent results.  However, I do find it a little on the expensive side.</li>

            <li> I fell for this gimmick, don&#x27;t do what I did !&lt;br /&gt;What a joke, this does absolutely nothing but drain your bank account !</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I can give myself a $50 facial at home whenever I want.  I love how my skin looks after I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> Since I started using the NuSkin Galvanic Spa with these special gels, I get compliments every day about how great my skin looks!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and even though it&#x27;s not much cheaper than ordering it directly from Nu Skin I did save a couple dollars.</li>
            <li> Good machine I bought it not knowing a lot about it but was pleasantly surprised, would recommend it, good price</li>
            <li> Feels good after using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it makes my skin look soooooo much cleaner and better.  Notice I didn&#x27;t say younger, it makes my skin look clean and thereby better.  Looking younger doesn&#x27;t always mean you look good. We should strive to look as good as we can at any age.</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old. I feel it helps but not that easy to tell from a short using time. I believe it works better for older age skin.</li>
            <li> They seem to be working.....nothing is getting worse....it just stays the same.  Maybe Nuskin doesn&#x27;t work miracles on 50+ skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using product for years, love it and suggest it who needs a beauty regimen. but must use the galvanic</li>
            <li> Love this product. You really do see a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really makes a difference in looking younger and fresher. I use it regularly and have had people ask if I have had a &amp;#34;procedure&amp;#34; recently.</li>
            <li> Please note that a Sponsor Distributor ID# is not a promo code and it should not be posted and used freely, it&#x27;s against Nu Skin&#x27;s policy for a good reason. Would you want someone unethical to be your business partner? What if you like using Nu Skin products so much that you want to become an active distributor? If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you could get stuck with a business partner you hate for life. I had bought Nu Skin products about 5 years ago from a beauty salon and I love it. Now, I&#x27;m a distributor and have a wonderful sponsor distributor to help and guide me to grow my Nu Skin business. This might be the business opportunity that you&#x27;ve been looking for and it may become your future and retirement income one day. Please don&#x27;t throw it away lightly by signing up with a wrong distributor who we already know is unethical.</li>
            <li> Oh my God, these gels, along with the Galvanic Facial Spa will take 10 years off your face in 10 minutes. You must buy the Galvanic facial Spa first, the gels only work with it. Both items are worth every dime spent on it. It&#x27;s like having your own spa in the privacy of your own home.[[ASIN:B005PYXEKE Nuskin Nu Skin ReDesign ageLoc Galvanic Face Spa Package(Black or White)]]</li>
            <li> nice product ! love it !</li>
            <li> To purchase Nu Skin products, go to  nuskin com, click on your country, then click on &amp;#34;Sign up as Customer&amp;#34; and enter sponsor ID: USW8836585&lt;br /&gt;If you would like 30% discount, sign up as a distributor, by going to nuskin com, click on your country, click on &amp;#34;Sign up as distributor&amp;#34; and enter sponsor ID:USW8836585</li>
            <li> These work with the Nuskin Galvanic Spa face exerciser.  A little expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find alternatives for it.  I know a facial/cosmetician that loves what it does to the skin (lifts and conditions), and she uses these on all her clients.  Suppose to use clear one first followed by the blue tiny container but I use white one a couple of nights then use the blue for a couple of nights.  I use the spa device 6 nights a week.</li>
            <li> this is very nice  i like it !!dont know when it works!!!hope it is real and works on me fast@</li>
            <li> I feel very good about there entire product line the gels  have a good amount in them and afterwards your skin looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> excellent product and ok price, its very good for your skin lines, it really works with the galvanic equipments on your face</li>
            <li> We received the order on time. So far no issues.</li>
            <li> Well received by purchase. Makes well over reasonable good</li>
            <li> I use them for years!</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast delivered</li>
            <li> this product is very good and have to use with nu-skin face spa after used 2 weeks later you will see the result.</li>
            <li> I couldnt care less but my wife says its great and meets her requirement so there you go, good buy</li>
            <li> These facial gels are unbelievable. The results are immediate used with the &amp;#34;Galvanic Spa System&amp;#34;. If possible, buy the &amp;#34;Tru Face liner Corrector&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Use it with the spa machine and it will give you miraculous results.  My husband who usually does not notice stuffs even commented on my beautiful skin after my use of this product with the spa machine.  Excellent product!  Very good price!!  At this price, I will reorder again and again for sure.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this.  She is convinced that it works, but takes a lot longer than expected.  She has used it most nights for the past several months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with MK Halos for the fast shipment as I&#x27;m leaving in Singapore, I will suprise my shipment came 5 days earlier then expected! And product is as delivered as promised. highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok! For the products now, I&#x27;m using this product for my 3rd round ( Once a week ) right after my treatment I can feel how soft my skin have become, the shine on my skin was so bright and light. Also right after the treatment is recommended to use yr daily product because you will feel how amazing how well your product can absorb into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended but you will need to give this product at least 3 months to see the best results.</li>
            <li> Product works well.  Nice to do my own facials at home.  A bit pricey but still less expensive than a professional facial.  I have noticed that after using it when I follow with a moisturizer, it is absorbed more readily.  Perfect for the desert climate I live in.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for skin spa with Nuskin Galvanic.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel skin is tighter and brighter after using.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfy the product except the shipping is slow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the product but I do think I see a difference. My skin seems tighter. Less saggy. More youthful. Takes awhile to get the hang of how to use the machine. Try to find a good sales rep to show you how to use it. I had a lot of trial and error. Btw, this vendor was very fast and even included a free eye mask. That was a nice surprise.</li>
