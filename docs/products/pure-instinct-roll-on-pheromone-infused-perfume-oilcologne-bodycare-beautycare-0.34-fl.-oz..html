            <li>I love the fact I wear this my own pheromone scent</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t attract men like flies but if you already have a guy then he&#x27;ll act more into you, well atleast mine did.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I get soon many compliments on this perfume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay not all that.</li>
            <li>Ok I thought this stuff was a joke.  </li>
            <li>I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Tried</li>
            <li>I always use this with one of many colognes, and im always told I smell amazin.</li>
            <li>I get more complements</li>
            <li>I love the smell, makes me want myself.</li>
            <li>im asked many times what that perfume is</li>
            <li>but maybe their immune to falling in love.</li>
            <li>Besides that it smells ok.</li>
            <li>Love that it comes in a roller ball</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed my husband tends to be more &amp;#34;Alert/Cuddly&amp;#34; of me while I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>I notice guys being slightly more flurtacious wen</li>
            <li>Smell was ok</li>
            <li>He has become a lot more flirtatious since I started wearing this too.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually think it would work so well, but I am very happy.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I was actully cute that day..</li>
            <li>I love the smell and so does my hubby.</li>
            <li>It is very light, and can easily be layered under a floral or &amp;#34;food&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent, however it disappears very quickly, as in minutes.</li>
            <li>Aroma fades quickly, though it is a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry and love the enchanting smell</li>
            <li>I love how well it mixes with my other perfumes, providing a delightful hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li>This product is the best thing i have tried it gives me a sent thats unique to me and only me.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery too!</li>
            <li>This little roll on perfume is awesome.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say my husband has or has not paid any extra attention to me but has a great light almost citrusy scent, does seem to be oil based.</li>
            <li>but much smells amazing after 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Smells okay, not as great as I expected by reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Which is nice sometimes and not so nice other times, so use with caution.</li>
            <li>I love the Pure Romance version of this</li>
            <li>Overall good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Also since using this men have been flocking around my girl friend and me at dances and our dance cards are full now.  </li>
            <li>Smells like sickeningly sweet cotton candy/bubble gum...nor does it work for me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet - smells a bit like citrus bubblegum.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>Smell fresh, like clean clothes smell</li>
            <li>Regardless if it actually makes my husband more attracted to me, he and I both love the scent, and it gives me a confidence boost.</li>
            <li>One day I can smell like warm cookies, the next day like sweet sugar.</li>
            <li>Smell nice in bottle,scent doesnt last after you put it on.</li>
            <li>but is okay since is a soft smell.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Will recommend and more than likely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Does not last, reapplying more often than I care to.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;m still waiting currently on my perfume</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>As for expecting positive reactions of others?</li>
            <li>I could tell he was more attracted and attentive to me than usual.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase this again.</li>
            <li>and i tell the pure instinct..</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try this out because it&#x27;s so much cheaper</li>
            <li>Idk if it really works, I just started using it.</li>
            <li>works really well.</li>
            <li>How could it really work?  </li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>I think it works - but who really knows?</li>
            <li>first day I had so much new attention</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this attracts anyone or not, hormonally, but the scent is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would get a reaction out of someone particular</li>
            <li>this product i would highly recommend to any women.</li>
            <li>I didnt notice any extra or different male attention though, but still worth it for the scent :-)</li>
            <li>I wear it everyday and love it</li>
            <li>I normally do gef attention.</li>
            <li>The product wasn&#x27;t packaged good and was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li>Its a little strong but if you don&#x27;t use too much it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>i enjoy using as i do my other fragrances..</li>
            <li>guys are definitely not chasing me down the street pledging their undying love...</li>
            <li>My significant other LOVES this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it,  only complaint is that the top doesn&#x27;t twist around it so it doesn&#x27;t seal it tight.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow....  </li>
            <li>As far as getting attention.</li>
            <li>A significant amount of perfume was missing (not as the picture shows).</li>
            <li>Too bad, because it smells nice when first applied.</li>
            <li>Um wow, I can&#x27;t believe this actually works!  </li>
            <li>Spell by Victoria secret is my favorite scent I mix the two</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the roller ball is kind of hard to move but other than that its worth the money.</li>
            <li>I notice i get a little more attention than usual when i wear it.</li>
            <li>The smell to me smells like strawberry bubble gum, but it is not long lasting.</li>

            <li> The smell to me smells like strawberry bubble gum, but it is not long lasting.</li>
            <li> I like pure instinct ..it enhances my natural scent and amplifies other colognes i have..its not a love potion like people expect ..</li>
            <li> but it doesnt last long</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li> Smell didnt last long.</li>
            <li> It doesnt last long as I read, but I keep it in my purse and re-apply.</li>
            <li> Only con being the roller ball doesn&#x27;t roll well and its sorta rough in texture.</li>
            <li> We are mid aged ladies btw.  </li>
            <li> Was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected &amp; does not seem to attract anyone.  </li>
            <li> Few women seemed overall receptive to the pheromones.  </li>
            <li> It was funny because i rubbed a little on a dumb bell that has a foam like material..</li>
            <li> It is EXTREMELY flowery scented.</li>
            <li> He says &amp;#34;I like your OTHER smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I wear those along with my other perfume</li>

            <li> This stuff sucks. A girl I  know had some pheromone perfume (which should smell slightly different with each person as it enhances the pheromones your body gives off) and I love it. I thought I&#x27;d try this because it looked similar and it seriously smells like something my grandmother would wear. It is EXTREMELY flowery scented. NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> This may have had some effects because i caught him sniffing around on things like a dog. It was funny because i rubbed a little on a dumb bell that has a foam like material.. Lol its not too strong scented,  so i asked why are you sniffing a weight lol....</li>
            <li> I love the Pure Romance version of this so I thought I&#x27;d try this out because it&#x27;s so much cheaper and I really like it! There&#x27;s a slight difference between the two but it&#x27;s not a bad thing. I will continue buying this.</li>
            <li> I think it works!!! I get lots of compliments!!! Not lots of sex, just lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Shipping was timely and was received when promised. That is why it got 3 stars. It smells sort of like carnations, floral yet spicy. I so wanted it to work as promised...fail.</li>
            <li> It arrived before the estimated day. Smells great..definitely varies per person. It doesn&#x27;t attract men like flies but if you already have a guy then he&#x27;ll act more into you, well atleast mine did. Will recommend and more than likely purchase again. Only con being the roller ball doesn&#x27;t roll well and its sorta rough in texture. Overall good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells good without being overbearing which is important with someone who has migraines as I do.  Also since using this men have been flocking around my girl friend and me at dances and our dance cards are full now.  She liked it so well she bought some too.  We are mid aged ladies btw.  Great perfume!!!</li>
            <li> it realy makes girls notice me</li>
            <li> She liked it for her own perfume. But did not like it on me. Thought I had been cheating or something. No good</li>
            <li> Smells great. Use for both men and women.  I like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this attracts anyone or not, hormonally, but the scent is amazing.  It is very light, and can easily be layered under a floral or &amp;#34;food&amp;#34; scent.  I use vanilla and brown sugar body spray with it and it makes an amazing combo.  Regardless if it actually makes my husband more attracted to me, he and I both love the scent, and it gives me a confidence boost.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell. I couldn&#x27;t get it to come off</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say my husband has or has not paid any extra attention to me but has a great light almost citrusy scent, does seem to be oil based.</li>
            <li> Smells really good but it doesnt last long</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Idk if it really works, I just started using it. But it makes me smell good.</li>
            <li> works really well. I wold definitely buy again</li>
            <li> One of my favorites....</li>
            <li> I get soon many compliments on this perfume.  I wear it everyday and love it</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE it!!!! My man loves it as well! I will soooo buy again. Very Happy! Thank You!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> It smells the same as pure romance to me, but my spouse thinks it&#x27;s stinks and asked me to wash it off.</li>
            <li> has a hint of urine smell</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> very nice smell and easy to use. Always having it in my purse</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay not all that.But I think it does not work to attract anybody not even a fly.</li>
            <li> Ok I thought this stuff was a joke.  How could it really work?  All I can say is wow....  first day I had so much new attention it was crazy.  It smells bad when I first apply it but much smells amazing after 15 minutes.  Truly magic in a bottle!</li>
            <li> Smells like strawberry.  Not what I expected &amp; does not seem to attract anyone.  Have not received any comments when wearing product.</li>
            <li> Very good smell.  I like it.</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t packaged good and was broken when I received it. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> Not liking this product. Does not last, reapplying more often than I care to. Doubt that I will order again</li>
            <li> My boyfriend can tell every time I put this stuff on. It drives him insane! He absolutely loves it! And I love it too, to be honest. It smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells like sickeningly sweet cotton candy/bubble gum...nor does it work for me</li>
            <li> I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Tried different ones and this one works and smell great&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
            <li> I like pure instinct ..it enhances my natural scent and amplifies other colognes i have..its not a love potion like people expect ..lol..guys are definitely not chasing me down the street pledging their undying love...but it does seem to give a little added boost..people tell me i smell nice when i wear it..and the person I&#x27;m dating is all up on me when i wear it..which is a lot..its become a perfume staple for me..i enjoy using as i do my other fragrances..</li>
            <li> Love it,  only complaint is that the top doesn&#x27;t twist around it so it doesn&#x27;t seal it tight.</li>
            <li> I always use this with one of many colognes, and im always told I smell amazin. I get more complements whn I use this.</li>
            <li> My SO LOVES this perfume. It drives him crazy and he doesn&#x27;t even know it! In order to see if it would work, I ordered it and didn&#x27;t tell him that I was wearing it. I could tell he was more attracted and attentive to me than usual. Not only that, but I actually saw an increase in flirting and advances from random guys too. Which is nice sometimes and not so nice other times, so use with caution.</li>
            <li> I just love this scent!</li>
            <li> This little roll on perfume is awesome. I love how well it mixes with my other perfumes, providing a delightful hint of sweetness. I will certainly purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! My second time, oily ordering this!!!!</li>
            <li> My significant other LOVES this stuff! If I wear anything different (even very expensive perfume) he gets upset. He says &amp;#34;I like your OTHER smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the fact I wear this my own pheromone scent gives me a different smell each time. One day I can smell like warm cookies, the next day like sweet sugar. I wear those along with my other perfume and I must say the blends are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Smells good/fruity but it gives me a headache from the odor and no evidence of attraction from  opposite sex</li>
            <li> Smell nice in bottle,scent doesnt last after you put it on.</li>
            <li> The smell will be slightly different for everyone because it is a pheromone. I love the smell, makes me want myself. Haha the smells stays one my all night thru the morning!</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing i have tried it gives me a sent thats unique to me and only me. When i wear it im asked many times what that perfume is and i tell the pure instinct.. this product i would highly recommend to any women.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would get a reaction out of someone particular but maybe their immune to falling in love. Besides that it smells ok.</li>
            <li> wonderful scented item</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, on me it&#x27;s sweet - smells a bit like citrus bubblegum. Doesn&#x27;t last long at all but maybe that&#x27;s just to MY nose.</li>
            <li> Love that it comes in a roller ball</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this scent does not last long. Too bad, because it smells nice when first applied.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m still waiting currently on my perfume but I have purchased this b4 and I&#x27;ve noticed my husband tends to be more &amp;#34;Alert/Cuddly&amp;#34; of me while I&#x27;m wearing it. Especially if we are jus chillin on the couch. It seems like it&#x27;s always works. I notice guys being slightly more flurtacious wen me n my girlfriends go out n wear it too. And it smells great.</li>
            <li> Didnt work. Smell didnt last long. Smell was ok</li>
            <li> Um wow, I can&#x27;t believe this actually works!  My husband can&#x27;t stop sniffing me lol.  He has become a lot more flirtatious since I started wearing this too.  I didn&#x27;t actually think it would work so well, but I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Smells okay, not as great as I expected by reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Love Spell by Victoria secret is my favorite scent I mix the two and it&#x27;s great. :)</li>
            <li> smells good, but for guy to notice me because of it no. my boyfriend likes the smell, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume!!! So many compliments when I wear it! Even smells great on my husband, a woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I purchased the item. I love the scent. It doesnt last long as I read, but I keep it in my purse and re-apply. The roll on application makes it simple. I didnt notice any extra or different male attention though, but still worth it for the scent :-)</li>
            <li> Love the scent, however it disappears very quickly, as in minutes.</li>
            <li> The product did not come as described. A significant amount of perfume was missing (not as the picture shows). As for expecting positive reactions of others? I didn&#x27;t see any difference. The smell to me smells like strawberry bubble gum, but it is not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Aroma fades quickly, though it is a nice smell. Haven&#x27;t noticed any actual pheromone effects.</li>
            <li> Smell fresh, like clean clothes smell lol. Not the best but is okay since is a soft smell. As far as getting attention. I normally do gef attention. But i try it and went groceey shoping and every man was looking at me! Cant tell if it was for this or becuse I was actully cute that day.. lol just try it for yourself</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described. Shipping was a bit slow, but arrived.</li>
            <li> Few women seemed overall receptive to the pheromones.  However,  I&#x27;ve  noticed if women appear to be feeling really good  they will eat this stuff up.</li>
            <li> Its a little strong but if you don&#x27;t use too much it works like a charm. I haven&#x27;t had any reaction to it and i have sensative skin. I notice i get a little more attention than usual when i wear it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and so does my hubby. My only complaint is that the roller ball is kind of hard to move but other than that its worth the money.</li>
            <li> I think it works - but who really knows?</li>
            <li> Easy to carry and love the enchanting smell</li>
