            <li>I want to say that the earplugs also have their own little place on the mask to be secure .&lt;br</li>
            <li>She said that it is very soft, keeps the light out, and she loves the &amp;#34;ONE BAG&amp;#34; for storage.  </li>
            <li>quality and Very fast</li>
            <li>and they both stated it was very comfortable and totally darkened the room for them</li>
            <li>then you probably know exactly what I am talking about</li>
            <li>The first night that I had it, I had to try it out.</li>
            <li>My bedroom is located near the bathroom in our house and there is always a light on.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sleep mask!</li>
            <li>The silk makes it so soft and comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>the strap came out of the mask part the first night...</li>
            <li>The velcro fastening holds well and doesnt get in the way at all while I&#x27;m sleeping; it keeps out all the light but is light and thin (read: no slipping mask or sweating face); the color is a great purple.  </li>
            <li>I ordered extra for a friend and two more to spare for myself</li>
            <li>however this sleeping mask broke the first week on me</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a big head, this might not be super comfortable for you.</li>
            <li>Ok , Ok, hold on,now we have most all used a sleeping mask before, worrisome huh, it will not fit over  your head or is so tight you can not sleep</li>
            <li>earplugs, and all of this comes in a nice little bag to keep in for travel, for home, for washing it in that bag.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask comes with a  nice little carrying bag that can also be used in the washer.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a wash bad, which is great for storage also.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(haha) got ya there</li>
            <li>The outside of the mask is silky smooth, and the interior is made of a breathable fabric.  </li>
            <li>It fits very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not being constantly bothered by the light now.  </li>
            <li>I also really like that it has a spot in the strap for the ear plugs.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye mask.</li>
            <li>but I do not travel much.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;s about time for me to get a REAL sleep mask.</li>
            <li>Other than the strap, this sleep mask is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I cant wait to purchase more in other colors to go along with my Jammies.</li>
            <li>It worked just fine for my husband and my son, but they both have long slender noses</li>
            <li>Or the person with the constant cough on the bus full of people.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft, not scratchy like some, not thin like others.</li>
            <li>I also ike the fact that it fit me just right,not to tight,not to loose.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is made from high quality satin and velvet with velcro straps.  </li>
            <li>We both highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this sleep mask to anyone.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t adjust it to fit tight enough around my nose to keep the light out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been sleeping with those complimentary in-flight eye masks for the last 6 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised this is not a big issue for most female reviewers.</li>
            <li>I believe it will be fine for most people, but if you have a very small nose you may have the same problem I did.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the sleep mask comes with its own mesh bag for washing so that it&#x27;s less likely to get snagged on anything else in your wash</li>
            <li>The straps are very soft and adjustable with a velcro closure and are multipurpose as they also conveniently hold the earplugs as well.</li>
            <li>they are very soft cover the eyes</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the first and only store,wash, and travel bag of</li>
            <li>it helps dim down the sound; sometimes I don&#x27;t even hear the noise of the TV.</li>
            <li>but they were soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft against your skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother you during the night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for an adult</li>
            <li>It is like a natural sleep aid, so if you have problems with insomnia, light , or late nighters</li>
            <li>I have used it and will continue to use it, no other brand could come between .</li>
            <li>Lastly, I also noticed a tear in the satin fabric near the nose bridge area.</li>
            <li>The one banded design is not as comfortable as the two elastic bands in the back which allow you to position them the way you&#x27;d like especially that I like to sleep with my hair up instead of down.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been sleeping with those complimentary in-flight eye masks for the last 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised this is not a big issue for most female reviewers.</li>
            <li> I believe it will be fine for most people, but if you have a very small nose you may have the same problem I did.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the sleep mask comes with its own mesh bag for washing so that it&#x27;s less likely to get snagged on anything else in your wash</li>
            <li> The straps are very soft and adjustable with a velcro closure and are multipurpose as they also conveniently hold the earplugs as well.</li>

            <li> First of all it was very small, it barely covered my eyes.</li>
            <li> Usually there is a little light creeping through but now with this sleep mask.</li>
            <li> To my lover to buy, she is practical after noon sleep a lot, I should have bought a long time ago</li>
            <li> Also, I had purchased one a few months back from a local cheapo store...</li>

            <li> Thank you for getting the purple and the pink.  </li>
            <li> I like the velco feature so that I can tighten it to the size of my head, as ones I&#x27;ve used previously end up too loose and slide all over.</li>
            <li> I will change my review if I get the other masks by Thursday.</li>
            <li> Want to sleep in the dark?</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the strap that goes around your head.</li>

            <li> With this sleep mask on I can hit the snooze button on my brain and sleep a little while longer.  </li>
            <li> My hair got caught in it a few times but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>

I knew you would love it .No more peek a boos for you.

It is very soft, not scratchy like some, not thin like others. You will get your night of sleep with the mask. I have used it and will continue to use it, no other brand could come between .

I have mine and keep it right on my nightstand , so go on and get yours today, I know you will like The Color combo Purple Sleep Mask. Enjoy a good nights rest for the rest of the night .

            <li> I felt like a movie Star,omg! this is great, it didnt et any light in.The fabric is so silky, smooth, and its my favorite color.Love the bag that came with it.An added plus was the ears plugs that came with it.I have had oth Sleep mask before, but this is by far the best I have had so far.I cant wait to purchase more in other colors to go along with my Jammies.This is my 100% unbiased opinio. I also ike the fact that it fit me just right,not to tight,not to loose.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people that can not go to sleep without something covering my eyes.  Even if it is pitch black in my room, my mind will not shut off.  With this sleep mask on I can hit the snooze button on my brain and sleep a little while longer.  If you are a sleep mask wearer then you probably know exactly what I am talking about, right?  This sleep mask is made from high quality satin and velvet with velcro straps.  It has ear plugs that slide conveniently into the straps.  When I am not using them I can still leave them in place and they don&#x27;t go anywhere, which is cool because I was sure they would have gotten lost by now.  It comes with a handy bag to store it in.  The mask is washable in cold water and can go in the dryer on delicate.  I use my sleep mask every night but even for people who don&#x27;t use them regularly then having one while you are traveling is a bonus to keep the distractions out of your eyes and ears so you can have a piece of mind.  You know that screaming baby on the airplane.  Or the person with the constant cough on the bus full of people.  You will wish you had that sleep mask and ear plugs then.  *received for testing and review.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is almost perfect. My only complaint is the strap that goes around your head. Even on the furthest part of the velcro, it was still slightly too big. I made it work though. My hair got caught in it a few times but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle. Other than the strap, this sleep mask is very comfortable. I am happy to finally have a sleep mask that eliminates all of the light around me. Usually there is a little light creeping through but now with this sleep mask. It fits comfortably above my nose and around my eyes. I do not use ear plugs but they were soft. I like that the sleep mask has a holder for the ear plugs built into it. This sleep mask comes with a  nice little carrying bag that can also be used in the washer. I recommend this sleep mask for anyone who has trouble sleeping because of sensitivity to lights. It is very comfortable. Just be warned about the velcro strap. If you don&#x27;t have a big head, this might not be super comfortable for you. It&#x27;s worth it to me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this sleep mask and ear plugs at reduced rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Bought this sleep mask for my wife because she works at night and sleeps during the day.  She said that it is very soft, keeps the light out, and she loves the &amp;#34;ONE BAG&amp;#34; for storage.  I say that she looks sexy wearing the sleep mask.  We both highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask has tiny elastic pockets on the side of the band to store ear plugs.  The ear plugs fit very comfortably and help reduce any noise that prevents me from falling asleep.  The outside of the mask is silky smooth, and the interior is made of a breathable fabric.  I like the fact that the sleep mask comes with its own mesh bag for washing so that it&#x27;s less likely to get snagged on anything else in your wash load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In return for my candid assessment of this product, I received a discount on this product.</li>
            <li> When I sleep it has to be completely quiet and completely dark. My husband says that I have to sleep like a vampire. I just had to have this Purple Sleep Mask Combo Set when I saw it. My order shipped quickly and arrived on the day it was promised. The first night that I had it, I had to try it out. The Combo set comes with the sleep mask and a set of ear plugs. The Sleep Mask has an adjustable band and velcro snaps. It fits very well. The mask itself is satin on the outside and is velvet on the inside. The ear plugs fit well. I sleep much better now that I have this Combo Set. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. I was chosen to receive the Sleep Mask Combo during a promotional period at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:efd7624b09bcf7ddd5063b76817514ac]] I own several different sleep masks and have owned many more over the years. None have the softness, versatility, convenience and quality of my Sleep More Sleep Mask. I love that it comes with a storage bag that also utilizes as a mini garment bag for washing your sleep mask. The straps are very soft and adjustable with a velcro closure and are multipurpose as they also conveniently hold the earplugs as well. The fabric closest to your eyes is soft and velvety while the outer fabric is silky soft and beautiful colors. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase... I travel often and my Sleep More Sleep Mask is a lifesaver!!</li>
            <li> I have been using my purple sleep mask for about 3 weeks now and I love it!  My bedroom is located near the bathroom in our house and there is always a light on.  My sleep mask makes it easier for me to fall asleep and stay asleep.  I&#x27;m not being constantly bothered by the light now.  I also love the ear plugs.  They are a good size and block out a lot of noise making it peaceful to sleep.  I would highly recommend this sleep mask to anyone.  It&#x27;s soft against your skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother you during the night.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased review. All opinions are my very own.</li>
            <li> I really like this sleep mask! The silk makes it so soft and comfortable to sleep in. My husband likes to have the tv on at night and this sleep mask really helps block the light of the TV. It does have an adjustable strap; which is great! I also really like that it has a spot in the strap for the ear plugs. The ear plugs that come with it helps dim down the sound; sometimes I don&#x27;t even hear the noise of the TV. It also comes with a bag to put the mask. I did receive this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I need.  Also, I had purchased one a few months back from a local cheapo store...the strap came out of the mask part the first night...I had to keep sewing it on, until it became so frayed, it was pointless.  I have worn it for 2 wk now and no problems.  I like the velco feature so that I can tighten it to the size of my head, as ones I&#x27;ve used previously end up too loose and slide all over.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye mask. It blocks light very well and I love the soft feel of it.  In addition, I love the color.</li>
            <li> Nice quality. Doesn&#x27;t fall off and has a spot to hold ear plugs.</li>
            <li> I have to use a sleep mask every night so I ordered this because I like the satin mask it wasnt at all what I had hoped. First of all it was very small, it barely covered my eyes. I still wore it a few nights and it tore. I would not recommend this for an adult but it might be ok for a child and not to be worn every night. I might be ok for traveling but I do not travel much.</li>
            <li> I like this sleep mask, but I definitely think some improvements can be made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The fabric of the mask is very soft and feels nice on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;- I love that it comes with a wash bad, which is great for storage also.&lt;br /&gt;- It blocks out light fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;- The ear plugs included are a great touch.&lt;br /&gt;- It stays on securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The mask is on the smaller side, so if your head is larger it may not fit well.&lt;br /&gt;- The strap that holds it on is rough on the skin and fairly uncomfortable. It made my head itch.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! So much better than sleeping with a blanket over my head! This is just what I needed and the color is my favorite. This is a must!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT sleeping mask.  The velcro fastening holds well and doesnt get in the way at all while I&#x27;m sleeping; it keeps out all the light but is light and thin (read: no slipping mask or sweating face); the color is a great purple.  So happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Works well...completely blocks out the light</li>
            <li> Gatear product.&lt;br /&gt;Excelent choice to help with sleep.&lt;br /&gt;High quality and Very fast delivery,&lt;br /&gt;The product exceeds my quality expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Monica</li>
            <li> sleep mask came in time, very nice color. Unfortunately mask is defective what is disappointing</li>
            <li> Who thought it would be so hard to find an adjustable sleep mask that was also big enough? I looked at a number of retail store and also purchased some sleep masks that turned out to be too small and not adjustable. The strap adjusts and is secured by the velcro. I liked this so much I ordered extra for a friend and two more to spare for myself</li>
            <li> I really like these alot i recieved these discounted to try and give my honest unbiased opinion... they are very soft cover the eyes great love the bag they came with...</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness.  Thank you for getting the purple and the pink.  Now my daughter wouldn&#x27;t have to fight me for the black one.  This mask is so much better than what we use to buy.  It is durable and no light comes in at the bottom of the eyes.</li>
            <li> The best investment I&#x27;ve made I now  have to place an alarm on to not sleep threw the whole day however this sleeping mask broke the first week on me I had to sew the strap back on</li>
            <li> This is made very well, the material is soft against my skin and is comfortable to wear, they include earplugs and a nice bag to store everything in. I had a problem with achieving total darkness but it wasn&#x27;t because of a defect but that I have a very small narrow nose and I couldn&#x27;t adjust it to fit tight enough around my nose to keep the light out. I was given this product for free for agreeing to try it. I believe it will be fine for most people, but if you have a very small nose you may have the same problem I did. It worked just fine for my husband and my son, but they both have long slender noses and it fit them very well and they both stated it was very comfortable and totally darkened the room for them</li>
            <li> Did not receive buy one get one free. I purchased two I am asks into different colors and only for tame. Very disappointed. I will change my review if I get the other masks by Thursday. These were ordered for a party on Friday.</li>
            <li> To my lover to buy, she is practical after noon sleep a lot, I should have bought a long time ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sleeping with those complimentary in-flight eye masks for the last 6 months. Love how it helps me to fall asleep quickly. I thought it&#x27;s about time for me to get a REAL sleep mask. I decided to give this one a try due to its excellent reviews on Amazon. However, I was really disappointed after sleeping with it for two nights. I like the quality and the color of this sleep mask but practically speaking it&#x27;s just not as comfortable as those cheapy sleep masks I get from flying. My hair would easily get caught in the velcro closure. The one banded design is not as comfortable as the two elastic bands in the back which allow you to position them the way you&#x27;d like especially that I like to sleep with my hair up instead of down. I&#x27;m surprised this is not a big issue for most female reviewers. Lastly, I also noticed a tear in the satin fabric near the nose bridge area.</li>
