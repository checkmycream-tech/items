            <li>No they are not the most superior in quality</li>
            <li>I will be honest and say that I have never used sepate brushes to apply a polish before.  </li>
            <li>They came with plastic tips over all the brushes, so the straight line brushes are kept perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started getting into painting my own nails and creating designs</li>
            <li>and so I need a set of my own and</li>
            <li>They made working with the gel nail polish very easy.  </li>
            <li>it makes it so much easier to have beautiful nails with this.</li>
            <li>These brushes get the job done just fine!  </li>
            <li>Most of the brushes had to be re-glued to their handles, bristles arrived already frayed and the paint off one of the brush handles is cracking off.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS NAIL BRUSH SET.  </li>
            <li>BUY ANOTHER SET :)</li>
            <li>Now the question is...what to do with so many brushes???</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a better product from anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its a must have :)</li>

            <li>I even bought three more for my Friends as gifts</li>
            <li>I love going to the salon</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews are NON VERIFIED that someone purchased them.</li>
            <li>I love designs people can make with them.</li>
            <li>I love how precise these get the details on my nails. :)</li>
            <li>This product shipped and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>easy on the wallet?</li>
            <li>They made the task seem so easy.</li>
            <li>Im a beginner when it comes to doing nails and these brushes are good enough to get the job done although I am sure there are better quality brushes out there</li>
            <li>a side note Shany asks you to review their products with 5 stars and sign up for their mailing list; for doing this they tell you that they will send you free samples....</li>
            <li>The brushes clean up easy with a dunk into nail polish remover and sweeping it on a paper towel.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I got it.</li>
            <li>They work really well and apply the colour very smoothly...</li>
            <li>I love these as a backup to my main set!</li>
            <li>I am learning so much and this set is great starting out!</li>
            <li>These nail brushes are so much better than the picture gives them credit for, all my brushes came nice and neat in a handy little bag; and they all looked very professional and well made.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to start using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using these brushes once they started falling apart; the cheap purple paint started coming off of them; and I had to super glue the heads back on most of them....</li>
            <li>I can do all sorts of fun nail art with these brushes.</li>
            <li>I love how the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li>These were definately worth every penny.</li>
            <li>With these brushes I can perfect my french nails and other designs that I would like to create on my nails!</li>
            <li>This brush set is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>finally i&#x27;m able to create different looks with one kit.</li>
            <li>This set is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>They look exactly like the pictures.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m either going to have to buy new ones or tape the handles and super glue</li>
            <li>Think I just might buy new ones that will last more than 2 uses without falling apart.</li>
            <li>Very good quality brushes I have used them a few times and had absolutely no problems with them.  </li>
            <li>I lightly wiggled the plaastic on the rest and the same thing.</li>
            <li>Some reviews seem very legitimate.</li>
            <li>I wanted the PURPLE Shany brand brushes in the pic, but instead recieved a set of cheap white brushes.</li>
            <li>and I really want to try to start doing acrylic.</li>
            <li>These brushes are not those who were seen in the picture, is more like an imitation, it does not show the brand logos Shany, I feel like I sold a dummy!</li>
            <li>For the longest time I was looking for a decent nail brush set.</li>
            <li>an they are very professional looking!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to do nail art.</li>
            <li>If I were professionally doing nails, I might go with something a little better...</li>
            <li>Definitely investing in some better brushes from a different seller next time.</li>
            <li>These look so pretty and simple to use.</li>
            <li>I hate paying so much to get my nails done, SO I&#x27;ve started doing my own at home, and these do just fine.</li>
            <li>The brushes are in a clear plastic pouch that I can use to store them in.  </li>
            <li>if you need to design something small on your face these brushes will do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>so small it can fit just about anywhere</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere else, and you get a ton of different brushes for various nail strokes and painting.</li>
            <li>UNLESS YOU EXPECT POOR QAULITY, FURTHER MORE SELLER DID NOT EVEN RESPOND</li>

            <li> Doing acryilc nails is what I have wanting to do for soo long!</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful when using brush cleaner to cleanse the bristles or the white paint will disolve off of the handle.</li>
            <li> when they came out of the little carry sleeve it comes with, two of the brush heads were loose enough to fall off</li>
            <li> the heads are coming off and if you get anything wet on the handles they turn sticky and the paint comes off.</li>
            <li> the only thing is the largest brush had a few brissles fall off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already thrown away 2 of the brushes due to loose metal bristle holders.</li>
            <li> by use 4 the finish on the wood is gone and the brushes are pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I chose the 3 star rating because the brushes I paid for &amp; expected aren&#x27;t the ones I recieved!</li>
            <li> I opened the small pouch it came in and took out the brushes.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED THE NAIL BRUSH SET IS SOOOO CHEAP</li>
            <li> I had to use crazy glue to glue the bristles back to the brush.</li>
            <li> IF I CAN GIVE NEGATIVE STARS</li>
            <li> ITS UNBELIEVABLE SOME OF THEM WERE EVEN BROKEN UPON ARRIVAL</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with nail art and</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I am skeptical.</li>
            <li> I thought they were going to be a bad buy</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the brushes a total of four times and they are already falling apart. Most of the brushes had to be re-glued to their handles, bristles arrived already frayed and the paint off one of the brush handles is cracking off. Definitely investing in some better brushes from a different seller next time.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS NAIL BRUSH SET.  USE ON MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND EVEN MYSELF.  WORKS GREAT.  GREAT PRICE AND I WILL DIFF. BUY ANOTHER SET :)</li>
            <li> These Brushes were an Awesome Buy...I thought they were going to be a bad buy but they were great love using these brushes for my nails! :-)</li>
            <li> This brush set is exactly what I was looking for.  good quality for the price.  Now the question is...what to do with so many brushes???</li>
            <li> These nail brushes are so much better than the picture gives them credit for, all my brushes came nice and neat in a handy little bag; and they all looked very professional and well made.

Save your money and buy a better product from anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note Shany asks you to review their products with 5 stars and sign up for their mailing list; for doing this they tell you that they will send you free samples.... they never do even after you email them.</li>
            <li> when they came out of the little carry sleeve it comes with, two of the brush heads were loose enough to fall off</li>
            <li> This product shipped and arrived very quickly. I was excited when I got it. I opened the small pouch it came in and took out the brushes. The bristles on the brush are covered with plastic tubing to prevent bending. Well, as I began to pull the plastic tubing off, the entire bristle portion detached itself from the handle. I lightly wiggled the plaastic on the rest and the same thing. I had to use crazy glue to glue the bristles back to the brush. I would nit recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have to say these are a great price for being nail brushes! I love the color and they are great! easy on the wallet? I think so! its a must have :)</li>
            <li> I hate paying so much to get my nails done, SO I&#x27;ve started doing my own at home, and these do just fine. If I were professionally doing nails, I might go with something a little better... But these work just great for me!</li>
            <li> finally i&#x27;m able to create different looks with one kit. you get so many brushes in this set. it makes it so much easier to have beautiful nails with this.</li>
            <li> This set is exactly what I needed. I can do all sorts of fun nail art with these brushes. So tiny that I can perfect even the smallest detail. And a great price on top of all that!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I love the color of it and the case rhey came in. I love how the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> This nail brush set has a nice purple brush and also comes with a great pouch. This would be a great pampering kit to use on my nails and give the salon effect. Love it alot!</li>
            <li> Im a beginner when it comes to doing nails and these brushes are good enough to get the job done although I am sure there are better quality brushes out there</li>
            <li> ive been trying to learn how to do my own acrylic nails and these brushes are awesome!!! an they are very professional looking!</li>
            <li> these brushes aregreat for detail work if you need to design something small on your face these brushes will do the job just fine. so small it can fit just about anywhere you will love this product i know i do</li>
            <li> These brushes get the job done just fine!  No they are not the most superior in quality but they are priced very reasonably, and for the money, the product is great!!!!  I love these as a backup to my main set!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes to use with the Shany gel nail polish. They worked good. They seem to be quality brushes.  They made working with the gel nail polish very easy.  I will be honest and say that I have never used sepate brushes to apply a polish before.  Of course I had never used gel nail polish before.  These brushes took a lot of the fear factor out of doing it. They made the task seem so easy. These were definately worth every penny. Linda W.</li>
            <li> I love the brush set. The brushes are in a clear plastic pouch that I can use to store them in.  They came with plastic tips over all the brushes, so the straight line brushes are kept perfect. They look exactly like the pictures.  Very good quality brushes I have used them a few times and had absolutely no problems with them.  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to do nail art. You get all the different size brushes for all your needs.</li>
            <li> so many brushes. Lol. Perfect for what i wanted and nice price as well. Could not ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started getting into painting my own nails and creating designs and so I figured I&#x27;d try these brushes. I love how precise these get the details on my nails. :)</li>
            <li> Shany has great colored tools! I am obsessed with nail art and this acrylic nail brush set has everything you need!</li>
            <li> IM A BEGINNER WHEN IT COMES TO CREATING DESIGNS ON MY NAILS BUT THESE BRUSHES MAKE IT SO EASY FOR ME!!! THEY ARE A GREAT QUALITY AND VERY EASY TO WORK WITH!! REBUY!!!</li>
            <li> Very good quality for a very good price you will not regret purchasing. I even bought three more for my Friends as gifts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you! Doing acryilc nails is what I have wanting to do for soo long! I&#x27;m in training and so I need a set of my own and this is it! I am learning so much and this set is great starting out! (so I have been told)</li>
            <li> All of these brushes are one of a kind! With these brushes I can perfect my french nails and other designs that I would like to create on my nails! With these brushes, I can do my nails in no time! :D</li>
            <li> THE SHANY NAIL BRUSH SET WAS NOT AS PICTURED,LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN FIND IT AT THE DOLLAR STORE, VERY DISAPPOINTED THE NAIL BRUSH SET IS SOOOO CHEAP ITS UNBELIEVABLE SOME OF THEM WERE EVEN BROKEN UPON ARRIVAL, DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU EXPECT POOR QAULITY, FURTHER MORE SELLER DID NOT EVEN RESPOND WHEN CONTACTED ABOUT THE MATTER. DISAPPOINTED AND WILL NOT BUY FROM SELLER AGAIN!!!!  IF I CAN GIVE NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD</li>
            <li> I love going to the salon but my wallet says do it yourself... this set has everything you need to (try!) and recreate your nail techs work.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I am skeptical. Most of the reviews are NON VERIFIED that someone purchased them. After looking through the reviews I see that they are  reviewing all Shany products. I believe that the reviews are from the seller using different names. Some reviews seem very legitimate. Now that you do not have to be a purchaser to review, BEWARE OF REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes and a nail art set and they just came today. I am loving them! The brushes clean up easy with a dunk into nail polish remover and sweeping it on a paper towel. The handles are not hand cramping which is a bonus to me. ty I will buy from Shany again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Since using these 3 times total the heads are coming off and if you get anything wet on the handles they turn sticky and the paint comes off. Wish I would have known that these we not white plastic and were wood painted with white. The friggin heads fall off all the time now. I&#x27;m either going to have to buy new ones or tape the handles and super glue the heads back on. Think I just might buy new ones that will last more than 2 uses without falling apart.</li>
            <li> I use these for body painting using acrylic colours or aqua colours. They work really well and apply the colour very smoothly...the only thing is the largest brush had a few brissles fall off but that may have been because of the amount i use it.</li>
            <li> I chose the 3 star rating because the brushes I paid for &amp; expected aren&#x27;t the ones I recieved! I wanted the PURPLE Shany brand brushes in the pic, but instead recieved a set of cheap white brushes. I have to be very careful when using brush cleaner to cleanse the bristles or the white paint will disolve off of the handle. I&#x27;ve already thrown away 2 of the brushes due to loose metal bristle holders. I wouldn&#x27;t buy, again.</li>
            <li> These look so pretty and simple to use.I&#x27;m just now starting to get into nails and I really want to try to start doing acrylic. I love designs people can make with them. I cannot wait to order this product.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I was looking for a decent nail brush set. and this is IT! You really can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere else, and you get a ton of different brushes for various nail strokes and painting. It&#x27;s AMAZING! I have a couple. I recommend to any nail guru or beginner.</li>
