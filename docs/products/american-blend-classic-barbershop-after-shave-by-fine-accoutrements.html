            <li>Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>Tiki lather is amazing!</li>
            <li>Fine makes awesome after shaves.</li>
            <li>They feel great on the skin and smell amazing.  </li>
            <li>As it stands, it makes an excellent follow up for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Fine makes good stuff, and while ideally I&#x27;d like to see them stick some botanicals and / or moisturizing additives in here</li>
            <li>the best, followed by Fresh Vetiver.</li>
            <li>At first, I was mildly impressed.</li>
            <li>Love the smell!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>But Fine has successfully incorporated the right amount for the perfect freshness blast without the watery eyes effect.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Pinaud Clubman guy but was convinced to purchase this after reading so many awesome reviews on the Wicked Edge subreddit and boy</li>
            <li>I have been happy with all of my purchases from Mr. Fine.  </li>
            <li>Either way, you&#x27;ll thank yourself when you see how great (dare I say - FINE?)</li>
            <li>If longevity is important to you and you like the scents, then these are a great value.</li>
            <li>liked it.</li>
            <li>If you own TDH, put something else on your face after you shave, and then squirt the TDH on after that.</li>
            <li>The kind of aftershave your kids get you for father&#x27;s day, but twice the price.</li>
            <li>I own one of each.</li>
            <li>I have never had a spontaneous comment on an after shave from anyone, ever.</li>
            <li>but I have been known to ask my wife on occasion who will give me her honest feedback.</li>
            <li>And these do smell as nice as a lot of the colognes out there.</li>
            <li>I warmly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor if your shave was wonderful then complement it with a Fine Aftershave,try them all and see if you don&#x27;t smile like the guy on the logo,enjoy!</li>
            <li>These splashes will give you a nice burn if that is what you&#x27;re looking for, and they all feel refreshing.</li>
            <li>Fine!</li>
            <li>Perfect balance of alcohol, not to strong, not too faint, perfect amount of fragrance leaves you with an amazing scent that will follow you throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I own the entire line of fine aftershaves and they are all awesome sauce.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, prefer original formula with less menthol but still a great product</li>
            <li>I am sure glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to go to barber shop with my grand pa</li>
            <li>so many of us enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love to put it on and the wife loves to smell it on me.</li>
            <li>Alcohol and menthol do nothing to make skin better.</li>
            <li>I love this this and use it every day, even when I don&#x27;t shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thinking it&#x27;s got ingredients that are found in most of today&#x27;s mid-tier aftershaves.  </li>
            <li>My most used aftershave.</li>
            <li>The coolness and scents they provide truly makes the finish of my shaves enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I do have a favorite</li>
            <li>To quote her, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
            <li>No doubt though I&#x27;m sure the ladies will love FV</li>
            <li>This stuff makes me feel like I&#x27;m riding a bald eagle through the grand finale of a 4th of July fireworks show.</li>
            <li>aftershave is a top quality aftershave</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s when things got interesting.</li>
            <li>a Grand &#x27;Ol</li>
            <li>Love the barbershop fragrance.</li>
            <li>On the top of my list.</li>
            <li>Scent OK bottle leaked during shipment.</li>
            <li>I love this aftershave.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better ones out there for this price.</li>
            <li>Just OK.</li>
            <li>It is a bit sweet but not overly so and strongly reminds me of a humidor or a smoke shop but in a good way.</li>
            <li>Even the menthol cooling effect is really just skin irritation that many find pleasant.</li>
            <li>own the Fresh Vetiver and the American Blend, both are excellent fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Fine Accoutrements&#x27; aftershave (I used the Italian Citrus) is an excellent alcohol based splash.</li>
            <li>I love what Mr. Fine is doing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Italian Citrus: Clean, fresh citrus scent that lasts for a good portion of the day.</li>
            <li>This aftershave has a pleasant and classic scent with notes of wood and tobacco.</li>
            <li>Aftershave smells very nice, it reminds me of an old aftershave my father used.  </li>
            <li>For me, my $X is higher, so I own TDH, Guerlain Vetiver, and Rive Gauche, but I would not pay Tom Ford $90 or Olivier Creed $250 for their products, so I own Fresh Vetiver and Platinum.</li>
            <li>Even if you love the scent of Terre D&#x27;Hermes, Fine&#x27;s variant does nothing to improve on the original, and lasts for like 45 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice bottle with a very useful stopper for getting the right amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see them try something more original, but what they have available now is just...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see them try something more original, but what they have available now is just...</li>
            <li>It splashes on cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Great barbershop scent, masculine but clean.</li>
            <li>will be trying another scent from Fine soon.</li>
            <li>I may eventually try Fine again if my supply ever dwindles.</li>
            <li>, I like Fine.</li>
            <li>I feel like a million bucks when I wear Fine.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Fine sampler pack.</li>
            <li>, this is what Fine is all about.</li>
            <li>Another winner from Fine</li>
            <li>Nice old school sent great finish for a close shave highly recommend.</li>
            <li>There are samplers sold on other sites(do a google), and that would be my best advice before purchasing a full bottle on a suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I really enjoy all Fine aftershave products.</li>
            <li>the best lesson is a little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of products I&#x27;ve tried over the years but these easily qualify as the most fun to wear as they are unique.  </li>
            <li>but it puts Clubman&#x27;s cheap plastic bottle to shame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, both American and Vetiver smell great just as the reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>American blend is a great smell, my wife likes platinum and the velvetier&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;Fine</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve discovered that Fine Accoutrements had an original formula in the flask style bottle, then changed their bottles to square shaped bottles with a re-formulation of additional menthol.</li>
            <li>the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles I reviewed are the square bottles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a unique scent, and boy did I find one.</li>
            <li>I even had a stripper more interested in smelling my face than giving me a lap dance.</li>
            <li>I think I like Clean Vetiver(slight detergent scent)</li>
            <li>I started out with the sampler of all four scents available on his website, and I must say they are all fantastic scents that linger just the right amount.</li>
            <li>Great for hot spring or especially summer days.</li>
            <li>Have received numerous complements from women saying how good I smell when I use this aftershave.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts a good portion of the day, not an obnoxious cologne strength but just enough to let you know</li>
            <li>A sweet but manly scent with hints of citrus fruits.</li>
            <li>I also bit because of the cool bottle.</li>
            <li>certainly doesn&#x27;t replace the scent of Clubman but is its own distinct product that I now enjoy using equally as much.</li>
            <li>I own all of Mr. Fine&#x27;s scents, including his now discontinued &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34;, and I feel I can say everything he makes will have a home on my shelf next to my razor and brush.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that he ships the product quickly.</li>
            <li>It came fairly quickly and some of the aftershave had some issues.</li>
            <li>In fact, the balance is so perfect that I wear American Blend as daily cologne, no need of another cologne.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>Brisk and cool and feels like you are fresh from the barber shop.</li>
            <li>After buying and using many aftershaves always looking at Fine Aftershaves I finally bought the Clean Vetiver and was blown away</li>
            <li>Contrarily, American has that old barbershop scent with licorice notes and might be classified by some as best for an older person.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I don&#x27;t find myself using these that much because they are strongly scented.</li>
            <li>In fact, I tend to dislike all strong menthol products because I find it covers the real scent.</li>
            <li>it is the best its long lasting yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Orange smells nice, but becomes less appealing to me as it settles in on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the Fine Snake Bite aftershave because of the unusual name.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The chosen models are carefully selected to be tasteful unique classics (no Acqua Di Gio or Burberry here), and the scent design work here is pretty good.</li>
            <li>and it dries down to a really unique and enjoyable scent with much more staying power than Clubman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true instant classic, and once you try it it&#x27;ll be in your rotation for good.</li>
            <li>Pro Raso White and Nivea Sensitive and Cooling balms are quite good, and they are all cheaper than Fine, but they do not smell like anything famous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These scents, as honestly described by the maker on the website, are meant to emulate well known male fragrances.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the Fresh Vetiver.</li>
            <li>The Fine American Classic After Shave has a nice scent and felt good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So to put # 3 another way, the main market for Fine splashes are guys who say \\&quot;heck</li>
            <li>When you splash your face with any of the Fine aftershave product you get to enter a particular world.</li>
            <li>I have found it goes on smelling pretty bold but fades within an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>as he does complex splashes with useful additives, though admittedly at a higher price point than Fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine accomplishes their mission, and they do it honestly and effectively.</li>
            <li>as he does complex splashes with useful additives, though admittedly at a higher price point than Fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine accomplishes their mission, and they do it honestly and effectively.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m partial to the Fresh Vetiver, but use all the scents weekly, and the wife never fails to let me know how great I smell as I get ready for work.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of smell with a hint menthol.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of menthol to soothe for 15 mins.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of menthol.</li>
            <li>Platinum is pretty loud and is the most youthful of the line.</li>
            <li>mix of water and alcohol is a great astringent without excessive sting or drying.</li>
            <li>Fine duplicates the fragrance notes pretty well, but the scent pyramid is pretty highly condensed, as it would need to be for something with a 5% fragrance</li>
            <li>The American Blend I most prefer with its more masculine scent however let me again say Both are GREAT long lasting scents.</li>
            <li>So, related to the points above, if you already own one or more of the model fragrances, don&#x27;t buy the related Fine aftershave.</li>
            <li>It is my current favorite.  </li>
            <li>If I splash it on, it will last for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Soothes and refreshes my face after a hot shave.</li>
            <li>It is more for a younger man and reminds me of some colognes worn during the 80s clubbing at the \\&quot;meat markets\\</li>
            <li>I first tried this aftershave when they came out with the XXX scent</li>
            <li>Love the entire lineup of products, American Blend being my favorite.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I felt a menthol tingle and a menthol scent that smells like cough drops</li>
            <li>/&gt;American blend has that barbershop-from-my-childhood smell, but just a touch different and more complexity than the Pinaud and other drugstore brands (kind of like Barbasol, but not chintzy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I contacted the commonly via email they were very apologetic and gave me two new sampler bottles to reconcile the problems.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of them are very good</li>
            <li>/&gt;t is much more complex than most aftershaves you can get at the store</li>
            <li>if you run out of your favorite, because then you&#x27;ll be forced to sell off limbs just to creatively cajole someone into giving up their half-used bottle of the stuff.</li>
            <li>Super clean and addictive fragrance!</li>
            <li>then please consider supporting this FINE American Entrepreneur and pickup this aftershave, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>I currently have 5 bottles of Fine</li>
            <li>Fine American Blend is a scent you&#x27;ve never smelled before and will smell again all day wondering where you know it from.  </li>
            <li>With Mr. Fine&#x27;s products, there&#x27;s only four ingredients-</li>
            <li>I have all the scents in the Fine line and each one is terrific.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain that this is why some reviewers find the scents fade fast, and some claim they linger.</li>
            <li>If you love classic barbershop scents and want a high quality American product then this is the ticket.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really feel like it had any skin healing properties either.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really an aftershave guy until I sampled these aftershaves.  </li>
            <li>If you have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Even if you douse yourself, you will not do much to increase the range.</li>
            <li>Way better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>There is something very dill and or sagey about this aftershave that just makes you want to wash it off</li>
            <li>&quot; haha.</li>
            <li>The lady of the house here really likes it</li>
            <li>I would rather use this than Osage Rub since that has too much menthol.</li>
            <li>Old school bottle and simple ingredients make this the perfect accompaniment to any traditional wet shavers bathroom.</li>
            <li>Then they went back to the original formula(less menthol) in the square bottle.</li>
            <li>Then changed the bottle back to the original flask style with</li>
            <li>It had a clean fresh from the barber sharp scent.</li>
            <li>leaves my face smooth, not too dry and the menthol in it really leaves my face refreshed.  </li>
            <li>The scent is complex and very enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Every scent I have purchased thus far has been stellar and the customer service you will get directly from Mr. Fine is second to none!</li>
            <li>(American Blend),Terre D&#x27;Hermes (Orange Noir), Guerlain Vetiver (Clean Vetiver), Tom Ford Grey Vetiver (Clean Vetiver), and Creed&#x27;s Aventus (Platinum).</li>
            <li>Its a little pricey for the cheap after shave variety, but in the end its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sting should be mild and brief followed by a cooling and tightening sensation.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite after American Blend.</li>
            <li>I spent the weekend with my brothers and turned them onto Fine products.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews it seemed the American Blend and Fresh Vetiver were the ones to try.</li>
            <li>Fine&#x27;s American blend has become a regular part of my shaving routine.</li>
            <li>A wonderful blend of essential oils, alcohol, menthol, and water without artificial colors.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be deceived by the low number of reviews, the product is new to amazon; fine aftershaves are very highly regarded in the wet shaving community (search it on reddit).</li>
            <li>Scent was a bit too strong and too long lasting.  </li>
            <li>(For those interested in the latter concept, try Barrister and Mann, artisan product not sold on Amazon (yet!)</li>
            <li>(For those interested in the latter concept, try Barrister and Mann, artisan product not sold on Amazon (yet!)</li>
            <li>I only try to use my other cheap after shaves so that I dont go through this stuff too fast.  </li>
            <li>The American blend had a barbershop-like scent, cool menthol tingle that hid the roughness from a rushed shave and just enough of a burn to point where I had nicked myself.</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance that sadly died 2 minutes after applying it.</li>
            <li>As a 50yr old man I prefer the American Blend over the Fresh Vetiver, the FV is just a little too sweet smelling for me at my age.</li>
            <li>For most users, the fragrance will last well less than an hour.</li>
            <li>Long lasting clean masculine scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a fine shave unless you finish with a Fine aftershave.  </li>
            <li>: great scent, not too bad of a burn, really sooths after a shave, chest eagle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering - its barbershop-like, a bit musky, powdery, woodsy, slightly citrusy, and clean.  </li>
            <li>When co-workers tell me I smell like an old man</li>
            <li>This is the old barbershop smell brought up to date.</li>
            <li>Suave, manly and classy.  </li>
            <li>a quality understated masculine aftershave.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable in any clothes besides my plus-sized Captain America get-up or an Uncle Sam suit (currently settling for a blue business suit with red tie).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the American Blend, Italian Citrus, and Fresh Vetiver.  </li>
            <li>I have three of the items (American Blend, Italian Citrus and Fresh Vetiver.).</li>
            <li>The combination of Tiki and Fine, left my face feeling smoother than at any other time.</li>
            <li>The ingredients work wonderfully but the fragrance of the american blend flat out stinks.</li>
            <li>Needless to say that the odor protruding from freshly clean shaving face seems to be meant for those who enjoy in the finer things in life.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want to spend even $15 to smell like sumptin, well, there&#x27;s always Pinaud and Old Spice, which are decent enough, but which lack menthol and smell comparatively ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The price does seem a bit high, considering the relative simplicity of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>They are actually quite &#x27;loud&#x27;, and if you don&#x27;t like loud cologne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they are the reformulation, or the original blend?</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and long lasting.</li>
            <li>The very pleasing scent lasts long enough without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>For those whose $X is $45, you can get anything in the line and get the smell of the higher price (briefly) for far less money.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, so I anticipate this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>I will be getting the other scents VERY soon, heck</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other aftershaves, never really knowing what&#x27;s in them or how they&#x27;ll feel on my freshly shaven face.</li>
            <li>I know not everyone wants to spend money on male fragrances, and I like the fact that a guy can smell like Rive Gauche or Aventus for less than $20.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li> As the label says on the bottle, this aftershave both smells and feels great,  </li>
            <li> Great deal, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I concede it did make my face feel great all day, thus it earns 3 stars.</li>

            <li> Very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> Tiki lather is amazing!</li>
            <li> Fine makes awesome after shaves.</li>
            <li> They feel great on the skin and smell amazing.  </li>
            <li> As it stands, it makes an excellent follow up for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Fine makes good stuff, and while ideally I&#x27;d like to see them stick some botanicals and / or moisturizing additives in here</li>
            <li> the best, followed by Fresh Vetiver.</li>
            <li> At first, I was mildly impressed.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> But Fine has successfully incorporated the right amount for the perfect freshness blast without the watery eyes effect.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Pinaud Clubman guy but was convinced to purchase this after reading so many awesome reviews on the Wicked Edge subreddit and boy</li>
            <li> I have been happy with all of my purchases from Mr. Fine.  </li>
            <li> Either way, you&#x27;ll thank yourself when you see how great (dare I say - FINE?)</li>
            <li> If longevity is important to you and you like the scents, then these are a great value.</li>
            <li> liked it.</li>
            <li> If you own TDH, put something else on your face after you shave, and then squirt the TDH on after that.</li>
            <li> The kind of aftershave your kids get you for father&#x27;s day, but twice the price.</li>
            <li> I own one of each.</li>
            <li> I have never had a spontaneous comment on an after shave from anyone, ever.</li>
            <li> but I have been known to ask my wife on occasion who will give me her honest feedback.</li>
            <li> And these do smell as nice as a lot of the colognes out there.</li>
            <li> I warmly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor if your shave was wonderful then complement it with a Fine Aftershave,try them all and see if you don&#x27;t smile like the guy on the logo,enjoy!</li>
            <li> These splashes will give you a nice burn if that is what you&#x27;re looking for, and they all feel refreshing.</li>
            <li> Fine!</li>
            <li> Perfect balance of alcohol, not to strong, not too faint, perfect amount of fragrance leaves you with an amazing scent that will follow you throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I own the entire line of fine aftershaves and they are all awesome sauce.  </li>
            <li> Awesome, prefer original formula with less menthol but still a great product</li>
            <li> I am sure glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to go to barber shop with my grand pa</li>
            <li> so many of us enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love to put it on and the wife loves to smell it on me.</li>
            <li> Alcohol and menthol do nothing to make skin better.</li>
            <li> I love this this and use it every day, even when I don&#x27;t shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thinking it&#x27;s got ingredients that are found in most of today&#x27;s mid-tier aftershaves.  </li>
            <li> My most used aftershave.</li>
            <li> The coolness and scents they provide truly makes the finish of my shaves enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I do have a favorite</li>
            <li> To quote her, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
            <li> No doubt though I&#x27;m sure the ladies will love FV</li>
            <li> This stuff makes me feel like I&#x27;m riding a bald eagle through the grand finale of a 4th of July fireworks show.</li>
            <li> aftershave is a top quality aftershave</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s when things got interesting.</li>
            <li> a Grand &#x27;Ol</li>
            <li> Love the barbershop fragrance.</li>
            <li> On the top of my list.</li>
            <li> Scent OK bottle leaked during shipment.</li>
            <li> I love this aftershave.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s better ones out there for this price.</li>
            <li> Just OK.</li>
            <li> It is a bit sweet but not overly so and strongly reminds me of a humidor or a smoke shop but in a good way.</li>
            <li> Even the menthol cooling effect is really just skin irritation that many find pleasant.</li>
            <li> own the Fresh Vetiver and the American Blend, both are excellent fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Fine Accoutrements&#x27; aftershave (I used the Italian Citrus) is an excellent alcohol based splash.</li>
            <li> I love what Mr. Fine is doing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Italian Citrus: Clean, fresh citrus scent that lasts for a good portion of the day.</li>
            <li> This aftershave has a pleasant and classic scent with notes of wood and tobacco.</li>
            <li> Aftershave smells very nice, it reminds me of an old aftershave my father used.  </li>
            <li> For me, my $X is higher, so I own TDH, Guerlain Vetiver, and Rive Gauche, but I would not pay Tom Ford $90 or Olivier Creed $250 for their products, so I own Fresh Vetiver and Platinum.</li>
            <li> Even if you love the scent of Terre D&#x27;Hermes, Fine&#x27;s variant does nothing to improve on the original, and lasts for like 45 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> Comes in a nice bottle with a very useful stopper for getting the right amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see them try something more original, but what they have available now is just...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see them try something more original, but what they have available now is just...</li>
            <li> It splashes on cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Great barbershop scent, masculine but clean.</li>
            <li> will be trying another scent from Fine soon.</li>
            <li> I may eventually try Fine again if my supply ever dwindles.</li>
            <li> , I like Fine.</li>
            <li> I feel like a million bucks when I wear Fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Fine sampler pack.</li>
            <li> , this is what Fine is all about.</li>
            <li> Another winner from Fine</li>
            <li> Nice old school sent great finish for a close shave highly recommend.</li>
            <li> There are samplers sold on other sites(do a google), and that would be my best advice before purchasing a full bottle on a suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I really enjoy all Fine aftershave products.</li>
            <li> the best lesson is a little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of products I&#x27;ve tried over the years but these easily qualify as the most fun to wear as they are unique.  </li>
            <li> but it puts Clubman&#x27;s cheap plastic bottle to shame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , both American and Vetiver smell great just as the reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> American blend is a great smell, my wife likes platinum and the velvetier&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;Fine</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve discovered that Fine Accoutrements had an original formula in the flask style bottle, then changed their bottles to square shaped bottles with a re-formulation of additional menthol.</li>
            <li> the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles I reviewed are the square bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a unique scent, and boy did I find one.</li>
            <li> I even had a stripper more interested in smelling my face than giving me a lap dance.</li>
            <li> I think I like Clean Vetiver(slight detergent scent)</li>
            <li> I started out with the sampler of all four scents available on his website, and I must say they are all fantastic scents that linger just the right amount.</li>
            <li> Great for hot spring or especially summer days.</li>
            <li> Have received numerous complements from women saying how good I smell when I use this aftershave.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a good portion of the day, not an obnoxious cologne strength but just enough to let you know</li>
            <li> A sweet but manly scent with hints of citrus fruits.</li>
            <li> I also bit because of the cool bottle.</li>
            <li> certainly doesn&#x27;t replace the scent of Clubman but is its own distinct product that I now enjoy using equally as much.</li>
            <li> I own all of Mr. Fine&#x27;s scents, including his now discontinued &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34;, and I feel I can say everything he makes will have a home on my shelf next to my razor and brush.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that he ships the product quickly.</li>
            <li> It came fairly quickly and some of the aftershave had some issues.</li>
            <li> In fact, the balance is so perfect that I wear American Blend as daily cologne, no need of another cologne.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> Brisk and cool and feels like you are fresh from the barber shop.</li>
            <li> After buying and using many aftershaves always looking at Fine Aftershaves I finally bought the Clean Vetiver and was blown away</li>
            <li> Contrarily, American has that old barbershop scent with licorice notes and might be classified by some as best for an older person.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t find myself using these that much because they are strongly scented.</li>
            <li> In fact, I tend to dislike all strong menthol products because I find it covers the real scent.</li>
            <li> it is the best its long lasting yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Orange smells nice, but becomes less appealing to me as it settles in on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the Fine Snake Bite aftershave because of the unusual name.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The chosen models are carefully selected to be tasteful unique classics (no Acqua Di Gio or Burberry here), and the scent design work here is pretty good.</li>
            <li> and it dries down to a really unique and enjoyable scent with much more staying power than Clubman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true instant classic, and once you try it it&#x27;ll be in your rotation for good.</li>
            <li> Pro Raso White and Nivea Sensitive and Cooling balms are quite good, and they are all cheaper than Fine, but they do not smell like anything famous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These scents, as honestly described by the maker on the website, are meant to emulate well known male fragrances.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the Fresh Vetiver.</li>
            <li> The Fine American Classic After Shave has a nice scent and felt good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So to put # 3 another way, the main market for Fine splashes are guys who say \\&quot;heck</li>
            <li> When you splash your face with any of the Fine aftershave product you get to enter a particular world.</li>
            <li> I have found it goes on smelling pretty bold but fades within an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> as he does complex splashes with useful additives, though admittedly at a higher price point than Fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine accomplishes their mission, and they do it honestly and effectively.</li>
            <li> as he does complex splashes with useful additives, though admittedly at a higher price point than Fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine accomplishes their mission, and they do it honestly and effectively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m partial to the Fresh Vetiver, but use all the scents weekly, and the wife never fails to let me know how great I smell as I get ready for work.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of smell with a hint menthol.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of menthol to soothe for 15 mins.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of menthol.</li>
            <li> Platinum is pretty loud and is the most youthful of the line.</li>
            <li> mix of water and alcohol is a great astringent without excessive sting or drying.</li>
            <li> Fine duplicates the fragrance notes pretty well, but the scent pyramid is pretty highly condensed, as it would need to be for something with a 5% fragrance</li>
            <li> The American Blend I most prefer with its more masculine scent however let me again say Both are GREAT long lasting scents.</li>
            <li> So, related to the points above, if you already own one or more of the model fragrances, don&#x27;t buy the related Fine aftershave.</li>
            <li> It is my current favorite.  </li>
            <li> If I splash it on, it will last for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Soothes and refreshes my face after a hot shave.</li>
            <li> It is more for a younger man and reminds me of some colognes worn during the 80s clubbing at the \\&quot;meat markets\\</li>
            <li> I first tried this aftershave when they came out with the XXX scent</li>
            <li> Love the entire lineup of products, American Blend being my favorite.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I felt a menthol tingle and a menthol scent that smells like cough drops</li>
            <li> /&gt;American blend has that barbershop-from-my-childhood smell, but just a touch different and more complexity than the Pinaud and other drugstore brands (kind of like Barbasol, but not chintzy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I contacted the commonly via email they were very apologetic and gave me two new sampler bottles to reconcile the problems.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of them are very good</li>
            <li> /&gt;t is much more complex than most aftershaves you can get at the store</li>
            <li> if you run out of your favorite, because then you&#x27;ll be forced to sell off limbs just to creatively cajole someone into giving up their half-used bottle of the stuff.</li>
            <li> Super clean and addictive fragrance!</li>
            <li> then please consider supporting this FINE American Entrepreneur and pickup this aftershave, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I currently have 5 bottles of Fine</li>
            <li> Fine American Blend is a scent you&#x27;ve never smelled before and will smell again all day wondering where you know it from.  </li>
            <li> With Mr. Fine&#x27;s products, there&#x27;s only four ingredients-</li>
            <li> I have all the scents in the Fine line and each one is terrific.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain that this is why some reviewers find the scents fade fast, and some claim they linger.</li>
            <li> If you love classic barbershop scents and want a high quality American product then this is the ticket.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really feel like it had any skin healing properties either.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really an aftershave guy until I sampled these aftershaves.  </li>
            <li> If you have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Even if you douse yourself, you will not do much to increase the range.</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> There is something very dill and or sagey about this aftershave that just makes you want to wash it off</li>
            <li> &quot; haha.</li>
            <li> The lady of the house here really likes it</li>
            <li> I would rather use this than Osage Rub since that has too much menthol.</li>
            <li> Old school bottle and simple ingredients make this the perfect accompaniment to any traditional wet shavers bathroom.</li>
            <li> Then they went back to the original formula(less menthol) in the square bottle.</li>
            <li> Then changed the bottle back to the original flask style with</li>
            <li> It had a clean fresh from the barber sharp scent.</li>
            <li> leaves my face smooth, not too dry and the menthol in it really leaves my face refreshed.  </li>
            <li> The scent is complex and very enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Every scent I have purchased thus far has been stellar and the customer service you will get directly from Mr. Fine is second to none!</li>
            <li> (American Blend),Terre D&#x27;Hermes (Orange Noir), Guerlain Vetiver (Clean Vetiver), Tom Ford Grey Vetiver (Clean Vetiver), and Creed&#x27;s Aventus (Platinum).</li>
            <li> Its a little pricey for the cheap after shave variety, but in the end its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sting should be mild and brief followed by a cooling and tightening sensation.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite after American Blend.</li>
            <li> I spent the weekend with my brothers and turned them onto Fine products.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews it seemed the American Blend and Fresh Vetiver were the ones to try.</li>
            <li> Fine&#x27;s American blend has become a regular part of my shaving routine.</li>
            <li> A wonderful blend of essential oils, alcohol, menthol, and water without artificial colors.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be deceived by the low number of reviews, the product is new to amazon; fine aftershaves are very highly regarded in the wet shaving community (search it on reddit).</li>
            <li> Scent was a bit too strong and too long lasting.  </li>
            <li> (For those interested in the latter concept, try Barrister and Mann, artisan product not sold on Amazon (yet!)</li>
            <li> (For those interested in the latter concept, try Barrister and Mann, artisan product not sold on Amazon (yet!)</li>
            <li> I only try to use my other cheap after shaves so that I dont go through this stuff too fast.  </li>
            <li> The American blend had a barbershop-like scent, cool menthol tingle that hid the roughness from a rushed shave and just enough of a burn to point where I had nicked myself.</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance that sadly died 2 minutes after applying it.</li>
            <li> As a 50yr old man I prefer the American Blend over the Fresh Vetiver, the FV is just a little too sweet smelling for me at my age.</li>
            <li> For most users, the fragrance will last well less than an hour.</li>
            <li> Long lasting clean masculine scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a fine shave unless you finish with a Fine aftershave.  </li>
            <li> : great scent, not too bad of a burn, really sooths after a shave, chest eagle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering - its barbershop-like, a bit musky, powdery, woodsy, slightly citrusy, and clean.  </li>
            <li> When co-workers tell me I smell like an old man</li>
            <li> This is the old barbershop smell brought up to date.</li>
            <li> Suave, manly and classy.  </li>
            <li> a quality understated masculine aftershave.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable in any clothes besides my plus-sized Captain America get-up or an Uncle Sam suit (currently settling for a blue business suit with red tie).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the American Blend, Italian Citrus, and Fresh Vetiver.  </li>
            <li> I have three of the items (American Blend, Italian Citrus and Fresh Vetiver.).</li>
            <li> The combination of Tiki and Fine, left my face feeling smoother than at any other time.</li>
            <li> The ingredients work wonderfully but the fragrance of the american blend flat out stinks.</li>
            <li> Needless to say that the odor protruding from freshly clean shaving face seems to be meant for those who enjoy in the finer things in life.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want to spend even $15 to smell like sumptin, well, there&#x27;s always Pinaud and Old Spice, which are decent enough, but which lack menthol and smell comparatively ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The price does seem a bit high, considering the relative simplicity of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> They are actually quite &#x27;loud&#x27;, and if you don&#x27;t like loud cologne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they are the reformulation, or the original blend?</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The very pleasing scent lasts long enough without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> For those whose $X is $45, you can get anything in the line and get the smell of the higher price (briefly) for far less money.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, so I anticipate this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I will be getting the other scents VERY soon, heck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other aftershaves, never really knowing what&#x27;s in them or how they&#x27;ll feel on my freshly shaven face.</li>
            <li> I know not everyone wants to spend money on male fragrances, and I like the fact that a guy can smell like Rive Gauche or Aventus for less than $20.</li>
            <li> Both are long lasting scents</li>
            <li> long lasting.</li>
            <li> But in my opinion they have overcome the short ingredient list with surprisingly complex and head-turning fragrances that harness classic masculinity.</li>
            <li> you are a wet shave addict or simply looking to expand your scent collection</li>
            <li> As for me, I like the scent and as long as it is not offensive to others,  </li>
            <li> Not very heavy after a few minutes .</li>
            <li> me either, but after splashing on little Italian Citrus I feel as I&#x27;ve been transported there, suddenly wearing a striped shirt while pushing a gondola and speaking something that sounds like lines from a Godfather film.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have about this aftershave is the fact that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Or cup the palm of a hand, fill the little hollow space in the middle with liquid.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not that bad&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> or so post-shave, and the scent only very slightly lingers throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> All five scents that I have are far from subtle and not really for me.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and masculine.  </li>
            <li> The scent stays with me for a long time and because the ingredients are few  not worried about a ton of garbage that I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> Subtle barbershop fragrance that is deceptively long lasting.</li>
            <li> These products are not ideal for dry / sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The women go crazy for Fresh Vetiver.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still waiting for the other product to ship!  </li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do, tight and tone without a scent, but I like their scents, unless you work with someone with allergies and complain about the scent, I&#x27;d rather have the scented.</li>
            <li> Buy a few.  </li>
            <li> I am not a huge menthol fan.</li>
            <li> The sting is not that bad at all, especially if you rub your hands together and wait a second to apply it to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not appropriate for me.</li>
            <li> They may not make it worse if you are tough skinned or use a moisturizer after the splash, but these definitely will not \\&quot;soothe\\&quot; or \\&quot;moisturize\\&quot; your skin.</li>
            <li> Before I could put the towel back on the rack, my chest hair shot violently from their respective pours.</li>
            <li> my shave den (at least how I like to imagine it</li>
            <li> I mean close to 24hr</li>
            <li> I mean no remnants at all.</li>
            <li> So even though these aftershaves are a little expensive you could save money just because you wouldn&#x27;t need a cologne.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s also this little splash of vitality that is insufflated in your numb body in the morning, and I call it THE MENTHOL FACTOR.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, menthol scent is gone but freshness is still there and fragrance blooms like a crazy horse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for other people, I feel like it would be creepy or weird to randomly lean in and ask people what they think.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious just buy it you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> , I know that&#x27;s unlikely to happen at this price point.</li>
            <li> you wwon&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> When I \\&quot;finish\\&quot; there are faint sounds of cannons and fireworks, which takes away any sense of subtlety.</li>
            <li> If it stings a lot, you have given yourself a bad shave.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit drying but not too bad</li>
            <li> but the sting isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> For very cold or windy days, or when I&#x27;ve managed to give myself a bad razorburn, I&#x27;d skip this one in favor of a balm or gel.</li>
            <li> This aftershave is a winner, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it</li>
            <li> the the price these are and for the quality and endurance you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get some today, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you love classic barbershop scents and want a high quality American product then this is the ticket. I am a loyal Pinaud Clubman guy but was convinced to purchase this after reading so many awesome reviews on the Wicked Edge subreddit and boy I am sure glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly doesn&#x27;t replace the scent of Clubman but is its own distinct product that I now enjoy using equally as much. It comes in a quality vintage style glass flask which looks great on my shaving shelf. I hate to say it but it puts Clubman&#x27;s cheap plastic bottle to shame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t is much more complex than most aftershaves you can get at the store and it dries down to a really unique and enjoyable scent with much more staying power than Clubman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my face smooth, not too dry and the menthol in it really leaves my face refreshed.  The sting is not that bad at all, especially if you rub your hands together and wait a second to apply it to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a wet shave addict or simply looking to expand your scent collection then please consider supporting this FINE American Entrepreneur and pickup this aftershave, you won&#x27;t regret it. Every scent I have purchased thus far has been stellar and the customer service you will get directly from Mr. Fine is second to none!</li>
            <li> Scent was a bit too strong and too long lasting.  When co-workers tell me I smell like an old man, that&#x27;s enough for me to not use it.  Didn&#x27;t really feel like it had any skin healing properties either.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Subtle barbershop fragrance that is deceptively long lasting.Does an excellent job of cooling your face after shaving. Have received numerous complements from women saying how good I smell when I use this aftershave.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great.  It is my current favorite.  I only try to use my other cheap after shaves so that I dont go through this stuff too fast.  Its a little pricey for the cheap after shave variety, but in the end its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying another scent from Fine soon.</li>
            <li> I used to go to barber shop with my grand pa ( I am 70 now ) reminds me of those Saturdays reading Boy&#x27;s Life and National Geographic, with feet hanging off chair and listening to the men talk. Brisk and cool and feels like you are fresh from the barber shop.</li>
            <li> I currently have 5 bottles of Fine and I&#x27;d have to say these can be used as cologne. If I splash it on, it will last for most of the day. They are actually quite &#x27;loud&#x27;, and if you don&#x27;t like loud cologne the best lesson is a little goes a loooong way. These splashes will give you a nice burn if that is what you&#x27;re looking for, and they all feel refreshing. The alcohol will sterilize as well and contribute to the tingle so many of us enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is subjective of course and here are my preferences...I think I like Clean Vetiver(slight detergent scent) the best, followed by Fresh Vetiver. Platinum is pretty loud and is the most youthful of the line. Contrarily, American has that old barbershop scent with licorice notes and might be classified by some as best for an older person. Orange smells nice, but becomes less appealing to me as it settles in on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t find myself using these that much because they are strongly scented. All five scents that I have are far from subtle and not really for me. If longevity is important to you and you like the scents, then these are a great value. There are samplers sold on other sites(do a google), and that would be my best advice before purchasing a full bottle on a suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 11/2015: I&#x27;ve discovered that Fine Accoutrements had an original formula in the flask style bottle, then changed their bottles to square shaped bottles with a re-formulation of additional menthol. Then they went back to the original formula(less menthol) in the square bottle. Then changed the bottle back to the original flask style with the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles I reviewed are the square bottles. I&#x27;m not sure if they are the reformulation, or the original blend? I&#x27;m fairly certain that this is why some reviewers find the scents fade fast, and some claim they linger. I may eventually try Fine again if my supply ever dwindles. This is something to keep in mind while reading all of these reviews, as there are different variations of the same aftershave.ions of the same aftershave.</li>
            <li> they must have in any shave collection. Nice old school sent great finish for a close shave highly recommend. If you&#x27;re curious just buy it you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> Fine American Blend is a scent you&#x27;ve never smelled before and will smell again all day wondering where you know it from.  It&#x27;s a true instant classic, and once you try it it&#x27;ll be in your rotation for good.</li>
            <li> The Fine American Classic After Shave has a nice scent and felt good.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it. Wife thought it was so-so. ~ The Boss</li>
            <li> On of the best scents I&#x27;ve ever owned. This is the old barbershop smell brought up to date. Love to put it on and the wife loves to smell it on me. Reasonable price and long lasting. Go for it.</li>
            <li> This is awesome sauce!  Great product from a great company! Buy it. Any of them !</li>
            <li> Great barbershop scent, masculine but clean. Comes in a nice bottle with a very useful stopper for getting the right amount. You don&#x27;t need much, so I anticipate this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really an aftershave guy until I sampled these aftershaves.  I&#x27;ve used the American Blend, Italian Citrus, and Fresh Vetiver.  They feel great on the skin and smell amazing.  The scent lasts a good portion of the day, not an obnoxious cologne strength but just enough to let you know it&#x27;s there.  I can&#x27;t recommend these enough.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a bottle...or four.</li>
            <li> 1) This is an aftershave splash. For most users, the fragrance will last well less than an hour. If you have very oily skin and / or you douse yourself, you may get two hours. If you want to smell like something 4 or 8 hours after you use a product, get an EDT, not aftershave. Similarly, this does not project well, maybe a couple inches from your skin. Even if you douse yourself, you will not do much to increase the range. Again, if you want the folks at the club to smell you from 5 feet away, get an EDT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) These scents, as honestly described by the maker on the website, are meant to emulate well known male fragrances. The models (and related Fibe scents) are: YSL Rive Gauche PH (American Blend),Terre D&#x27;Hermes (Orange Noir), Guerlain Vetiver (Clean Vetiver), Tom Ford Grey Vetiver (Clean Vetiver), and Creed&#x27;s Aventus (Platinum). Snake Bite is unscented menthol, and Italian Citrus is no longer mentioned on the website, so no idea what that&#x27;s supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) So, related to the points above, if you already own one or more of the model fragrances, don&#x27;t buy the related Fine aftershave. Even if you love the scent of Terre D&#x27;Hermes, Fine&#x27;s variant does nothing to improve on the original, and lasts for like 45 minutes or so. If you own TDH, put something else on your face after you shave, and then squirt the TDH on after that. No need to duplicate the $50 EDT with a separate $15 aftershave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) So to put # 3 another way, the main market for Fine splashes are guys who say \\&quot;heck no, I would never spend $X amount on smelling like sumptin\\&quot;. For every dude, the X variable will be different. For those whose $X is $45, you can get anything in the line and get the smell of the higher price (briefly) for far less money. For me, my $X is higher, so I own TDH, Guerlain Vetiver, and Rive Gauche, but I would not pay Tom Ford $90 or Olivier Creed $250 for their products, so I own Fresh Vetiver and Platinum. This way, I can smell like smoky pineapple (briefly) for a fraction of the cost of the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chosen models are carefully selected to be tasteful unique classics (no Acqua Di Gio or Burberry here), and the scent design work here is pretty good. Fine duplicates the fragrance notes pretty well, but the scent pyramid is pretty highly condensed, as it would need to be for something with a 5% fragrance concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend even $15 to smell like sumptin, well, there&#x27;s always Pinaud and Old Spice, which are decent enough, but which lack menthol and smell comparatively ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) These products are not ideal for dry / sensitive skin. Alcohol and menthol do nothing to make skin better. They may not make it worse if you are tough skinned or use a moisturizer after the splash, but these definitely will not \\&quot;soothe\\&quot; or \\&quot;moisturize\\&quot; your skin. Even the menthol cooling effect is really just skin irritation that many find pleasant. If you want healthier and / or moister skin, you need to use a balm or supplement your splash with a moisturizer. Pro Raso White and Nivea Sensitive and Cooling balms are quite good, and they are all cheaper than Fine, but they do not smell like anything famous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) How to apply: use a teaspoonful. Or cup the palm of a hand, fill the little hollow space in the middle with liquid. Rub your hands together for 3 seconds, and then turn your palms up for 4 seconds to air the alcohol. Then apply. If it stings a lot, you have given yourself a bad shave. The sting should be mild and brief followed by a cooling and tightening sensation. You should not be howling like Macaulay Culkin upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So given all the above, I like Fine. I know not everyone wants to spend money on male fragrances, and I like the fact that a guy can smell like Rive Gauche or Aventus for less than $20. Fine makes good stuff, and while ideally I&#x27;d like to see them stick some botanicals and / or moisturizing additives in here, I know that&#x27;s unlikely to happen at this price point. (For those interested in the latter concept, try Barrister and Mann, artisan product not sold on Amazon (yet!) as he does complex splashes with useful additives, though admittedly at a higher price point than Fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine accomplishes their mission, and they do it honestly and effectively. I&#x27;d like to see them try something more original, but what they have available now is just... Fine!ikely to happen at this price point. (For those interested in the latter concept, try Barrister and Mann, artisan product not sold on Amazon (yet!) as he does complex splashes with useful additives, though admittedly at a higher price point than Fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine accomplishes their mission, and they do it honestly and effectively. I&#x27;d like to see them try something more original, but what they have available now is just... Fine!</li>
            <li> I love this this and use it every day, even when I don&#x27;t shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own the Fresh Vetiver and the American Blend, both are excellent fragrances.  Vetiver has an eye-opening smell, great for sunny mornings.  My wife &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t mind it&amp;#34; which is actually a resounding endorsement given her sensitivity to fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American blend has that barbershop-from-my-childhood smell, but just a touch different and more complexity than the Pinaud and other drugstore brands (kind of like Barbasol, but not chintzy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no frills to this aftershave.  It&#x27;s alcohol, menthol, and fragrance.  So don&#x27;t buy it thinking it&#x27;s got ingredients that are found in most of today&#x27;s mid-tier aftershaves.  They market it as an old-school, bracing aftershave and that&#x27;s what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price does seem a bit high, considering the relative simplicity of the ingredients.  But in my opinion they have overcome the short ingredient list with surprisingly complex and head-turning fragrances that harness classic masculinity.</li>
            <li> The kind of aftershave your kids get you for father&#x27;s day, but twice the price.</li>
            <li> My most used aftershave. It had a clean fresh from the barber sharp scent.</li>
            <li> I own the entire line of fine aftershaves and they are all awesome sauce.  &amp;#60;---True story.</li>
            <li> It is what it says!  Quality ingredients, great package.  I spent the weekend with my brothers and turned them onto Fine products.  If you use aftershave this should definitely be in your shave den.</li>
            <li> Aftershave smells very nice, it reminds me of an old aftershave my father used.  I enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> I own all of Mr. Fine&#x27;s scents, including his now discontinued &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34;, and I feel I can say everything he makes will have a home on my shelf next to my razor and brush. I&#x27;ve tried other aftershaves, never really knowing what&#x27;s in them or how they&#x27;ll feel on my freshly shaven face. With Mr. Fine&#x27;s products, there&#x27;s only four ingredients- water, alcohol, menthol, and essential oils.  The alcohol acts as an astringent, sterilizing any tiny cuts I might have; the water stops any burn from the alcohol, the menthol cools and soothes the skin, and the mix of  essential oils leaves me smelling like a million bucks the rest of the day. I&#x27;m partial to the Fresh Vetiver, but use all the scents weekly, and the wife never fails to let me know how great I smell as I get ready for work.</li>
            <li> I have all the scents in the Fine line and each one is terrific.  Suave, manly and classy.  I feel like a million bucks when I wear Fine.</li>
            <li> After years of using Pinauld, this is a gift from the gods!  Way better than I expected.  Soothes and refreshes my face after a hot shave.</li>
            <li> The ingredients work wonderfully but the fragrance of the american blend flat out stinks. There is something very dill and or sagey about this aftershave that just makes you want to wash it off</li>
            <li> I really enjoy all Fine aftershave products. This pairs well with any barbershops scent.  Get it.</li>
            <li> Awesome, prefer original formula with less menthol but still a great product</li>
            <li> I started out with the sampler of all four scents available on his website, and I must say they are all fantastic scents that linger just the right amount. Don&#x27;t be deceived by the low number of reviews, the product is new to amazon; fine aftershaves are very highly regarded in the wet shaving community (search it on reddit).</li>
            <li> The scent is great I own one of each. A great aftershave give them a try you wwon&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great.  Slap on your face after a shave, and feel the soothing sting.  Excellent aftershave... Buy it.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with all of my purchases from Mr. Fine.  I have three of the items (American Blend, Italian Citrus and Fresh Vetiver.). I like how I feel when I put on each of the aftershaves. The coolness and scents they provide truly makes the finish of my shaves enjoyable. I do have a favorite and it&#x27;s the Fresh Vetiver. His product line is growing and that by no means implies that the quality of the products are diminishing.  I rotate my aftershaves so they have lasted quite a while.  There are a lot of products I&#x27;ve tried over the years but these easily qualify as the most fun to wear as they are unique.  I imagine there will come a day when I&#x27;m in a department store and find these products in the glass cases. I like the fact that he ships the product quickly. I ordered his product on the same day as another and I&#x27;m still waiting for the other product to ship!  So, to sum up- I love what Mr. Fine is doing and I can&#x27;t wait to see and use the products he develops in the future. Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> Fine Accoutrements&#x27; aftershave (I used the Italian Citrus) is an excellent alcohol based splash. The scent is complex and very enjoyable. It lasted for several hours on me. In that regard it resembles an eau de cologne rather than an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mix of water and alcohol is a great astringent without excessive sting or drying. I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5 simply because it doesn&#x27;t contain any additional moisturizing or conditioning agents. As it stands, it makes an excellent follow up for a comfortable shave. For very cold or windy days, or when I&#x27;ve managed to give myself a bad razorburn, I&#x27;d skip this one in favor of a balm or gel.</li>
            <li> Perfect . Not very heavy after a few minutes . Girlfriend approves.</li>
            <li> Buy a few.  Buy them all.  Either way, you&#x27;ll thank yourself when you see how great (dare I say - FINE?) your face will feel after a  shave.  Just be forewarned: you&#x27;ll harrumph around like Scrooge if you run out of your favorite, because then you&#x27;ll be forced to sell off limbs just to creatively cajole someone into giving up their half-used bottle of the stuff. So don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Fine makes awesome after shaves. This is my second favorite after American Blend. Just the right amount of smell with a hint menthol.</li>
            <li> Fine&#x27;s American blend has become a regular part of my shaving routine. It can be a bit drying but not too bad and it cools like it should. This aftershave has a pleasant and classic scent with notes of wood and tobacco. It is a bit sweet but not overly so and strongly reminds me of a humidor or a smoke shop but in a good way. I have never had a spontaneous comment on an after shave from anyone, ever. I don&#x27;t know why this is but I have been known to ask my wife on occasion who will give me her honest feedback. In this case, she is indifferent to this. To quote her, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s not my favorite but it&#x27;s really not that bad&amp;#34;. As for other people, I feel like it would be creepy or weird to randomly lean in and ask people what they think. As for me, I like the scent and as long as it is not offensive to others,  then I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews it seemed the American Blend and Fresh Vetiver were the ones to try. So here are my thoughts on both, both American and Vetiver smell great just as the reviewers have said. Both are long lasting scents I mean close to 24hr long lasting. So even though these aftershaves are a little expensive you could save money just because you wouldn&#x27;t need a cologne. And these do smell as nice as a lot of the colognes out there. As a 50yr old man I prefer the American Blend over the Fresh Vetiver, the FV is just a little too sweet smelling for me at my age. It is more for a younger man and reminds me of some colognes worn during the 80s clubbing at the \\&quot;meat markets\\&quot; haha. No doubt though I&#x27;m sure the ladies will love FV it&#x27;s just not appropriate for me. The American Blend I most prefer with its more masculine scent however let me again say Both are GREAT long lasting scents. Some of the best aftershaves I have tried. If you like trying out aftershaves I also recommend a German one called Echt Kolnisch Wasser  [Amazon search of 4711 will find it for you] a quality understated masculine aftershave.</li>
            <li> As the label says on the bottle, this aftershave both smells and feels great,  The lady of the house here really likes it and she is quite picky with these kinds of things.  The scent is not overpowering - its barbershop-like, a bit musky, powdery, woodsy, slightly citrusy, and clean.  It has just the right amount of menthol to soothe for 15 mins. or so post-shave, and the scent only very slightly lingers throughout the day.  Not offensive in the slightest and you can really splash it on heavy.  Very sophisticated for the price- great product and excellent value.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes me feel like I&#x27;m riding a bald eagle through the grand finale of a 4th of July fireworks show. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Fine sampler pack. It came fairly quickly and some of the aftershave had some issues. When I contacted the commonly via email they were very apologetic and gave me two new sampler bottles to reconcile the problems.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of them are very good only one I don&#x27;t care for and that&#x27;s the snake bite. It does what it is supposed to do, tight and tone without a scent, but I like their scents, unless you work with someone with allergies and complain about the scent, I&#x27;d rather have the scented. American blend is a great smell, my wife likes platinum and the velvetier&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;Fine aftershave is a top quality aftershave and I asked all my kids different scents for Christmas, I hope they deliver.</li>
            <li> The red&amp;blue sign rotates, welcomes me. The door opens, the bell rings. I&#x27;m in the men&#x27;s parlor, the anteroom of heaven : my shave den (at least how I like to imagine it hehe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great shave made in the purest tradition, great razor, great soap and... here comes the heaven part... best aftershave. When you splash your face with any of the Fine aftershave product you get to enter a particular world. Perfect balance of alcohol, not to strong, not too faint, perfect amount of fragrance leaves you with an amazing scent that will follow you throughout the day. In fact, the balance is so perfect that I wear American Blend as daily cologne, no need of another cologne. His spicy, leathery and manly scent gets me compliments everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there&#x27;s also this little splash of vitality that is insufflated in your numb body in the morning, and I call it THE MENTHOL FACTOR. I am not a huge menthol fan. In fact, I tend to dislike all strong menthol products because I find it covers the real scent. But Fine has successfully incorporated the right amount for the perfect freshness blast without the watery eyes effect. After a few minutes, menthol scent is gone but freshness is still there and fragrance blooms like a crazy horse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, passion, craftmanship and manliness, this is what Fine is all about.</li>
            <li> At first, I was mildly impressed. The American blend had a barbershop-like scent, cool menthol tingle that hid the roughness from a rushed shave and just enough of a burn to point where I had nicked myself. Everything I&#x27;d expect from something in the 40 to 50 dollar range. Great deal, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when things got interesting. Before I could put the towel back on the rack, my chest hair shot violently from their respective pours. I turned to see that my torso was brandished with hair in the shape of a bald eagle, crawing a song of freedom across my apartment bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: great scent, not too bad of a burn, really sooths after a shave, chest eagle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: girlfriend still is getting used to me constantly whistling \\&quot;You&#x27;re a Grand &#x27;Ol Flag\\&quot;. When I \\&quot;finish\\&quot; there are faint sounds of cannons and fireworks, which takes away any sense of subtlety. Also, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable in any clothes besides my plus-sized Captain America get-up or an Uncle Sam suit (currently settling for a blue business suit with red tie).</li>
            <li> Love the smell!  And so does the wife!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a fine shave unless you finish with a Fine aftershave.  Never disappoints in any flavor.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance. Just the right amount of menthol. You apply and the sensation just builds without being to overpowering. Love the barbershop fragrance. On the top of my list. If you don&#x27;t like menthol, this is not for you. I last used it after using Tiki shaving soap. Tiki lather is amazing! The combination of Tiki and Fine, left my face feeling smoother than at any other time.</li>
            <li> Good product. Not loud-just manly</li>
            <li> Scent OK bottle leaked during shipment.</li>
            <li> me either, but after splashing on little Italian Citrus I feel as I&#x27;ve been transported there, suddenly wearing a striped shirt while pushing a gondola and speaking something that sounds like lines from a Godfather film. Needless to say that the odor protruding from freshly clean shaving face seems to be meant for those who enjoy in the finer things in life. A sweet but manly scent with hints of citrus fruits. I&#x27;d swear this concoction is made from the ground bones of the most infamous of Cosa Nostra and world class pizza tossers alike. This splash radiates heat and will bring the sunshine and warmth to all of those with a nostril within a spaghetti strand from your person. Buyer beware...This splash may attract hordes of plate throwing, spoon wielding Italian beauties...use with caution.</li>
            <li> I first tried this aftershave when they came out with the XXX scent and I purchased the Italian Citrus as well. I love this stuff! The scent stays with me for a long time and because the ingredients are few  not worried about a ton of garbage that I don&#x27;t need. I will be getting the other scents VERY soon, heck the the price these are and for the quality and endurance you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get some today, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!! Heck get them all!</li>
            <li> A wonderful blend of essential oils, alcohol, menthol, and water without artificial colors.  The very pleasing scent lasts long enough without being overpowering.  This aftershave is a winner, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this aftershave.  It splashes on cool and refreshing.  The scent is subtle and masculine.  I wish it lasted longer, but it is, after all, aftershave, not cologne.  I warmly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the entire lineup of products, American Blend being my favorite. Excellent price and quality. Long lasting clean masculine scent. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a chump for &amp;#34;barbershop aftershaves&amp;#34;. I also bit because of the cool bottle. Pleasant fragrance that sadly died 2 minutes after applying it. I mean no remnants at all. There&#x27;s better ones out there for this price. I concede it did make my face feel great all day, thus it earns 3 stars. Just OK.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Fine Snake Bite aftershave because of the unusual name. The first time I used it I felt a menthol tingle and a menthol scent that smells like cough drops but it&#x27;s O.K.! It also had a sting to it but the sting isn&#x27;t too bad. I would rather use this than Osage Rub since that has too much menthol. The only complaint that I have about this aftershave is the fact that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> American: Smells like your pappy&#x27;s barbershop and definitely rocks an old-school American barber vibe. Feels great on the skin...I have found it goes on smelling pretty bold but fades within an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, with its good price point, it&#x27;s a winner! Just don&#x27;t be expecting to catch a whiff of it after your lunch hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Italian Citrus: Clean, fresh citrus scent that lasts for a good portion of the day. Great for hot spring or especially summer days. Another winner from Fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a unique scent, and boy did I find one. The women go crazy for Fresh Vetiver. The ladies at work kept passing by me, and sniffing me. I even had a stripper more interested in smelling my face than giving me a lap dance.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Barber Shop&amp;#34; smell you want, then this is it.</li>
            <li> After buying and using many aftershaves always looking at Fine Aftershaves I finally bought the Clean Vetiver and was blown away it is the best its long lasting yet not overpowering.Do yourself a favor if your shave was wonderful then complement it with a Fine Aftershave,try them all and see if you don&#x27;t smile like the guy on the logo,enjoy!</li>
            <li> Super clean and addictive fragrance! Old school bottle and simple ingredients make this the perfect accompaniment to any traditional wet shavers bathroom. You have to try this!</li>
