            <li> This basil oil is high quality in my humble opinion.  </li>
            <li> As usual, the Now brand lives up to its high standards.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of this mixed with my facial moisturizer or organic unrefined coconut oil for skin care.</li>
            <li> but has a slight anise flavor when added to foods such as stir fry.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s typical of essential oils.</li>
            <li> rejuvenating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am partial to the N.O.W. brand as their tops are user-friendly and don&#x27;t require pressing down while twisting to actually access the product.</li>
            <li> But this Now brand basil essential oil smelled way too heavily of Anise for my liking.  </li>
            <li> you can only use a few drops.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I reviewed this product and while I was pleased with the timeliness of delivery and quality of product, I was disappointed in the packaging as my product had leaked and a quarter of the bottle had been lost.</li>
            <li> In less than 24 hours, the shipper responded to my concerns and gave me a partial refund!</li>
            <li> The down side is the smell.  </li>
            <li> my daughter refused to come near me when she smelled the basil oil on my skin unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Use VERY little of that anise flavor will over power everything.</li>
            <li> I barely use it because of the awful smell.</li>
            <li> , been there, done that for a cold, so I avoid that at all costs, ladies on the um.. pill would know, I would think?</li>
            <li> Smells really bad.</li>

            <li> 100% Basil oil but has a slight anise flavor when added to foods such as stir fry. Use VERY little of that anise flavor will over power everything.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t like writing reviews so all i am going to say is ... I like it and you will too. That is all :-)</li>
            <li> High quality essential oil at a great price. Food grade. I add a few drops of this mixed with my facial moisturizer or organic unrefined coconut oil for skin care. Also a great scent on its own. Now Foods has the best oils.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice essential oil.  Good price and a reputable company to purchase essential oils from.  Is EXCELLENT to cook with.</li>

            <li> I love the NOW Foods essential Oils.  They are high quality.</li>

            <li> great oil. works for mucus.</li>
            <li> This is awesome along with tea tree oil and peppermint oil. I got a bite from a bug and it was in a crease on the side of my inner knee where you sit or do any type of workouts pretty much it was rubbing it. I just put a drop of this with tea tree oil and the mosquito? bite that was huge and red puffed around the bump started going down. I used it several times during the day time, and its almost all gone. I got basil just in time I believe! I thought it was going to be a infection and I&#x27;d have to go to the doctor and try not to be on antibiotics, been there, done that for a cold, so I avoid that at all costs, ladies on the um.. pill would know, I would think? Anyways I really didn&#x27;t have the money for a doctors appointment since no insurance, even with insurance, I&#x27;m sure this was the cheaper and all natural route to go. So this and tea tree plus peppermint oil to make the itchy go away helped big time!!!!</li>
            <li> good oil !!! thank you</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to keep flies away and it really works for keeping flies away from you. I would recommend for that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to add when making flax seed hair gel. It provides a wonderful sent and helps preserve the gel. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> High quality, very many uses. Helps  soothe you to sleep and works as an appetite suppressant. Good mixed with carrier oil to smooth cramps and other muscle aches. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. Smells great!</li>

            <li> very good and strong scent.</li>
            <li> Very powerful essential oil.  I use it on my hair when making my hair essential oils.  i do believe this product is just as powerful to use internally.  Now is also a herbal and essential oil company that is trusted to use in my personal herb Library.</li>
            <li> This basil oil is high quality in my humble opinion.  It goes great mixed with a couple drops of the grapefruit oil for a synergistic blend as suggested by Valerie Worwood in her Aromatherapy book.  I also added a couple drops to some Thai food I made, and the result was incredibly tasty.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like basil to me.</li>
            <li> As usual, the Now brand lives up to its high standards. I use Basil PEO directly on the tongue as a cure for diarrhea attacks. (You put 1-3 drops on the tongue &amp; chase with 1/2 glass of water. Can be repeated.) Now is a brand I trust.</li>
            <li> I love NOW products. I think they are right up there with Aura Cacia oils and Young Living/DoTerra.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality product. I used it for homemade cleaner.</li>

My customers love .. is what differentiates the packaging, mostly came very well packed .. Only once had a problem, and one of them came pouring perfumed the whole box, but nothing else, not stop buying ...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It really does work. Just bought our 3rd bottle thanks again!</li>
            <li> I used the basil oil to help heal some problems on my skin left over from fire ant bites that nothing else seemed to help.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of all NOW products.</li>
            <li> I put defusing sticks in this bottle and turn them daily!  A nice change of pace.  The smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved other brands of basil essential oil, and other varieties of Now brand essential oils.  But this Now brand basil essential oil smelled way too heavily of Anise for my liking.  I wish I&#x27;d had a sniff of this particular one before I&#x27;d ordered it.</li>
            <li> I love tinkering around with essential oils and coming up with new blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basil goes very well with grapefruit and Bergamot. It&#x27;s refreshing, relaxing, and rejuvenating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am partial to the N.O.W. brand as their tops are user-friendly and don&#x27;t require pressing down while twisting to actually access the product.</li>
            <li> thank you so much, and thanks for everything, i need, i want, i love it, its excellent, wonderful, forever thanks</li>
            <li> I massage a few drops into my face cream at night and wake up with my face looking a lil greasy but ACNE FREE and BLEMISH FREE. I love the smell the texture isnt too thick which works great i would recommend this to anyone who needs a herbal massage or better skin.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair remedies it help the growth.  I use it also in the bath to relieve stress.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on time. The basil oil is very pure.  you can only use a few drops. It does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Big fan of NOW products. Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like basil but that&#x27;s typical of essential oils.</li>
            <li> product arrived timely and intact</li>
            <li> Quality oil. Has a licorice smell tho.</li>
            <li> I order basil for pain in my knee.  It helps to relieve. The down side is the smell.  My family hates it, but I use it anyway!</li>
            <li> I love Now foods essential oils. They are always fresh and potent,  and the dropper insert is pretty reliable. I always come to this brand because of the price and quality.</li>
            <li> Tried basil oil to increase milk supply (1 of countless things i have tried) and it didnt work for us, bc my daughter refused to come near me when she smelled the basil oil on my skin unfortunately. But i am sure they work good for aroma therapy.</li>

            <li> I am making salve from this oil.  At first I didn&#x27;t know how to use it, since it cannot be ingested.  But I&#x27;m using it as an anti-inflammatory on arthritis before bed.  It has a relaxing aroma and does help with arthritis pain.</li>
