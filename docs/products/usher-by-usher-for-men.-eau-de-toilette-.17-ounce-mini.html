            <li> It smells good better then I thought I kept it I use myself</li>
            <li> Usher has created a good scent. I received quite a few compliments while wearing it, the only problem is that it can become overpowering if you&#x27;re not careful when applying</li>
            <li> Really small. I thought it was going to be average size, don&#x27;t be fooled. This cologne smells good but not worth it for the price you pay. Don&#x27;t be fooled or ripped off and buy the bigger one</li>
            <li> Way to small site pic when order was misleading</li>
            <li> The product DID Not come in a bottle like picture. It came in a small sample vial. Very disappointed. It was a gift..</li>
            <li> Was smaller than what I imagined but arrived early which was great</li>
            <li> Once you have it on it begins to smell better. At first didn&#x27;t like it. Got it for my husband.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells great and I do recommend that it be purchased if you are looking for that manly smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this before and the description clearly says how big, I mean small it is but dam! i had no idea it was this tiny? A waste of 8 bucks. They wasted so much paper and cardboard for this...</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend, so he could try it out. It was perfect size and smelled great too. It smells more like a Abercrombie and Fitch smell then an Old Spice so we really liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and delivered timely</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottle was.</li>
            <li> It has not been the first time that I ordered it for my husband and I will continue as he loves it (I do too!) and again he gets a lot of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;Very sexy fragrance and not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;will order again...and again...</li>
            <li> Good fragrance my husband enjoyed it..</li>
