    <ol>
            <li>so i could try getting my hair a perfect way</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for achieving any matte hair style.</li>
            <li>so I am happy.</li>
            <li>Adam Lavigne)I longer approach girls, they approach me lol.</li>
            <li>It has great hold too.</li>
            <li>Even though it wasn&#x27;t as good as I&#x27;d hope for, it is still a great product.</li>
            <li>biggest issue with this is the smell, while it smells good</li>
            <li>that was a gift for my friend&#x27;s friend and he loved it, I think.</li>
            <li>I heard a lot of good things about this product</li>
            <li>It smells good and washes out very easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to order more!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love quicksand!</li>
            <li>It also smells great and is extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This product does what it says and is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Nicely made wax.</li>
            <li>Quicksand is BY FAR the best hair product by Hanz De Fuko (which is probably why it&#x27;s always sold out)</li>
            <li>Totally easy to wash out, too!</li>
            <li>Works great, but given the price not sure its the best value</li>
            <li>It washes out easy and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The part I liked best is, your hair can be completely dry when styling.</li>
            <li>Hair did not stay up for more than five minutes.  </li>
            <li>and I love the texture/styling of my hair with this product.</li>
            <li>It works great, giving the hair soft to touch feel and manageable style!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, as expected from Hanz de Fuko.</li>
            <li>It is easy to style and restyle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the strongest hold, but it&#x27;s also extremely easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>Makes styling shorter hair easy</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s too strong.</li>
            <li>It has the strong hold and matte finish as indicated on the product itself.</li>
            <li>Hanz makes the best stuff hands down.</li>
            <li>It has a nice strong hold but a very matte finish</li>
            <li>It does have an incredible smell, but there is absolutely no hold</li>
            <li>- this is an organic hair product that really works well, and it&#x27;s also suppose to be sold exclusively on the manufacturer&#x27;s website, so it&#x27;s a nice find on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>The Sponge Wax works great on short hair and does give me a long-lasting matte hold throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Product is very matte and has a nice hold.</li>
            <li>Overall, It seems to be a great product</li>
            <li>I really like this product so far, but I probably need to use it a bit more in order to fairly judge it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if it would live up to the hype from those youtube videos showing how amazing it worked and looked on professionally-cut and styled hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells absolutely amazing and leaves the scent on my hands even after rinsing, which is a nice little bonus.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good, although, it might come off a somewhat feminine at first since it has a rather strong vanilla-ish smell to it, but I personally don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product.</li>
            <li>so I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>and I could tell that right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to wash off, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is great for styling, not much more I need to say on this topic.</li>
            <li>This product provides great hold without being too heavy, oily or \\&quot;crunchy,\\&quot; yet still pliable enough to successfully achieve a variety of different hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Well, needless to say I am very impressed after using it!</li>
            <li>I started using this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Thanks HDF!</li>
            <li>Awsome wax the only problem with is that its good for short hair up to 4 cm if you got a longer hair and want to style it as a quiff or something i recommend using sea salt spray or quicksand or a cream to increase the hold a lil bit and the hair color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and looks that way too in your hair with a nice matte finish that isn&#x27;t super stiff.</li>
            <li>Matte finish that doesn&#x27;t get hard and remains pliable all day and smells good.</li>
            <li>As I heard someone else say, It is very &amp;#34;noob friendly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Look into Quicksand for a far better product that will last much longer than this.</li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very pliable and you can change your hairstyle throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It really works to keep my hair how i want it to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to achieve different European hair styles(Cristano Ronaldo, William Levi, Enrique Iglesias,</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this wax.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products out there from American Crew to Redken, and so far this product is much better than those (at least for me)!</li>
            <li>This product (for me) did not at all live up to what I&#x27;ve read about it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to pay more than you would for products you can find in standard supermarkets, but that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li>The organic ingredients and natural extracts are a plus too!  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that I wish it came in a bigger size, but other than that I am really pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I wish the smell was more subtle.</li>
            <li>strong hold, matte finish but not completely matte, gives a little natural shine.</li>
            <li>I would recommend putting some in while the hair is wet, blow drying, then adding a little more.</li>
            <li>Consider you pay $18 for only 2oz (TWO ounces), while American Crew Fiber (another favorite of mine) is $15 for THREE ounces, and Gatsby is less than $10 for three ounces (but super hard to wash off).</li>
            <li>Usually hair products last me more than a year but with Hanz de Fuko, the only downside is that I&#x27;ll run out before the year ends since the jar is tiny.  </li>
            <li>Sponge Wax is decent for short hair, but the quantity and quality of this product is certainly not worth $18+.</li>
            <li>I would note that my particular order had a very dry and flaky consistency that I know is not normal for this product.</li>

            <li> As soon as I went outside in the heat, my hair went flat.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to try something new and branch off a bit from the typical products on store shelves...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for messy hairstyles and the pompadour look also works.</li>
            <li> My hair type is semi-medium length, straight, and somewhat thick.</li>
            <li> Does not live up to reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> I have thin Asian hair and for that classic 60&#x27;s look, it does the job.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the slightly feminine smell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no hold strength.</li>
            <li> I use this product after using quicksand and am partial to it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for spiking products, check out Gatsby Pink or Purple.</li>
            <li> The sponge wax is one of my favorites out of the other Hanz de Fuko products.</li>
            <li> The price was comparable to other products out there.  </li>
            <li> Even though it seems like it is a small jar, it actually goes a long way since you need very little to manage your hair.</li>
            <li> I also paid half the price compared to redkin sponge wax.</li>
            <li> Waste of $20</li>
            <li> I mix in conjunction with FX TEXTURE Dirt(for out of bed look) or Gatsby Grunge Matt wax(dry messy look).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I usually will envelope my hair with some KMS hairstay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a flawed product or what, but I might be purchasing mine from the official Hanz De Fuko website next</li>
            <li> Styles hair very easily, not too thick or thin.</li>
            <li> a little expensive though</li>
            <li> Not good for spiking at all.  </li>
            <li> I have flat ugly hair but this wax does miracles.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> a side note, this is an expensive product.</li>
            <li> but I decided to give it a try without it and after about 20 minutes of merely watching TV and walking around, it was already losing it&#x27;s shape and flattening.</li>
            <li> It stinks like rubber</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Matte finish that doesn&#x27;t get hard and remains pliable all day and smells good. Hanz makes the best stuff hands down.</li>
            <li> I cannot understand the appeal of this stuff.  It stinks like rubber and it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair. And on top of that, it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no hold strength. Hair did not stay up for more than five minutes.  Does not live up to reviews I&#x27;ve read. Waste of $20</li>
            <li> Works great, but given the price not sure its the best value</li>
            <li> This product is great for styling, not much more I need to say on this topic. It&#x27;s also very easy to wash off, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with this is the smell, while it smells good but I think it&#x27;s too strong. It smells like a concentrated baby powder. I wish the smell was more subtle. This is the only thing preventing me from giving it a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, this is an expensive product. Consider you pay $18 for only 2oz (TWO ounces), while American Crew Fiber (another favorite of mine) is $15 for THREE ounces, and Gatsby is less than $10 for three ounces (but super hard to wash off). I will be rotating this with my AC Fiber. And I did not factor the price into my rating.</li>
            <li> that was a gift for my friend&#x27;s friend and he loved it, I think. he get what he wanted, so</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good things about this product so I decided to get it. I admit that I had unreal expectations in ordering this product. Even though it wasn&#x27;t as good as I&#x27;d hope for, it is still a great product. It has a nice strong hold but a very matte finish, you can&#x27;t even tell there&#x27;s anything in your hair. As I heard someone else say, It is very &amp;#34;noob friendly&amp;#34;. It is easy to style and restyle. The part I liked best is, your hair can be completely dry when styling.</li>
            <li> Awsome wax the only problem with is that its good for short hair up to 4 cm if you got a longer hair and want to style it as a quiff or something i recommend using sea salt spray or quicksand or a cream to increase the hold a lil bit and the hair color</li>
            <li> I wanted a dryer wax so I thought I would give this product a try. It is a different texture than wax...almost like a paste....but it does not leave globs of product in hair or flake out...so I am happy.</li>
            <li> The sponge wax is one of my favorites out of the other Hanz de Fuko products. It works great, giving the hair soft to touch feel and manageable style! Totally easy to wash out, too! I have a messy hairstyle, so when I apply this product it really helps contribute to the look that I strive for. The only problem is that I wish it came in a bigger size, but other than that I am really pleased with the product. I highly recommend this for messy hairstyles and the pompadour look also works.</li>
            <li> really wishing i wouldn&#x27;t have wasted all that money on it. I bought this so i could try getting my hair a perfect way but i couldnt. so i just stopped using it and so it sits.</li>
            <li> This product (for me) did not at all live up to what I&#x27;ve read about it. It does have an incredible smell, but there is absolutely no hold and I could tell that right away. I usually will envelope my hair with some KMS hairstay but I decided to give it a try without it and after about 20 minutes of merely watching TV and walking around, it was already losing it&#x27;s shape and flattening. Quicksand is BY FAR the best hair product by Hanz De Fuko (which is probably why it&#x27;s always sold out) and I definitely recommend it to everyone for any hair style. Sponge Wax is decent for short hair, but the quantity and quality of this product is certainly not worth $18+. Look into Quicksand for a far better product that will last much longer than this. Hope I could be of assistance, Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, as expected from Hanz de Fuko. It smells absolutely amazing and leaves the scent on my hands even after rinsing, which is a nice little bonus. It&#x27;s all natural and looks that way too in your hair with a nice matte finish that isn&#x27;t super stiff. I would note that my particular order had a very dry and flaky consistency that I know is not normal for this product. I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a flawed product or what, but I might be purchasing mine from the official Hanz De Fuko website next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the strongest hold, but it&#x27;s also extremely easy to wash out. I would recommend putting some in while the hair is wet, blow drying, then adding a little more. If you need a stronger hold just add some hairspray at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the value, it&#x27;s a pretty small amount but you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot so I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth it. You&#x27;re going to pay more than you would for products you can find in standard supermarkets, but that&#x27;s to be expected - this is an organic hair product that really works well, and it&#x27;s also suppose to be sold exclusively on the manufacturer&#x27;s website, so it&#x27;s a nice find on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I had initial reservations about this product.  I didn&#x27;t know if it would live up to the hype from those youtube videos showing how amazing it worked and looked on professionally-cut and styled hair.  Well, needless to say I am very impressed after using it! Keep in mind I&#x27;ve been using drugstore hair products all my life ranging from Paul Mitchell/Redken/American Crew.  The Sponge Wax works great on short hair and does give me a long-lasting matte hold throughout the day.  I have thin Asian hair and for that classic 60&#x27;s look, it does the job.  Usually hair products last me more than a year but with Hanz de Fuko, the only downside is that I&#x27;ll run out before the year ends since the jar is tiny.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to order more!</li>
            <li> I love this! Makes styling shorter hair easy and I love the texture/styling of my hair with this product. Even though it seems like it is a small jar, it actually goes a long way since you need very little to manage your hair. Seems to last a while as well.</li>
            <li> After a recommendation from my stylist, I bought Hanz de Fuko Sponge Wax for my husband, but now we both use it!  This product provides great hold without being too heavy, oily or \\&quot;crunchy,\\&quot; yet still pliable enough to successfully achieve a variety of different hairstyles. It also smells great and is extremely easy to use.  The organic ingredients and natural extracts are a plus too!  I&#x27;m definitely sold on Sponge Wax and look forward to trying out the rest of the Hanz de Fuko product line.</li>
            <li> I did not received the same product as advertised. The container did not have the same label and the wax did not smell and work the same.</li>
            <li> I have flat ugly hair but this wax does miracles. I&#x27;m able to achieve different European hair styles(Cristano Ronaldo, William Levi, Enrique Iglesias, Adam Lavigne)I longer approach girls, they approach me lol. strong hold, matte finish but not completely matte, gives a little natural shine. I mix in conjunction with FX TEXTURE Dirt(for out of bed look) or Gatsby Grunge Matt wax(dry messy look).</li>
            <li> Nicely made wax. Styles hair very easily, not too thick or thin. Product is very matte and has a nice hold. The only downside is the slightly feminine smell. (Almost like vanilla?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I started using this product for the first time today. My hair type is semi-medium length, straight, and somewhat thick. This product does what it says and is simply amazing. It has the strong hold and matte finish as indicated on the product itself. I really like this product so far, but I probably need to use it a bit more in order to fairly judge it. I have tried many products out there from American Crew to Redken, and so far this product is much better than those (at least for me)! The smell is pretty good, although, it might come off a somewhat feminine at first since it has a rather strong vanilla-ish smell to it, but I personally don&#x27;t mind it. I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to try something new and branch off a bit from the typical products on store shelves...Overall, It seems to be a great product and I will continue to use it! Thanks HDF!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product. It&#x27;s perfect for achieving any matte hair style. It washes out easy and it smells amazing. It has great hold too. I have very thick hair but this product holds it up all day. It&#x27;s also very pliable and you can change your hairstyle throughout the day. I would highly recommend this wax.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love quicksand! I use this product after using quicksand and am partial to it. I do have thicker hair so molding my hair to the way I&#x27;d like it can be a challenge. I also paid half the price compared to redkin sponge wax. Definitely a plus! I&#x27;d like to try the hybridized wax and hopefully it&#x27;s easier to sculpt with</li>
            <li> It really works to keep my hair how i want it to be. Without it my hair just gets frizzy and falls down.&lt;br /&gt;Its a little expensive though so I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Read a lot of rave reviews about this product, so I decided to give it a try.  The price was comparable to other products out there.  I found it to have a consistency similar to Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Sumotech.  It smells good and washes out very easily.  However, it doesn&#x27;t hold well at all.  As soon as I went outside in the heat, my hair went flat.  Not good for spiking at all.  I will not be ordering again.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  If you are looking for spiking products, check out Gatsby Pink or Purple.</li>
