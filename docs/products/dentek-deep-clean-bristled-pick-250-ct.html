            <li>These are great to use after you eat using either the toothpick side or the bristle side.  </li>
            <li>great for the gums and easier than floss.  </li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love these picks!  </li>
            <li>Not that effective.</li>
            <li>These things are the absolute best for those with braces.</li>
            <li>Mom&#x27;s dentist recommended these for her as floss wasn&#x27;t effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These cheap copies of the good product hurt and irritate my gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using bristle picks for over a year now, and am very pleased with the way I can clean in between my teeth after eating.  </li>
            <li>My gums look so much better</li>
            <li>i love these dental picks.  </li>
            <li>These are okay, except that if you use it too aggressively, the brush tip breaks off.  </li>
            <li>what works, my Interdentals Brush Cleaner, plus each comes with a plastic cover so you can use it more than once.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Better than wood toothpicks.</li>
            <li>The price was  better than others I priced.</li>
            <li>I have been  using this GREAT procuts for the last  5 yrs !!!</li>
            <li>Does a great job when used properly.</li>
            <li>They are very useful.  </li>
            <li>I have used several different kinds of these picks and these do a great job at cleaning the teeth and feel good on the gums.</li>
            <li>and these clean my teeth and have a minty taste</li>
            <li>They feel really good between the teeth, especially the bristled side</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean after brushing and using these.</li>
            <li>I guess for the money they are worth it.</li>
            <li>so I feel like I have fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was buying something totally different, but all in all, these are okay.  </li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t worth as a replacement for dental floss.</li>
            <li>i will most definitely be ordering them again.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>I will still be trying to find the original dual action cleaners, these Deep Clean Dental Picks are really junk.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for to floss my teeth.</li>
            <li>thanks  to DENTEK ,</li>
            <li>These work very well.  </li>
            <li>Right what I need - not too soft, although they do bend, but this is why you don&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li>Obviously, other people love them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but something about the DenTek version just works better.</li>
            <li>So I tried these and they are not what I was looking for, overall not bad</li>
            <li>I could not find throw away travel tooth brushes at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>they are now almost impossible to find in the stores, so i am thrilled to have been able to find them here on amazon.  </li>
            <li>These had plastic bristles jutting out from two sides, unlike the Dual Action Cleaners which had actual bristle and the bristles surrounded the whole tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very convenient, low price, 250 in a pack.  </li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t and used to receive all these negative comments from my dentist that I need to do a better job flossing.</li>
            <li>When I come back from lunch and am sitting at my desk, I grab one and start cleaning as I am reading my new emails!  </li>
            <li>The pick itself is thicker (hard to clean in between teeth!)</li>
            <li>These are okay but not really as good as I was thinking they would be.</li>
            <li>Deep Clean Dental Picks were the same little brushes in a newly designed package.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I thought I was buying something totally different, but all in all, these are okay.  They are white tooth-pick sized toothpics, except one of then ends is a tiny plastic brush that is flexible.</li>
            <li> I thought this would have bristles but it feels like its just surated grooves in the thin plastic. Not that effective.</li>
            <li> Love these picks!  When I come back from lunch and am sitting at my desk, I grab one and start cleaning as I am reading my new emails!  They feel really good between the teeth, especially the bristled side and you can just feel the cleaning you are getting at the gum line.  They keep the placque from building up between teeth.  Very convenient, low price, 250 in a pack.  Will definitely buy another pack when needed!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for to floss my teeth. It&#x27;s just a pick, no string to slide between your teeth. Really doesn&#x27;t worth as a replacement for dental floss.</li>
            <li> I love dentek but not not these!  In the past, I&#x27;ve always purchased these at Target.  This time, I purchased through Amazon.  Here&#x27;s the difference.  The packaging was different than shown.  The pick itself is thicker (hard to clean in between teeth!), the fish bones are smaller, less flexible, and flatten after one pass between teeth.  See the attached photo.  Target package and pick on the left and  I do not recommend these!</li>
            <li> I have used several different kinds of these picks and these do a great job at cleaning the teeth and feel good on the gums.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss!  So I don&#x27;t and used to receive all these negative comments from my dentist that I need to do a better job flossing. I came across Dentek Deep Cleaning Tooth Picks and now I receive glowing dental exams. My gums look so much better and I have little or no tarter on my teeth since I started using Dentek Deep Cleaning Tooth Picks.  I Will never stop using Dentek Deep Cleaning Tooth Pick!!</li>
            <li> If I could give these zero stars I would.  For a couple of years I was using Dentek Dual Action Cleaners which had a plastic toothpick on one side and a very thin brush on the other.  They were great and very comfortable to use.  I looked for them on Amazon because the Dentek site was no longer taking orders online, the site just recommended stores selling their products.  I thought these Dentek Deep Clean Dental Picks were the same little brushes in a newly designed package.&lt;br /&gt;It turned out they were not the same product.  These had plastic bristles jutting out from two sides, unlike the Dual Action Cleaners which had actual bristle and the bristles surrounded the whole tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cheap copies of the good product hurt and irritate my gums.  Obviously, other people love them.  I totally disagree.  I will still be trying to find the original dual action cleaners, these Deep Clean Dental Picks are really junk.</li>
            <li> what I wanted and couldn&#x27;t find in local stores</li>
            <li> Will never be without them again.</li>
            <li> These things are the absolute best for those with braces. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but something about the DenTek version just works better. My order came in a neat little plastic dispenser rather than the baggie shown in the listing.</li>
            <li> i love these dental picks.  they are now almost impossible to find in the stores, so i am thrilled to have been able to find them here on amazon.  i will most definitely be ordering them again.  i know that my dentist appreciates that i use these every day.</li>
            <li> The bristled ends are too rough on gums. I&#x27;m concerned about the bristles breaking off in my mouth and being swallowed. Given that the bottom of the bag they came in is salted with little white specks makes me wonder how much of this questionable plastic is being absorbed or swallowed with every use. While I bought these in the store and not through Amazon doesn&#x27;t change the safety factor.</li>
            <li> These are okay but not really as good as I was thinking they would be. I guess for the money they are worth it.</li>
            <li> Addictive! I look forward to cleaning my teeth after a meal now that I have these excellent picks.</li>
            <li> These are okay, except that if you use it too aggressively, the brush tip breaks off.  I have spacing between my teeth, ordinarily buy the Interdental Cleaner Brush, and was looking to save a dollar or two.  I will not be buying the bristled pick again.  I&#x27;m sticking to what works, my Interdentals Brush Cleaner, plus each comes with a plastic cover so you can use it more than once.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hAVE  Cavities thanks  to DENTEK ,...... I have been  using this GREAT procuts for the last  5 yrs !!!</li>
            <li> Great picks and good taste.</li>
            <li> Purchased before and will again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted. Now we don&#x27;t have to go hunting for these at the store! Mom&#x27;s dentist recommended these for her as floss wasn&#x27;t effective. These helped save her teeth and gums and get rid of her gingivitis.</li>
            <li> Good stuff at good price. Right what I need - not too soft, although they do bend, but this is why you don&#x27;t hurt your gums. One end is just sharp, while the other one is a tiny brush to scrub your in-between teeth.</li>
            <li> I love these. My teeth feel super clean after brushing and using these.</li>
            <li> I could not find throw away travel tooth brushes at a decent price.  These work very well.  I eat out a lot and then go shopping and these clean my teeth and have a minty taste so I feel like I have fresh breath.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.  They are flimsy and I usually use two that is why I did not give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> They worked just great.</li>
            <li> Great product. Better than wood toothpicks. Use carefully or you could damage your gums. Does a great job when used properly.</li>
            <li> this would eliminate your visit to dental hygenists, and save bundle, every year, at almost no costs, simply using it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything but the little flossers in the store so I came to Amazon and as usual they had them!  These are great to use after you eat using either the toothpick side or the bristle side.  I like to use the bristle side inbetween my teeth before I floss.  They get any larger pieces of food stuck in there so flossing is less messy.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using bristle picks for over a year now, and am very pleased with the way I can clean in between my teeth after eating.  They&#x27;re the perfect way to remove food particles that get stuck...and the bristles help to stimulate the gums.</li>
            <li> These picks work extremely well.  They are very useful.  The price was  better than others I priced.</li>
            <li> great for the gums and easier than floss.  My dentist is pleased with the result as am I.  Great Product</li>
            <li> Love these picks!  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a couple of pick brushes after a cleaning, I went to the DenTek site but couldn&#x27;t find them. So I tried these and they are not what I was looking for, overall not bad</li>
