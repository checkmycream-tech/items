            <li>The top of this slide has a mirror in it</li>
            <li>I love the size of it with 44 pieces.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying 4 more to give as gifts to my friends.</li>
            <li>She seemed to like the case more than the make-up in it....</li>
            <li>:)  </li>

            <li>the quality is great as always and the design is lovely would really recommend it</li>

            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>quality is top notch.</li>
            <li>so we had supplemented so lipgloss in more muted toned.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know many that would wear those lipstick shades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually the perfect size for on the go!</li>
            <li>It has many layers that you can vary depending on your makeup needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for fixing or touching up your makeup after a long day.</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself at first to try it out- love it!</li>
            <li>Its perfect for a young person interested in makeup or when you have to pack ultra light.</li>
            <li>Awe this is so sweet!</li>
            <li>Great cheap makeup that I bought for my 7 year old to play with.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old loved it, I just said I liked it because she loved it too much and wants to wear makeup everywhere now.  </li>
            <li>This would have been fine.</li>
            <li>I love the colors they are very universal and are trendy too!</li>
            <li>I really like how portable and cute this is!</li>
            <li>its quality is as cheap as the price.</li>
            <li>The face powders may be too light for some though.</li>
            <li>I liked this set so much I&#x27;ve put them in my beauty bag inside my purse.</li>
            <li>especially if you&#x27;re on the go a lot and something this compact to take is great.</li>
            <li>and she not only looked great but was beaming in excitement over the gift.  </li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>The mirror fell out and the make up is cheap.</li>
            <li>everything in a single easy to carry go anywhere case easy to use great design</li>
            <li>I love the packaging so much!</li>
            <li>I was excited to see this product.</li>
            <li>The Shany Deluxe Makeup Set has a good collection of colors for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>The kit looks cool as hell, but it&#x27;s makeup for kids.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stink and has enough colors and variety that she and her friends have loved it.</li>
            <li>Container , while cool concept, is flimsy and slides every where making it not sturdy for application purposes.</li>
            <li>(the pressed powder ) and that wasn&#x27;t good for a Christmas present</li>
            <li>The lip glosses are cool too.</li>
            <li>The applicator tips broke off and I hadn&#x27;t used them in a full week.</li>
            <li>Nice to have everything in a nice little package.</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;ve tried them all on and none are so bold that they come off as lipstick.</li>
            <li>The quality and choices given in this set are extraordinary.</li>
            <li>Cool design with lots of fun color choices.</li>
            <li>but its long enough wear is great because no one wears makeup for more than 10 hours.</li>
            <li>All the shadows are really smooth and blend really well.</li>
            <li>There is no way I could travel with this in a bag or purse as another review said because the lid will not stay shut nor has any kind of clasp and flies open.</li>
            <li>If she hints on more stuff from here I have absolutely no qualms with purchasing more.</li>
            <li>and I had fun giving it to her.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;s just being nice or actually does.</li>
            <li>This purchase was worth the money.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s having fun with it, no complaints.  </li>
            <li>but really useful</li>
            <li>What a fun set.  </li>
            <li>we gave her a makeover right away</li>
            <li>What a great little set!</li>
            <li>It is not long lasting but it is great for on the go.</li>
            <li>Each time they put on a play, they have to tote large makeup bags full of stuff to the program to use to get ready.</li>
            <li>First the package was not sealed and the top flung open immediatly upon taking it out of the box</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish for is a more neutral lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>this is her first experience with makeup.</li>
            <li>A family friend&#x27;s daughter is getting interested in makeup and her mother doesn&#x27;t know a lot about makeup</li>
            <li>I can not stress enough that I love Shany&#x27;s color payoff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to keep one for myself because I like it so much!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my sister, and gave it to her before her sons wedding, she loved it and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about this because I am gifting it to my sister ;-)</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors!</li>
            <li>all in all, great little kit to use for travel or daily usage.</li>
            <li>Very neutral browns, pinks, golds and smoky colors.</li>
            <li>&gt; the whole day.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>very well thought out</li>
            <li>took away a star as the lipsticks seemed very bright/bold</li>
            <li>it is very useful and the foundations are well above expectations.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this to anyone, quality is very important for cosmetic goods, not only it is not healthy for face and skin but also in this quality it does not help you to look better</li>
            <li>but other then that  it came fast and most part in one peace.</li>
            <li>I was very much surprised at the quality ofvthe product when you consider the very reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li>Simple gift for a relative who loves cosmetics with out emptying the pocket. :-)</li>
            <li>If making a test between this and high end product you wouldn&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The top piece of this set holds 8 eye-shadows along with a few brushes.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have other brushes I can use.</li>
            <li>This kit is so small and cute.</li>
            <li>This set pretty much has everything they use other than eyeliner.</li>
            <li>So instead of taking a large bag of mixed makeup, she can take just this one set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide one, the top:&lt;br</li>
            <li>This looks like a cute little kit for a tween or teenager just starting out.</li>
            <li>May just give it to my 5 yr old niece to play dress up with...........</li>
            <li>None one of the sections of makeup were completely in tact as if you would have bought from a store.  </li>
            <li>I bought this kit for my 12 year old niece who was wanting to begin experimenting with make-up.  </li>
            <li>I could pass it on to my 15 year old neice...</li>
            <li>Very cool design as she loses everything</li>
            <li>We decided to live with it as is instead of sending it back.  </li>
            <li>and it was a total mess to clean up all the powder.</li>
            <li>I only got it for her to practice, experiment around the house, but alas I got more than I bargained for.</li>
            <li>There is also a large assortment of blue and green shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide 3:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li> However I&#x27;ve tried them all on and none are so bold that they come off as lipstick.</li>
            <li> The quality and choices given in this set are extraordinary.</li>
            <li> Cool design with lots of fun color choices.</li>
            <li> but its long enough wear is great because no one wears makeup for more than 10 hours.</li>
            <li> All the shadows are really smooth and blend really well.</li>
            <li> There is no way I could travel with this in a bag or purse as another review said because the lid will not stay shut nor has any kind of clasp and flies open.</li>
            <li> If she hints on more stuff from here I have absolutely no qualms with purchasing more.</li>
            <li> and I had fun giving it to her.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;s just being nice or actually does.</li>
            <li> This purchase was worth the money.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s having fun with it, no complaints.  </li>
            <li> but really useful</li>
            <li> What a fun set.  </li>
            <li> we gave her a makeover right away</li>
            <li> What a great little set!</li>
            <li> It is not long lasting but it is great for on the go.</li>
            <li> Each time they put on a play, they have to tote large makeup bags full of stuff to the program to use to get ready.</li>
            <li> First the package was not sealed and the top flung open immediatly upon taking it out of the box</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish for is a more neutral lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> this is her first experience with makeup.</li>
            <li> A family friend&#x27;s daughter is getting interested in makeup and her mother doesn&#x27;t know a lot about makeup</li>
            <li> I can not stress enough that I love Shany&#x27;s color payoff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to keep one for myself because I like it so much!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister, and gave it to her before her sons wedding, she loved it and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this because I am gifting it to my sister ;-)</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors!</li>
            <li> all in all, great little kit to use for travel or daily usage.</li>
            <li> Very neutral browns, pinks, golds and smoky colors.</li>
            <li> &gt; the whole day.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> very well thought out</li>
            <li> took away a star as the lipsticks seemed very bright/bold</li>
            <li> it is very useful and the foundations are well above expectations.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this to anyone, quality is very important for cosmetic goods, not only it is not healthy for face and skin but also in this quality it does not help you to look better</li>
            <li> but other then that  it came fast and most part in one peace.</li>
            <li> I was very much surprised at the quality ofvthe product when you consider the very reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li> Simple gift for a relative who loves cosmetics with out emptying the pocket. :-)</li>
            <li> If making a test between this and high end product you wouldn&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The top piece of this set holds 8 eye-shadows along with a few brushes.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have other brushes I can use.</li>
            <li> This kit is so small and cute.</li>
            <li> This set pretty much has everything they use other than eyeliner.</li>
            <li> So instead of taking a large bag of mixed makeup, she can take just this one set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide one, the top:&lt;br</li>
            <li> This looks like a cute little kit for a tween or teenager just starting out.</li>
            <li> May just give it to my 5 yr old niece to play dress up with...........</li>
            <li> None one of the sections of makeup were completely in tact as if you would have bought from a store.  </li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my 12 year old niece who was wanting to begin experimenting with make-up.  </li>
            <li> I could pass it on to my 15 year old neice...</li>
            <li> Very cool design as she loses everything</li>
            <li> We decided to live with it as is instead of sending it back.  </li>
            <li> and it was a total mess to clean up all the powder.</li>
            <li> I only got it for her to practice, experiment around the house, but alas I got more than I bargained for.</li>
            <li> There is also a large assortment of blue and green shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide 3:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Very neat little compact kit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe the colors as cherry red, deep red and a lighter slightly pinkish red.</li>
            <li> I think that the actual makeup is \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The colors are shads of green, charcoal, blue, lavender, pink, orange yellow and a cream color.</li>
            <li> The quality of the makeup is so-so; the eye shadow, powder, and blush all crumbled and create a big mess when the kit is being used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe them as pink, very pink, mauve, peach and brownish-rose color.</li>
            <li> The other four colors range from lighter shades to a light-to-medium tan color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide 5</li>
            <li> I saw SHANY had other items</li>
            <li> They were also stiff and not soft.</li>
            <li> The dark gloss colors give lips just a shine of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to be holding it in such a way that they come apart when you don&#x27;t mean for them to</li>
            <li> I got it for my little girl and niece to play with while I put mine on.</li>
            <li> (the lid/mirror was broken off of the rest of the kit-obviously occurred prior to shipping, not during.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few for my cousins and I have a couple extras to give away as gifts.</li>
            <li> This product is designed in an round shape and it all fits together just so.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> only complaint i had was that some of the blush pods was broken.</li>
            <li> ONLY one lip gloss no  lipsticks, considering the variety of shades and blushes the product is expensive.</li>
            <li> This set has a ton of makeup in a small package.</li>
            <li> I told her to start her out with something small and not too fancy.</li>
            <li> In fact on each and every single row there was at least 1 section of makeup that was cracked and broken apart.  </li>
            <li> The colors are dull and don&#x27;t stay on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> and they drop and hit a hard tile bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> (I mean this does not a good job in make up) .</li>
            <li> This is not good quality make up.</li>
            <li> I recieved this today in the mail and was not happy at all.</li>
            <li> sorry so late in posting...</li>
            <li> Product seems acceptable except that all the face powder was broken up and all over the place when we opened the box.</li>
            <li> it was all broken and coming out of the box.</li>
            <li> broken  </li>
            <li> and durable I&#x27;ve dropped it like 3 times since I&#x27;ve bought it and the shadow have broken yet.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only that but the packaging was terrible everything i got was broke.</li>
            <li> That said, we were disappointed that it arrived broken</li>
            <li> but it was a disappointment because this was a gift</li>
            <li> The blush brush feels awkward with the bristles on my skin.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with the color of their products.</li>
            <li> I promise, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> , they make that almost impossible!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> was a gift &amp; she Loved it!</li>
            <li> This makeup kit was TINY!  I bought it thinking it would be great for my niece who will be a teenager soon.  I couldn&#x27;t even give it to her because it looked so cheap!  I think that the actual makeup is \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The kit looks cool as hell, but it&#x27;s makeup for kids. The colors are dull and don&#x27;t stay on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very low quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this one  as a gift to my niece. the design is adorable, size is compact. ONLY one lip gloss no  lipsticks, considering the variety of shades and blushes the product is expensive. Guess the product it priced for the design not of content. Packing by Amazon was good so arrived in one peice. but if one is lookig for a better price and more variety of contents than the design this is not for them.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. Very nice kit and she loves how it all fans out.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:c24b92e4fc25e4e162d5d57616762dcb]] This set has a ton of makeup in a small package. The size and shape makes it handy for travel and gift giving. It&#x27;s also the perfect size for my daughter to take along to use for her school&#x27;s children&#x27;s theater programs. Each time they put on a play, they have to tote large makeup bags full of stuff to the program to use to get ready. This set pretty much has everything they use other than eyeliner. So instead of taking a large bag of mixed makeup, she can take just this one set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide one, the top:&lt;br /&gt;The top piece of this set holds 8 eye-shadows along with a few brushes. The colors are shads of green, charcoal, blue, lavender, pink, orange yellow and a cream color. The lavendar color is sort of a smoky purple. The top of this slide has a mirror in it so you can see yourself to put on the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide 2:&lt;br /&gt;More eye-shadow. Tons of neutral tones. Very neutral browns, pinks, golds and smoky colors. There is also a large assortment of blue and green shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide 3:&lt;br /&gt;This section has 5 blush colors. I&#x27;d describe them as pink, very pink, mauve, peach and brownish-rose color. This section comes with a blush brush as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide 4:&lt;br /&gt;This section has pressed powders. Five of them. The lightest is an ivory like shade with yellow undertones. The other four colors range from lighter shades to a light-to-medium tan color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide 5, the bottom:&lt;br /&gt;The bottom of this case holds additional brushes and also 3 glosses. I&#x27;d describe the colors as cherry red, deep red and a lighter slightly pinkish red. However I&#x27;ve tried them all on and none are so bold that they come off as lipstick. The dark gloss colors give lips just a shine of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the slides can come apart. So should you need to take one out while putting makeup on, you can. However keep that in mind also while using it. You don&#x27;t want to be holding it in such a way that they come apart when you don&#x27;t mean for them to and they drop and hit a hard tile bathroom floor. It&#x27;s a cute set that if perfect for my daughter to use as her heater makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.e bathroom floor. It&#x27;s a cute set that if perfect for my daughter to use as her heater makeup.    Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter to use for \\&quot;makeovers\\&quot; when her friends come over, not for my own use.  That said, we were disappointed that it arrived broken (the lid/mirror was broken off of the rest of the kit-obviously occurred prior to shipping, not during.  We decided to live with it as is instead of sending it back.  The quality of the makeup is so-so; the eye shadow, powder, and blush all crumbled and create a big mess when the kit is being used.  I would not purchase again-not even for kids.</li>
            <li> I recieved this today in the mail and was not happy at all. First the package was not sealed and the top flung open immediatly upon taking it out of the box, there was also make up all over the outside of the case. There is no way I could travel with this in a bag or purse as another review said because the lid will not stay shut nor has any kind of clasp and flies open. I am not impressed with this at all. May just give it to my 5 yr old niece to play dress up with........... I will NOT buy this product again!</li>
            <li> it very nice i would buy it again. only complaint i had was that some of the blush pods was broken. but other then that  it came fast and most part in one peace.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister, and gave it to her before her sons wedding, she loved it and use it everyday.  Nice to have everything in a nice little package.</li>
            <li> This are  a very good  highly pigmented eye shadows, Nice set of blush , powder and lip gloss set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If making a test between this and high end product you wouldn&#x27;t know the difference. Over all it lasted me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; the whole day. Great eyeshadow colors, All you need in one kit It&#x27;s just Amazing cute  kit, really good value will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0034KYDTM B0034KYDTM]]</li>
            <li> got this for grand daughter for Christmas , she loved this....in all-in-one, great for touch up anywhere....done, done, done, done........</li>
            <li> received as christmas gift.  sorry so late in posting...she loved it. thanks</li>
            <li> This kit is so small and cute.It has everything in it.I love the size of it with 44 pieces.It&#x27;s the perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a great makeup gift?! I bought this for myself at first to try it out- love it! The quality and choices given in this set are extraordinary. I ended up buying 4 more to give as gifts to my friends. If you think you might like it, try it! I promise, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything it said it was which was everything my wife was looking for. If she hints on more stuff from here I have absolutely no qualms with purchasing more.</li>
            <li> she loved it!! everything in a single easy to carry go anywhere case easy to use great design very well thought out</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:ade75ed4ec8bd8490e9ef3d910a0468a]] The Shany Deluxe Makeup Set has a good collection of colors for everyday use.  The only thing I wish for is a more neutral lip gloss.  This video gives a brief tour of the collection.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> When the makeup kit was opened there was makeup dust everywhere.  None one of the sections of makeup were completely in tact as if you would have bought from a store.  In fact on each and every single row there was at least 1 section of makeup that was cracked and broken apart.  Just imagining opening up this on Christmas morning to have makeup fall all over the floor.  This is currently in the process of being returned.</li>
            <li> Product seems acceptable except that all the face powder was broken up and all over the place when we opened the box. My daughter does not use face powder so I did not go through the hassle of returning the product but it was a disappointment because this was a gift and it was a total mess to clean up all the powder.</li>
            <li> Great cheap makeup that I bought for my 7 year old to play with. It doesn&#x27;t stink and has enough colors and variety that she and her friends have loved it.</li>
            <li> it was all broken and coming out of the box.</li>
            <li> I opened the brushes and they broke. They were also stiff and not soft. Fortunately, I have other brushes I can use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this by my granddaughter said when opened, it kinda looks like a flower.  She really LOVED this gift and I had fun giving it to her.</li>
            <li> Looks nice on picture, but once you get it it had very cheap look.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but the packaging was terrible everything i got was broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, I don&#x27;t know anything about make-up, I bought this for my daughter who lost a lot of her make-up in a lost baggage claim.  She seemed to like the case more than the make-up in it....lol.  Either way she says she loves it and uses it, but I don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;s just being nice or actually does.</li>
            <li> This kit was perfect for my niece this is her first experience with makeup. The quality of the makeup is good. The compact size is great for a girl on the go.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging so much! It&#x27;s adorable and perfect for a young girl just learning makeup. It has everything you need to start out and take with you on the go. Love it!</li>
            <li> A family friend&#x27;s daughter is getting interested in makeup and her mother doesn&#x27;t know a lot about makeup so she was asking me about stuff. I told her to start her out with something small and not too fancy. I didn&#x27;t want to overwhelm either of them. I think I&#x27;m going to tell her about this. Its perfect for a young person interested in makeup or when you have to pack ultra light.</li>
            <li> its quality is as cheap as the price. I do not recommend this to anyone, quality is very important for cosmetic goods, not only it is not healthy for face and skin but also in this quality it does not help you to look better (I mean this does not a good job in make up) .</li>
            <li> Awe this is so sweet! Make up kits like these are so great to give and I just love the shape of this one, it looks like a tear drop!</li>
            <li> I would give this as a Christmas gift. The design is great! The face powders may be too light for some though. Very neat little compact kit!</li>
            <li> This purchase was worth the money. Simple gift for a relative who loves cosmetics with out emptying the pocket. :-)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  She loves it.  Cool design with lots of fun color choices. Love!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my 12 year old niece who was wanting to begin experimenting with make-up.  She was THRILLED with the kit and is having a wonderful time exploring the colors and fun of make-up application.  :)  It&#x27;s a great buy for the quality and quantity you receive!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this because I am gifting it to my sister ;-) have to wait and see she likes it or not :-)</li>
            <li> My 14 year old loved it, I just said I liked it because she loved it too much and wants to wear makeup everywhere now.  I only got it for her to practice, experiment around the house, but alas I got more than I bargained for. She&#x27;s having fun with it, no complaints.  Very cool design as she loses everything, they make that almost impossible!!</li>
            <li> This was nice my niece liked it, lots of variety</li>
            <li> I was excited to see this product. I saw SHANY had other items but I wanted to see the quality before ordering anything else. This was a disappointment! I took it out of the box and all the layers opened up and wouldn&#x27;t stay shut. Not too thrilled about giving this as a gift to a granddaughter.</li>
            <li> nice palette, includes basically everything you need. I just wish the tiers were locking that way it wouldn&#x27;t come undone all the time and spill everything out... but really useful</li>
            <li> This is not good quality make up. I got it for my little girl and niece to play with while I put mine on. It works great for kid play. Container , while cool concept, is flimsy and slides every where making it not sturdy for application purposes.</li>
            <li> Perfect as a starter kit for a teen or just someone who likes to play with color.  I can not stress enough that I love Shany&#x27;s color payoff.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with the color of their products.</li>
            <li> I really like how portable and cute this is! I&#x27;ve bought a few for my cousins and I have a couple extras to give away as gifts. The quality is really amazing. Nothing is chalky. All the shadows are really smooth and blend really well. I&#x27;ve decided to keep one for myself because I like it so much!</li>
            <li> This product is designed in an round shape and it all fits together just so. So many ideas in this deluxe kit, the price is reasonalbe. Unsure if this product would with stand years of use though the way it fite together. Has 44 pieces for your imaganation.</li>
            <li> This makeup kit is an amazing find!  The kit has everything one would need for every day of the week and for every occasion.  What a fun set.  Am planning to order these for gifts for my nearest and dearest &amp;#34;girlfriends&amp;#34;.  They will definitely be thrilled with a package like this Shany Deluxe gift set.</li>
            <li> purchased this on a whim and thought if i didnt like it I could pass it on to my 15 year old neice... it is very useful and the foundations are well above expectations. all in all, great little kit to use for travel or daily usage.</li>
            <li> This would have been fine. It it was  broken  (the pressed powder ) and that wasn&#x27;t good for a Christmas present</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used the eyeshadows and I like how it blends in and not too cakey. The lip glosses are cool too. The mini brushes needs some work! They&#x27;re pitiful! How can anyone use them when the hairs are stuck together? They were breakable and I couldn&#x27;t use them on the make up. The applicator tips broke off and I hadn&#x27;t used them in a full week. The blush brush feels awkward with the bristles on my skin. If you&#x27;re getting this set consider getting a make up brush set cause those things won&#x27;t help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package came it was all intact. I liked this set so much I&#x27;ve put them in my beauty bag inside my purse. The colors are lovely. Worth the good price :)</li>
            <li> this deluxe makeup kit is amazing! especially if you&#x27;re on the go a lot and something this compact to take is great. the quality is great as always and the design is lovely would really recommend it</li>
            <li> What a great little set! I sent this to my friend for her birthday and she cannot stop raving about it. Perfect inexpensive, but very nice gift!</li>
            <li> The makeup kit was great, i use it every day. It just doesn&#x27;t stay up well by itself when open.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a birthday gift for my niece who loves to put on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;This will give her practice and many options to choose from.  She loves!</li>
            <li> I was very much surprised at the quality ofvthe product when you consider the very reasonable pricing. This was comparable to or better than products i&#x27;ve purchased from Ulta or Macys.</li>
            <li> This looks like a cute little kit for a tween or teenager just starting out. For the price and the products included, I would definitely purchase for any of my younger nieces!</li>
            <li> The cutest compact on the market. Vibrant colors! and durable I&#x27;ve dropped it like 3 times since I&#x27;ve bought it and the shadow have broken yet.</li>
            <li> I really love this. It is not long lasting but it is great for on the go. I love this. It stays on for about 10 hours but then its gone. but its long enough wear is great because no one wears makeup for more than 10 hours.</li>
            <li> Its great in use but i was hoping for lil bigger makeup box. Its def smaller then picture. quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> gave this to my niece for her 13th bday as an introduction to makeup.  she loved it and it was great to have a nice variety of color options.  we gave her a makeover right away and she not only looked great but was beaming in excitement over the gift.  Folds nicely/compactly and comes with brushes.  took away a star as the lipsticks seemed very bright/bold so we had supplemented so lipgloss in more muted toned.  i don&#x27;t know many that would wear those lipstick shades.</li>
            <li> This set is adorable! It&#x27;s actually the perfect size for on the go! I love the colors they are very universal and are trendy too! It has many layers that you can vary depending on your makeup needs. It&#x27;s perfect for fixing or touching up your makeup after a long day.</li>
            <li> Cheap. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The mirror fell out and the make up is cheap.</li>
