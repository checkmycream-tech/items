            <li> Same as other reviews... what is pictured is not what you get.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It was just what I expected!</li>
            <li> not worth returning.</li>
            <li> Some of the images of these samples look much bigger than their actual size, which makes it disappointing.</li>
            <li> but they left out the shadow and that made me ill.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> There are a few items that says random choice.</li>
            <li> missing half of the make up : (</li>
            <li> You must read the description, some people were confused on what all you get with this.  </li>
            <li> picture misleading, not happy, will not order again!</li>
            <li> All the bad reviews are people who go</li>
            <li> Did not receive the blush so ending up being a 7 pc kit :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice product but picture is misleading!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one compact, not three. There is only one jar, not three. The company chooses which one they wish to send.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a nice gift though.</li>
            <li> Bargain find!&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for small samples of my usual night serum &amp; eye gel to take on holiday, was pleased to come across this product, it&#x27;s perfect! Love the day moisturizer too and the rest of the contents are a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I note that 2 blushers are pictured just above the rest of the cosmetics and case whilst writing this review, these were not in my collection, but I&#x27;m not complaining still a great purchase!</li>
            <li> very happy, will buy again.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Did not receive the blush so ending up being a 7 pc kit :( not worth returning.</li>
            <li> Same as other reviews... what is pictured is not what you get.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this. Works perfect for travel. Had been buying these off ebay.</li>
            <li> skin care shorted by makeujp. too much emphasis on makeup</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.  Picture is totally misleading.  Shame on you EL!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it was not as advertised. I got one thing of blush and I did not get the eyeshadow at all. Will not recommend!</li>
            <li> missing half of the make up : (</li>
            <li> My mom loved this gift last Christmas. It contains a nice selection of EL products, and the makeup bag is extra pretty, with a luxurious feel, status print, and charm.</li>
            <li> I received the packge But It isn&#x27;t same the picture.there don&#x27;t have Eye shadow in the packge.I don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li> Fast easy .Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the cosmetic bag and 8 items in the bag.  It was just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an anniversary gift for my wife.  She found that there was lots of useful stuff in the add-on Makeup Kit.</li>
            <li> Amazing products- dynamite in a small package- gentle but effective-enhances your beauty-</li>
            <li> As a gift for a geriatric patient.  Loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed. I was really excited for the eye shadow, but that wasn&#x27;t in the set. The body moisturizer it does come with smells like a really old woman would like it. The creams seem nice. I&#x27;ll try them out when I get home later on tonight but they left out the shadow and that made me ill.</li>
            <li> Very good! I LOVED IT</li>
            <li> This was a outstanding purchase.  Have not used all the products as of this review, but have already ordered the Revitalizing cream.  A little bit goes a long way.  Would recommend this skincare makeup gift set to give to others or keep for yourself.  The cosmetic bag is roomy and designed nicely.</li>
            <li> Loved it!  Best deal for my buck!</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with my order</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item. Will order again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Holly C</li>
            <li> Let the girlfriend get it for herself and she loves it.  You must read the description, some people were confused on what all you get with this.  Don&#x27;t skip that part.</li>
            <li> Even if not everything included... with out reading the details... the title of this post still says 10 piece set...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVEN when you count the bag I had 9 pieces.  8 beauty products.  So not 10... or am I supposed to count the cardboard box it was shipped in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the point of splitting of the original set?</li>
            <li> Small samples but a nice addition to my cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The three creams that were suppose to come into the box where not included . I was waiting for this.</li>
            <li> this item was a rip off. In the picture it looks like your getting alot for your money, and it would make a great christmas gift. I was totally embarrassed when my wife open up the gift and said this is a free gift bag, that is given out free when making a purchase of Estee Lauder products. The proof to this is that the items in the bag said on them, items not for sale. I have always trusted Amazon, but in the future I will definitely be more cautious when making my purchases.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift that was really appreciated!</li>
            <li> I like this pack very much. All the bad reviews are people who go don&#x27;t know how to read a product description very well. There are a few items that says random choice. Hello! TSTL.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed purchasing my Estée Lauder items via Amazon. All components were present and the parcel arrived as promised. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this so much.... the products are great!!! Especially love the lipstick</li>
            <li> I just love all the products. I like the Modern Muse lotion. That smells so pretty. People have even commented on what a nice smelling perfume I have on. I just love it. and the mascara, eye shadows, etc. I always use Estee Lauder&#x27;s product. I would recommend it to every woman to buy.</li>
            <li> I have to give one start only because in that pictures is showing so many stuff and when the packet arrived I found out that those 3 creams are not included, piss me off because if u not putting this in the bag why would u put all this in the pic?</li>
            <li> Some of the images of these samples look much bigger than their actual size, which makes it disappointing.</li>
            <li> picture misleading, not happy, will not order again!</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase was a gift for my sister she loved it !!!!</li>
