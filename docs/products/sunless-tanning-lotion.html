            <li>This is really a great product.  </li>
            <li>Tanning in tanning beds and in the sun can be harmful, so this lotion is a great alternative.</li>

            <li>I really loved this lotion.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>They are both really good</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned redhead and have been using Toma&#x27;s self tanning lotion when I found Tanwise at Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Keep up the good work</li>
            <li>If you know how to apply self tanning lotion you will be very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and am so happy I bought it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll adapt your own method as you go / trial and error but the good part is those gloppy, darker sections you think will leave their mark</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and it made my skin look amazing,</li>
            <li>Reminds me of a nice tanning bed</li>
            <li>The color guide is kind of gross/dirty looking, but I put the lotion on before bed and then shower it off in the morning.  </li>
            <li>The color is really good, but what makes it way better than the BB stuff is the smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives even coverage, and a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wear gloves and exfoliate first for best results.</li>
            <li>The texture is amazing and very easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>I like the one hour because it&#x27;s just more golden and suits my fair but very warm toned coloring.</li>
            <li>All in all, I love this stuff - inexpensive, believable color and smells good.  </li>

            <li>By far the best tanning lotion I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>This is a really good color for me, an almost perfect match for my skin with a light natural tan.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best self tanner product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>My legs look amazing and so much more toned with this tanning</li>
            <li>and the color looks natural and awesome.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best self-tanner I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many self-tanners and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>I used it right before my senior pictures, which turned out amazing!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t show a tan as easily as most of the reviews stated.  </li>
            <li>The smell is better than most self tanners though.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had worked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my tan</li>
            <li>The second time I used gloves and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>And people noticed, too, more than one person asked where I was over the weekend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gives me better results than pre-lotioning does.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 100% even or flawless, which in part may be user error, but I don&#x27;t think most people would be looking as critically at your tan as you would.  </li>

            <li>It gets better as you get better at applying it.  </li>
            <li>Love Tanwise.</li>
            <li>Tan Wise wins in every category except one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tan</li>
            <li>Wise wins . .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many brands of self tanner over the years and Tanwise is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>So in love with this product.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff better then</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this too.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin, but I will tan in the sun.  </li>
            <li>The color is great -like a natural tan!</li>
            <li>Once applying to the skin and rubbing in, the colour changed to an almost cream colour, then to a nice tan colour once the product was absorbed.</li>
            <li>I use this to add more color to my shoulders without having to go through the entire application process all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>I wish I could return them but in an emergency I open both hoping that they would be fresh and perfect.</li>
            <li>I read so many reviews and tried to make sure I was putting it on the right way and all.</li>
            <li>Even parts where I thought it was streaky came out fine.</li>
            <li>So tan so quick!  </li>
            <li>but this one thus far is as close to perfect as I&#x27;ve encountered as far as quickest darkening is concerned.</li>
            <li>Tan wise really makes me feel comfortable in my own skin again- especially in the summer when everyone has that healthy glow.</li>
            <li>;) Smells fantastic, better than any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s gonna look tomorrow, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll be bomb.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is the smell.  </li>
            <li>It looks like an 8.00 dollar cream, but performs like a 30.00 cream; sweet.</li>
            <li>It has a nice color guide to help you when applying, but washes off in the shower leaving you with a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>The color is great, not Orange, but a little reddish tan, as if you have really been in the sun rather than an oompa loompa.&lt;br /&gt;-works with my olive tones, as well as with my friends very fair with red tone</li>
            <li>But after noticing new freckles in strange places I decided to find an alternative to the tanning bed, this product is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product and HIGHLY recommend it over a LOT of others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>And the price is remarkably lower than I expected.  </li>
            <li>However, when you take a shower most of the dark color wears off and leaves you with a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seems to dry more quickly and has a more greenish tint to it.  </li>
            <li>This is more of a brown tinge and is very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am fair-skinned and though I enjoy the sun, I want to be responsible about it.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice bronze color instantly and develops in an hour.  </li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and gives a golden glow.  </li>
            <li>even better then the spa&#x27;s spray tan, and it looks so natural.  </li>
            <li>Better off using Jergens Natural Glow.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice brown, tan color after showering next day -not orange at all.</li>
            <li>These will provide the most natural looking color.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, fast color and NO weird chemical smell.</li>
            <li>For those interested, Sun Goddess Will give you the darkest, with Sublime dark in second, but there are way too many negatives with them, Tan Wise wins by ALOT!</li>
            <li>recommend it to anyone looking to get a good dark tan.</li>
            <li>The price is also unbeatable, especially since its such a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just put it on for the first time and can tell it rocks.</li>
            <li>The first time I didnt use gloves and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying this 50/50 with regular lotion and it&#x27;s made the application more even, without a noticeable decrease in color (somehow).  </li>
            <li>I got a first class tan,</li>
            <li>I love this stuff but it has a short shelf life.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s produces a nice brown color instead of orange like all other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It went on very easily and dried pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>But the best part of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have that fake tan odor that is so prominent with other products...</li>
            <li>Go easy on the face, especially around the mouth, unless you want a mustache</li>
            <li>The color is very realistic, but rubs off.</li>
            <li>I used my hands and just washed them in between legs, arms, stomach and back, my hands look fine.</li>
            <li>Read a few awesome reviews and watched a few youtube videos about it, so I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>smell is great and fades SO naturally / evenly; no blotchiness (light / dark sections).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sunless tanning lotions still have a long way to go as far as perfecting themselves</li>
            <li>It looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>It really freaked me out when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using circular motions while applying really helps.</li>
            <li>I do not like it as much.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I rub</li>
            <li>I really hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li>It looks like a real tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the cherry almond smell, reminds me of Jergen&#x27;s, which is a definite plus over other lotions that smell so chemical.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t stained bedding, but I make sure to be dry before putting on old jammies.</li>
            <li>Here are the tanners I have tried, Tan Wise, Quick Tan, Sun Goddess, Fake Bake, Sublime, Jergens, Banana Boat, and whatever they use when they spray tan you by hand.</li>
            <li>HUGE mistake as when this stuff is on, it&#x27;s not natural looking and will bleed if you expose yourself to water / rain or humidity.  </li>
            <li>The product spread and covered well, and had a nice slick texture, like a silicon based tanning bed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not what I would consider dark, but it&#x27;s definitely more color than a gradual tanner.  </li>
            <li>Pricing a bit on the high side.</li>
            <li>Love this product because the green undertone prevents you from looking orange.</li>
            <li>It is golden, but not orange or yellow.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is the price, but I think it is worth it</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Minerals Fauxtan for a couple of years and was thrilled to find this product that works exactly the same at half the price.</li>
            <li>But my legs are always more pale and bloodless-looking since they don&#x27;t get the incidental sun exposure my arms,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to other tanning products I&#x27;ve used in the past, I think this is a really great deal.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It gives a very natural brown color.</li>
            <li>I have used many self tanners over the last 10 years and i am shocked at the good reviews that this received.</li>
            <li>I may try the mousse next time to see if the finish is a little more even.  </li>
            <li>I may try the mousse next time to see if the finish is a little more even.  </li>
            <li>(actually smells really</li>
            <li>It looks really natural and just brightens my look.  </li>
            <li>It looks so natural.  </li>
            <li>This gives me a natural color without orange-y look.</li>
            <li>Gives me a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again, and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is a little hard to get off the palms after applying, but washes off better if you use hand lotion on your hands first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pre-lotion knees or ankles, but I do gently buff those areas with a dry tissue after application.  </li>
            <li>my bare minerals faux tan!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural looking, it&#x27;s the only one I will buy now!!</li>
            <li>After showering it off, the smell is barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li>After showering it off, the smell is barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li>It works instantly because it&#x27;s tinted, which is great if you&#x27;re like me and hate to wait, but you need to work and rub it in fast to avoid streaking.</li>
            <li>I,bought three bottles and before I had gotten through the first, the second and third (which I had never broken the seal of)  had stopped having the green tint and applied orangy brown and streaky.</li>
            <li>It felt slightly grainy in my palm, but rubbing my hands together first made the gains dissolve.</li>
            <li>I paid 8.99, usually I use Quick Tan or So Bronze, each retailing for 20-30 dollars per product here in Canada.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re going to use it and get dressed right away, you may want to dress in something other than white, but I&#x27;ve found that as long as I let it dry completely (which isn&#x27;t long), it isn&#x27;t too big of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> It gets better as you get better at applying it.  </li>
            <li> Love Tanwise.</li>
            <li> Tan Wise wins in every category except one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tan</li>
            <li> Wise wins . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands of self tanner over the years and Tanwise is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> So in love with this product.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff better then</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this too.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin, but I will tan in the sun.  </li>
            <li> The color is great -like a natural tan!</li>
            <li> Once applying to the skin and rubbing in, the colour changed to an almost cream colour, then to a nice tan colour once the product was absorbed.</li>
            <li> I use this to add more color to my shoulders without having to go through the entire application process all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I wish I could return them but in an emergency I open both hoping that they would be fresh and perfect.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews and tried to make sure I was putting it on the right way and all.</li>
            <li> Even parts where I thought it was streaky came out fine.</li>
            <li> So tan so quick!  </li>
            <li> but this one thus far is as close to perfect as I&#x27;ve encountered as far as quickest darkening is concerned.</li>
            <li> Tan wise really makes me feel comfortable in my own skin again- especially in the summer when everyone has that healthy glow.</li>
            <li> ;) Smells fantastic, better than any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s gonna look tomorrow, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll be bomb.</li>
            <li> The only good thing is the smell.  </li>
            <li> It looks like an 8.00 dollar cream, but performs like a 30.00 cream; sweet.</li>
            <li> It has a nice color guide to help you when applying, but washes off in the shower leaving you with a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> The color is great, not Orange, but a little reddish tan, as if you have really been in the sun rather than an oompa loompa.&lt;br /&gt;-works with my olive tones, as well as with my friends very fair with red tone</li>
            <li> But after noticing new freckles in strange places I decided to find an alternative to the tanning bed, this product is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product and HIGHLY recommend it over a LOT of others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> And the price is remarkably lower than I expected.  </li>
            <li> However, when you take a shower most of the dark color wears off and leaves you with a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seems to dry more quickly and has a more greenish tint to it.  </li>
            <li> This is more of a brown tinge and is very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and though I enjoy the sun, I want to be responsible about it.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice bronze color instantly and develops in an hour.  </li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and gives a golden glow.  </li>
            <li> even better then the spa&#x27;s spray tan, and it looks so natural.  </li>
            <li> Better off using Jergens Natural Glow.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice brown, tan color after showering next day -not orange at all.</li>
            <li> These will provide the most natural looking color.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, fast color and NO weird chemical smell.</li>
            <li> For those interested, Sun Goddess Will give you the darkest, with Sublime dark in second, but there are way too many negatives with them, Tan Wise wins by ALOT!</li>
            <li> recommend it to anyone looking to get a good dark tan.</li>
            <li> The price is also unbeatable, especially since its such a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just put it on for the first time and can tell it rocks.</li>
            <li> The first time I didnt use gloves and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this 50/50 with regular lotion and it&#x27;s made the application more even, without a noticeable decrease in color (somehow).  </li>
            <li> I got a first class tan,</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but it has a short shelf life.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s produces a nice brown color instead of orange like all other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It went on very easily and dried pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> But the best part of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have that fake tan odor that is so prominent with other products...</li>
            <li> Go easy on the face, especially around the mouth, unless you want a mustache</li>
            <li> The color is very realistic, but rubs off.</li>
            <li> I used my hands and just washed them in between legs, arms, stomach and back, my hands look fine.</li>
            <li> Read a few awesome reviews and watched a few youtube videos about it, so I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> smell is great and fades SO naturally / evenly; no blotchiness (light / dark sections).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sunless tanning lotions still have a long way to go as far as perfecting themselves</li>
            <li> It looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> It really freaked me out when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using circular motions while applying really helps.</li>
            <li> I do not like it as much.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I rub</li>
            <li> I really hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li> It looks like a real tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the cherry almond smell, reminds me of Jergen&#x27;s, which is a definite plus over other lotions that smell so chemical.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t stained bedding, but I make sure to be dry before putting on old jammies.</li>
            <li> Here are the tanners I have tried, Tan Wise, Quick Tan, Sun Goddess, Fake Bake, Sublime, Jergens, Banana Boat, and whatever they use when they spray tan you by hand.</li>
            <li> HUGE mistake as when this stuff is on, it&#x27;s not natural looking and will bleed if you expose yourself to water / rain or humidity.  </li>
            <li> The product spread and covered well, and had a nice slick texture, like a silicon based tanning bed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I would consider dark, but it&#x27;s definitely more color than a gradual tanner.  </li>
            <li> Pricing a bit on the high side.</li>
            <li> Love this product because the green undertone prevents you from looking orange.</li>
            <li> It is golden, but not orange or yellow.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the price, but I think it is worth it</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals Fauxtan for a couple of years and was thrilled to find this product that works exactly the same at half the price.</li>
            <li> But my legs are always more pale and bloodless-looking since they don&#x27;t get the incidental sun exposure my arms,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to other tanning products I&#x27;ve used in the past, I think this is a really great deal.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It gives a very natural brown color.</li>
            <li> I have used many self tanners over the last 10 years and i am shocked at the good reviews that this received.</li>
            <li> I may try the mousse next time to see if the finish is a little more even.  </li>
            <li> I may try the mousse next time to see if the finish is a little more even.  </li>
            <li> (actually smells really</li>
            <li> It looks really natural and just brightens my look.  </li>
            <li> It looks so natural.  </li>
            <li> This gives me a natural color without orange-y look.</li>
            <li> Gives me a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again, and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get off the palms after applying, but washes off better if you use hand lotion on your hands first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t pre-lotion knees or ankles, but I do gently buff those areas with a dry tissue after application.  </li>
            <li> my bare minerals faux tan!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so natural looking, it&#x27;s the only one I will buy now!!</li>
            <li> After showering it off, the smell is barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li> After showering it off, the smell is barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li> It works instantly because it&#x27;s tinted, which is great if you&#x27;re like me and hate to wait, but you need to work and rub it in fast to avoid streaking.</li>
            <li> I,bought three bottles and before I had gotten through the first, the second and third (which I had never broken the seal of)  had stopped having the green tint and applied orangy brown and streaky.</li>
            <li> It felt slightly grainy in my palm, but rubbing my hands together first made the gains dissolve.</li>
            <li> I paid 8.99, usually I use Quick Tan or So Bronze, each retailing for 20-30 dollars per product here in Canada.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re going to use it and get dressed right away, you may want to dress in something other than white, but I&#x27;ve found that as long as I let it dry completely (which isn&#x27;t long), it isn&#x27;t too big of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t get on my sheets and was so glad it didn&#x27;t smell bad as it dried even more like other tan products do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dangerous like that) and found it to go on very easily.</li>
            <li> only bad thing I can say is I wish it gave you a little more color per application, but with its cheap price, I just do it a few days in a row to build color.</li>
            <li> I tan quickly, and for the past few years I&#x27;ve been using a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me any darker than Banana Boat deep bronze and was 3 times the price and ALOT harder to put on.</li>
            <li> A bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go in the sun  due to medical reasons.</li>
            <li> Also used this on my face mixed with a little of my facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used it, let it dry, slept on it, and then showered in the morning</li>
            <li> From red heads to people with dark toned skin already.</li>
            <li> The color is comparable to Banana Boat Summer Color Deep Dark.  </li>
            <li> I have used this several times and even though my hands turn DARK BROWN, the rest of my body holds the color for about a day or so</li>
            <li> It comes out very dark already, so the instant color helps you know where to spread out the color and rub it in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use gloves, I just carefully  wash the bottom part of my hands when I am done</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing you&#x27;ll want to be careful of, is that since it&#x27;s tinted, it can transfer to clothing/bedding.</li>
            <li> a side note, when you&#x27;re looking for a self-tanner, look for ones that have a GREEN tint to them, such as Tanwise.</li>
            <li> use sparingly as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> all of the other tanning products I&#x27;ve tried leave me orange and smelling like a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I can apply it and let it dry for a few minutes then put on shorts</li>
            <li> The sent isn&#x27;t bad, it has a light self-tanner smell but fades.</li>
            <li> it is a DARK lotion.</li>
            <li> But what&#x27;s really kickass is the activated smell, which is truly faint.  </li>
            <li> It works, goes on much like fake bake-</li>
            <li> If you want a more olive brown base, use this one.  </li>
            <li> it comes down to preference.</li>
            <li> my hands did get a little stained.</li>
            <li> This is worse than the tanning lotion from way back when before the company&#x27;s knew what they were doing!</li>
            <li> taking a glob of lotion then applying to whatever parts without thinking would prove messy.</li>
            <li> after 3 hours (longer if you can manage it), shower lightly (no soap / just rinse) and all will even out &#x27;in the wash&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fake Bake as well as nearly every drugstore self-tanner.</li>
            <li> The green tint cancels out any orange tones that you may get with self-tanners.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a thick, dark brown, muddy-looking lotion going on, with, I think, an almost slight green tint to it.</li>
            <li> Overall this isn&#x27;t a bad product, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it won&#x27;t give you a dark tan.</li>
            <li> say this is the lazy girl&#x27;s guide to tanning because I didn&#x27;t do all of the steps you&#x27;re &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to do-</li>
            <li> Not sure about any smell.</li>
            <li> I saw that this had the same ingredients as high-end, expensive Sunlabs self-tanner, with the exception of aloe vera, which is just an added moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is thick and green and hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging sucks and with glamour products like a self tanner, I like to feel like I&#x27;m treating myself.</li>
            <li> You seriously will not regret it.</li>
            <li> With BB, I can smell it as soon as I wake up (blech), but the Tanwise smells so faint that I thought it must not have worked the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> With BB, I can smell it as soon as I wake up (blech), but the Tanwise smells so faint that I thought it must not have worked the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not too bad, but it does have a little of the typical sunless tanner smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried several self tanning lotions in the past and hated how orange I looked.</li>
            <li> The WORST tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used since the late &#x27;80&#x27;s early &#x27;90&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> The trifecta of sunless tanners.ly kickass is the activated smell, which is truly faint.  </li>
            <li> I am using fake bake now though</li>
            <li> I use it at night and it rubs off on bedding really badly.</li>
            <li> If it did not rub off so bad, I would give it a 5.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> I had been looking on the internet for another and the prices are outrageous compared to Tanwise&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> In the bottle it looks horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried so many self tanners and this is the best!!! It&#x27;s so natural looking, it&#x27;s the only one I will buy now!! Also the the shimmering gel!! I don&#x27;t need to use gloves, I just carefully  wash the bottom part of my hands when I am done and I have no staining on my hands or palms! My tip is just to ensure you take your time applying it and blend it well!! Emily A.</li>
            <li> I did not like and would not order again, greasy and streaks.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t show a tan as easily as most of the reviews stated.  The smell is better than most self tanners though.  I wish it had worked better.</li>
            <li> By far the best tanning lotion I have EVER used. No streaky lines and it&#x27;s produces a nice brown color instead of orange like all other products I&#x27;ve tried. Great alternative to tanning in the summer time.</li>
            <li> I tan quickly, and for the past few years I&#x27;ve been using a tanning bed. But after noticing new freckles in strange places I decided to find an alternative to the tanning bed, this product is AMAZING!! I&#x27;ll be ordering more for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone looking to get a good dark tan. From red heads to people with dark toned skin already. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my tan and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Horrible. I have used many self tanners over the last 10 years and i am shocked at the good reviews that this received. The only good thing is the smell.  It is thick and green and hard to rub in. It didn&#x27;t make me any darker than Banana Boat deep bronze and was 3 times the price and ALOT harder to put on.</li>
            <li> I have tried several self tanning lotions in the past and hated how orange I looked. Love this product because the green undertone prevents you from looking orange. It looks like a real tan. The smell is the best I have found. The texture is amazing and very easy to rub in. Always wear gloves. If you know how to apply self tanning lotion you will be very satisfied with this product. Will never try something else.</li>
            <li> Overall this isn&#x27;t a bad product, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it won&#x27;t give you a dark tan.</li>
            <li> I really loved this lotion. I&#x27;ve just put it on for the first time and can tell it rocks. I picked it up on a whime at Sally&#x27;s, but none of the girls could tell me anything about it. I applied it without exfoliating, and without gloves(because I&#x27;m dangerous like that) and found it to go on very easily. It felt slightly grainy in my palm, but rubbing my hands together first made the gains dissolve. Once applying to the skin and rubbing in, the colour changed to an almost cream colour, then to a nice tan colour once the product was absorbed. The product spread and covered well, and had a nice slick texture, like a silicon based tanning bed lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other tanning products I&#x27;ve used in the past, I think this is a really great deal. I paid 8.99, usually I use Quick Tan or So Bronze, each retailing for 20-30 dollars per product here in Canada. I think this product is totally comparable. Also, it smells SO GOOOD. Reminds me of a nice tanning bed lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this 4 stars s because I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s gonna look tomorrow, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll be bomb. Also, the packaging sucks and with glamour products like a self tanner, I like to feel like I&#x27;m treating myself. It looks like an 8.00 dollar cream, but performs like a 30.00 cream; sweet. Buy this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning product I&#x27;ve ever tried. I am fair skinned and all of the other tanning products I&#x27;ve tried leave me orange and smelling like a tanning bed. This is not the case with Tanwise. This is more of a brown tinge and is very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning- it is a DARK lotion. It really freaked me out when I put it on. However, when you take a shower most of the dark color wears off and leaves you with a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say this is the lazy girl&#x27;s guide to tanning because I didn&#x27;t do all of the steps you&#x27;re &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to do- i.e. I didn&#x27;t exfoliate, I didn&#x27;t put lotion on my heels or hands or anything like that. The first time I didnt use gloves and my hands did get a little stained. The second time I used gloves and it worked perfectly. I recommend that you rub about a quarter sized amount on each of your areas- lower leg, upper leg, arm, stomach, etc. It worked for me! And people noticed, too, more than one person asked where I was over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So try Tanwise. You seriously will not regret it.</li>
            <li> 06/11/15 EDIT: Borax + soap will get the tanner off your hands.  White vinegar will kill the smell on your hands.  04/27/15 EDIT: I&#x27;ve been applying this 50/50 with regular lotion and it&#x27;s made the application more even, without a noticeable decrease in color (somehow).  I don&#x27;t pre-lotion knees or ankles, but I do gently buff those areas with a dry tissue after application.  This gives me better results than pre-lotioning does.  The color is comparable to Banana Boat Summer Color Deep Dark.  This is a really good color for me, an almost perfect match for my skin with a light natural tan.  It is golden, but not orange or yellow.  It&#x27;s not what I would consider dark, but it&#x27;s definitely more color than a gradual tanner.  I have pretty fair skin, but I will tan in the sun.  (I don&#x27;t, but I can.)  But my legs are always more pale and bloodless-looking since they don&#x27;t get the incidental sun exposure my arms, etc. do.  So I just use sunless tanner to make my legs look not-undead from April-October.  The color guide is kind of gross/dirty looking, but I put the lotion on before bed and then shower it off in the morning.  The color is really good, but what makes it way better than the BB stuff is the smell.  It smells like cherry-almond out of the bottle, which is the best-smelling tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  But what&#x27;s really kickass is the activated smell, which is truly faint.  With BB, I can smell it as soon as I wake up (blech), but the Tanwise smells so faint that I thought it must not have worked the first time I used it.  After showering it off, the smell is barely perceptible.  It&#x27;s not 100% even or flawless, which in part may be user error, but I don&#x27;t think most people would be looking as critically at your tan as you would.  I may try the mousse next time to see if the finish is a little more even.  All in all, I love this stuff - inexpensive, believable color and smells good.  The trifecta of sunless tanners.ly kickass is the activated smell, which is truly faint.  With BB, I can smell it as soon as I wake up (blech), but the Tanwise smells so faint that I thought it must not have worked the first time I used it.  After showering it off, the smell is barely perceptible.  It&#x27;s not 100% even or flawless, which in part may be user error, but I don&#x27;t think most people would be looking as critically at your tan as you would.  I may try the mousse next time to see if the finish is a little more even.  All in all, I love this stuff - inexpensive, believable color and smells good.  The trifecta of sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanner product I&#x27;ve found. It works instantly because it&#x27;s tinted, which is great if you&#x27;re like me and hate to wait, but you need to work and rub it in fast to avoid streaking. I&#x27;ve found that using circular motions while applying really helps. It&#x27;s also a natural deep tan color with absolutely no orange. But the best part of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have that fake tan odor that is so prominent with other products... Even the ones that claim there is no odor. This one truly has no stinky odor. It is scented, but it&#x27;s more like a lotion scent, and is nothing like the fake tan scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing you&#x27;ll want to be careful of, is that since it&#x27;s tinted, it can transfer to clothing/bedding. So if you&#x27;re going to use it and get dressed right away, you may want to dress in something other than white, but I&#x27;ve found that as long as I let it dry completely (which isn&#x27;t long), it isn&#x27;t too big of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this product to touch up areas of my body that haven&#x27;t been exposed to the sun, in contrast to areas that have. My example would be that when I wear short sleeve shirts and go out in the sun, I get an instant farmers tan. I use this to add more color to my shoulders without having to go through the entire application process all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product. Will definitely buy again, and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  It gets better as you get better at applying it.  Be sure to wear gloves and exfoliate first for best results.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff. A bottle goes a long way.The color is great -like a natural tan! I can&#x27;t go in the sun  due to medical reasons. Tan wise really makes me feel comfortable in my own skin again- especially in the summer when everyone has that healthy glow. So happy I found it!</li>
            <li> Love Tanwise. Here are the tanners I have tried, Tan Wise, Quick Tan, Sun Goddess, Fake Bake, Sublime, Jergens, Banana Boat, and whatever they use when they spray tan you by hand. Tan Wise wins in every category except one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tan Wise wins . . .&lt;br /&gt;-Ease of application&lt;br /&gt;-Smell (actually smells really good)&lt;br /&gt;-Skin reaction (no bumps, zits, rashes)&lt;br /&gt;-Even fade&lt;br /&gt;-Color! The color is great, not Orange, but a little reddish tan, as if you have really been in the sun rather than an oompa loompa.&lt;br /&gt;-works with my olive tones, as well as with my friends very fair with red tone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I can say is I wish it gave you a little more color per application, but with its cheap price, I just do it a few days in a row to build color. For those interested, Sun Goddess Will give you the darkest, with Sublime dark in second, but there are way too many negatives with them, Tan Wise wins by ALOT!</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals Fauxtan for a couple of years and was thrilled to find this product that works exactly the same at half the price. It looks the same, smells the same and develops into the same brown (not orange) color. It is a little hard to get off the palms after applying, but washes off better if you use hand lotion on your hands first.</li>
            <li> Best self tanning product I have ever used, no streaking, no orange. Definitely use gloves to apply. Pricing a bit on the high side.</li>
            <li> So tan so quick!  There are two formulas.  I have tried both and prefer the one hour formulation.  It gives a nice bronze color instantly and develops in an hour.  It is moisturizing and gives a golden glow.  It looks really natural and just brightens my look.  My legs look amazing and so much more toned with this tanning product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the regular version.  I do not like it as much.  It seems to dry more quickly and has a more greenish tint to it.  If you want a more olive brown base, use this one.  I like the one hour because it&#x27;s just more golden and suits my fair but very warm toned coloring. I can apply it and let it dry for a few minutes then put on shorts and it looks great!  They are both really good it comes down to preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands of self tanner over the years and Tanwise is my favorite. Easy to apply, fast color and NO weird chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and even though my hands turn DARK BROWN, the rest of my body holds the color for about a day or so and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned redhead and have been using Toma&#x27;s self tanning lotion when I found Tanwise at Sally&#x27;s.  I loved the cherry almond smell, reminds me of Jergen&#x27;s, which is a definite plus over other lotions that smell so chemical.  I was also thrown by the greenish tint and thought it was out of date, but it wasn&#x27;t.  It went on very easily and dried pretty quickly.  Went to bed with it on and it didn&#x27;t get on my sheets and was so glad it didn&#x27;t smell bad as it dried even more like other tan products do.  Next morning, WHAT A TAN!!  It looks like I&#x27;ve been tanning all month and isn&#x27;t streaky and looks perfect!  I think I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product and HIGHLY recommend it over a LOT of others I&#x27;ve tried.  I got a first class tan, even better then the spa&#x27;s spray tan, and it looks so natural.  Love, love, love it.  And the price is remarkably lower than I expected.  I had been looking on the internet for another and the prices are outrageous compared to Tanwise&#x27;s price. Keep up the good work Tanwise and PLEASE stay at Sally&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t run out.  Thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> This left streaks on me. What color did stay, came off in the pool. I read so many reviews and tried to make sure I was putting it on the right way and all. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I used it right before my senior pictures, which turned out amazing! and it made my skin look amazing, perfect color too!!</li>
            <li> The WORST tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used since the late &#x27;80&#x27;s early &#x27;90&#x27;s! No matter how much I rub I can&#x27;t get it all to absorb. Have to get a towel and wipe off the excess. This is worse than the tanning lotion from way back when before the company&#x27;s knew what they were doing! Better off using Jergens Natural Glow. Will be throwing the entire bottle away and will NEVER recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is really a great product.  It&#x27;s the very best sunless tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Will purchase this again and again.  It looks so natural.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff!! It works, goes on much like fake bake-it&#x27;s a thick, dark brown, muddy-looking lotion going on, with, I think, an almost slight green tint to it. Must wear gloves! Go easy on the face, especially around the mouth, unless you want a mustache ;) Smells fantastic, better than any I&#x27;ve used. Reminds us of almond extract or cherry chocolates. Leaves a nice brown, tan color after showering next day -not orange at all. My daughter and I love it and those who have smelled it agree with us!! I really hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner lotion on the market at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of self-tanners. This gives me a natural color without orange-y look. I am fair-skinned and though I enjoy the sun, I want to be responsible about it. This tanner gives me a desirable tan without the sun. Not sure about any smell. I don&#x27;t notice any. It hasn&#x27;t stained bedding, but I make sure to be dry before putting on old jammies. On my list of Stuff Not to Run Out Of</li>
            <li> So in love with this product. I&#x27;ve tried many self-tanners and this is the best by far. It has a nice color guide to help you when applying, but washes off in the shower leaving you with a natural looking tan. The sent isn&#x27;t bad, it has a light self-tanner smell but fades. The only problem I had with this product is that you have to wear gloves, or use a tanning mitt because the color guide did stain my hands. The price is also unbeatable, especially since its such a great product. Best tanner ever!</li>
            <li> Did NOT work for me. I am using fake bake now though and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I picked this up at my local sally&#x27;s beauty along with the pre tan body scrub and the shimmer perfection cream . Read a few awesome reviews and watched a few youtube videos about it, so I decided to try it out. So glad I did. I like this stuff better then my bare minerals faux tan! Gives me a natural looking tan. I have an olive skin tone and this stuff makes it look like I have the perfect tan. I will buy this stuff again and again! I would totally recommend it to anyone! I used my hands and just washed them in between legs, arms, stomach and back, my hands look fine. Also used this on my face mixed with a little of my facial moisturizer. Love the smell of this too. It has sorta like a cherry almond smell. It also leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Great color! Reccomend to everyone! Only suggestion is get a mitt! It will stain your hand! Color goes on truly brown not orange! In the bottle it looks horrible!</li>
            <li> I love this product and am so happy I bought it. Tanning in tanning beds and in the sun can be harmful, so this lotion is a great alternative. It comes out very dark already, so the instant color helps you know where to spread out the color and rub it in. I used it, let it dry, slept on it, and then showered in the morning and the color looks natural and awesome. Even parts where I thought it was streaky came out fine. The smell is also pleasant. The only downside is the price, but I think it is worth it and I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> The color is very realistic, but rubs off. I use it at night and it rubs off on bedding really badly. The smell is not too bad, but it does have a little of the typical sunless tanner smell. If it did not rub off so bad, I would give it a 5.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but Tanwise is amazing!!! I will never use anything ever again to make it look like I just got back from vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives even coverage, and a nice glow. I apply using a tanning mitt and have never had any problem with it staining. I did not care for it after I had only used it once, but after I applied it the day after, it gave me the results that I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but it has a short shelf life. I,bought three bottles and before I had gotten through the first, the second and third (which I had never broken the seal of)  had stopped having the green tint and applied orangy brown and streaky. I Have the mousse as well and that has maintained its shelf life perfectly.  I wish I could return them but in an emergency I open both hoping that they would be fresh and perfect. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> in brief : one application does what 4 applications of Jergens does however, un-like Jergens, DO NOT attempt to apply then leave for an occasion. HUGE mistake as when this stuff is on, it&#x27;s not natural looking and will bleed if you expose yourself to water / rain or humidity.  if you&#x27;ve 3 hours to yourself, THEN apply; rub into your skin until lotion has penetrated. use sparingly as a little goes a long way. apply in sections i.e. face, neck, arms, etc.  taking a glob of lotion then applying to whatever parts without thinking would prove messy. you&#x27;ll adapt your own method as you go / trial and error but the good part is those gloppy, darker sections you think will leave their mark do not. after 3 hours (longer if you can manage it), shower lightly (no soap / just rinse) and all will even out &#x27;in the wash&#x27;. smell is great and fades SO naturally / evenly; no blotchiness (light / dark sections).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sunless tanning lotions still have a long way to go as far as perfecting themselves but this one thus far is as close to perfect as I&#x27;ve encountered as far as quickest darkening is concerned. great purchase and I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Great self tanner.Have purchased this product twice now.love it</li>
            <li> I saw that this had the same ingredients as high-end, expensive Sunlabs self-tanner, with the exception of aloe vera, which is just an added moisturizer. It is by far the best self-tanner I have used. I&#x27;ve used Fake Bake as well as nearly every drugstore self-tanner. It gives a very natural brown color. It looks like a real tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, when you&#x27;re looking for a self-tanner, look for ones that have a GREEN tint to them, such as Tanwise. These will provide the most natural looking color. The green tint cancels out any orange tones that you may get with self-tanners.</li>
