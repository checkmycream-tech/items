            <li>This nail paint is OK.</li>
            <li>I wish there are better non-toxic nail paint for kids that are more affordable.</li>
            <li>but I found that the more coats I put on the faster it comes off.</li>
            <li>piggys look adorable  </li>
            <li>received many compliments</li>
            <li>I will definately be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>love piggy polish.</li>
            <li>but she does love to have her nails painted.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll order any more</li>
            <li>hoping it comes off as easy as it went on :)</li>
            <li>It is safe, comes in many colors, and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>very nice for young ones :)</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my niece and they were great as far as not smelling, etc.</li>
            <li>Love that this product is non-toxic and kid friendly.  </li>
            <li>Chips off easily</li>
            <li>The polish remover also works well and does not have strong odor.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect polish for little girls.  </li>
            <li>Thought it was fun idea to paint my baby&#x27;s toenails &amp; it did look cute FOR ONE DAY.  </li>
            <li>When she plays in or with water most of it comes right off.</li>
            <li>It peels off very easily, but I love that I do not  have to worry that my 2 year old is putting her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li>does, however, come off super easy.</li>
            <li>You can find items like this which are kids friendly at Marshalls or TJ Maxx, but not always, and definately can NOT find them at baby r us, target, or walmart....</li>
            <li>Great product, loved how fast it dried.  </li>
            <li>No stinky smell, strongly recommend to kids who is fancy on pretty nails!</li>
            <li>Cute colors and almost odorless which is great for use on little ones</li>
            <li>If the nail polish spills, you can clean it up with water.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this product and would recommend to any mommy of a little girl! :)</li>
            <li>, I think the time frame is good enough.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>Also, this variety does not cover the nail well and the varnish is not good compared to an Essie, but this is perfect for a child.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and dries super fast.  </li>
            <li>Perks of pretty fast but worth it as its safe.</li>
            <li>But considering we cannot use a top coat like we would for an adult</li>
            <li>This was so much fun to use.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews says that the polish rubs right off.</li>
            <li>If she paints her entire finger which happened to be the case, it can be removed very easily.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s first nail polish set...</li>
            <li>Our daughter kept looking at her toes and fingers and saying \\&quot;pretty, pretty\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I also love that it seems to dry super fast</li>
            <li>This product is great, I purchased this for my 2 1/2 year old, wondering of course if she&#x27;d still long enough for the paint to dry, it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>&quot; much sums it up.</li>
            <li>I was really upset when I received the package, the nail polish remover was leaked and spilled all over.</li>
            <li>but I think that was because my toddler was rough on her toes:).</li>
            <li>However, the paint chips off of my daughter&#x27;s finger nails hours after we apply it (the paint on her toe nails stays on much longer though).  </li>
            <li>Like this paint that it dries fast and no chemicals but wished it stayed on the nails longer.</li>
            <li>I used it on her for pictures and her toes look adorable in pink</li>
            <li>We will continue getting in different colors.&lt;br /&gt;The remover that is packed seems to work well, although we mostly just scratch off the old polish.</li>
            <li>My daughter had managed to have it all off her toes within 48 hours and she is only 4 months old without being able to crawl.</li>
            <li>Great colors, stays on longer, but hard to remove with regular remover</li>
            <li>I love doing my daughter&#x27;s nails without worrying about potential health problems associated with regular polish.</li>
            <li>May for older kiddies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The paint dries quickly, the colors are to true to the pictures and there is little to no smell.</li>
            <li>The nail polish remover doesn&#x27;t stink like normal nail polish either.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old had been wanting to wear polish ever since she saw older kids putting some on.</li>
            <li>Only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, comes off easily.</li>
            <li>Fantastic nail polish set for little kids.  </li>
            <li>painted my 10 month old toenails with this piggy paint because it says all natural.</li>
            <li>My 2.5 yr old loves finger nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Got this set for my almost 3 year old.</li>
            <li>She is 2 years old</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural and edible, we let her paint her nails by herself, or her mommies nails.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 2 &amp; 3 ye old granddaughters.  </li>
            <li>My 2 1/2 year daughter loves the mini (not mani) pedis that I give her and to finish with this pretty girlie pink polish completes the experience.</li>
            <li>Just use regular adult polish.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a big thumb sucker, but we are comfortable with her having this on her</li>

            <li> My 2.5 yr old loves finger nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Got this set for my almost 3 year old.</li>
            <li> She is 2 years old</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural and edible, we let her paint her nails by herself, or her mommies nails.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 2 &amp; 3 ye old granddaughters.  </li>

            <li> Just use regular adult polish.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a big thumb sucker, but we are comfortable with her having this on her</li>
            <li> Yes it does not last long on their nails</li>
            <li> they were dry enough for her to crawl and walk around!  </li>
            <li> The nail polish doesn&#x27;t last as long as regular nail polish, but that&#x27;s not unusual with kids products.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s smeared on my couch and bed for the long haul.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a long lasting nail polish, then either you have to be very careful OR look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Also takes 10 years and a day to dry.  </li>
            <li> It does only last a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to someday try the base and top coat for myself to see if that will help make it last longer.</li>
            <li> It also did not take very long to dry after just blowing on her little feet for about a minute</li>
            <li> Bought this for my little girl&#x27;s nails in an to use something less toxic than traditional nail polish.  </li>
            <li> But, the smell is minimal and you just have to work it a little harder.  </li>
            <li> and I have not yet seen her mess up her nails.</li>
            <li> The polish remover works, but with a little elbow grease.</li>
            <li> Now I can paint my little girls nails and not worry about her chewing on them.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t want her to put on harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> The polish chips off within a few hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something you want to do everyday...  </li>
            <li> It chips off within a few hours</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> and I painted her little toe nails!  </li>
            <li> just wish it would have stayed on a little longer!</li>
            <li> $30 is a lot to spend on 2 really small bottles of nail polish &amp; remover.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to resort to using my harsh chemical remover on her little piggies.</li>
            <li> Poor quality brushes in polish!</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time removing the nail polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> Horrible colors for a child!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I purchased these for my niece and they were great as far as not smelling, etc. The nail polish remover will not remove nail polish that is not non-toxic. Also, this variety does not cover the nail well and the varnish is not good compared to an Essie, but this is perfect for a child. If she paints her entire finger which happened to be the case, it can be removed very easily.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s first nail polish set... the color is nice and it stayed for more then 3 days.  No stinky smell, strongly recommend to kids who is fancy on pretty nails!</li>
            <li> Thought it was fun idea to paint my baby&#x27;s toenails &amp; it did look cute FOR ONE DAY.  Polish won&#x27;t stay on so I had to keep retouching on daily basis.  $30 is a lot to spend on 2 really small bottles of nail polish &amp; remover.  You don&#x27;t even need remover since product doesn&#x27;t stay on...</li>
            <li> Poor quality brushes in polish!</li>
            <li> This product, is great. It is safe, comes in many colors, and goes on smooth. Our daughter kept looking at her toes and fingers and saying \\&quot;pretty, pretty\\&quot;. Thats \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; much sums it up. You can find items like this which are kids friendly at Marshalls or TJ Maxx, but not always, and definately can NOT find them at baby r us, target, or walmart....we looked. If you want to be safe, go with this.</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 year daughter loves the mini (not mani) pedis that I give her and to finish with this pretty girlie pink polish completes the experience. She says she&#x27;s a princess and she always has to have on sandals to show off her polished toes. Some reviews says that the polish rubs right off. I will say that the product lasts about 3 days. But considering we cannot use a top coat like we would for an adult and she tends to spend a good length of time bathing, I think the time frame is good enough. The polish remover also works well and does not have strong odor.</li>
            <li> Great colors, stays on longer, but hard to remove with regular remover</li>
            <li> Horrible colors for a child! Cute packaging but the colors are very bright and Inappropriate for a young girl under 10.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. My 2 year old had been wanting to wear polish ever since she saw older kids putting some on. But I didn&#x27;t want her to put on harsh chemicals. This is a great nail polish that stays on, I feel good about and she loves! No smell either. The remover works great too and no smell!&lt;br /&gt;I will defiantly buy this again!</li>
            <li> This was so much fun to use.  The colors are great and I really appreciated getting a nail polish remover that is just as safe as the polish.  It did start to chip off of my baby&#x27;s nails after about a week, but by then it was time to take it off.</li>
            <li> I love doing my daughter&#x27;s nails without worrying about potential health problems associated with regular polish. Chips off easily but I think they sell a top coat to prevent that... In any case, doesn&#x27;t bother me as she still enjoys getting her nails painted.</li>
            <li> It peels off very easily, but I love that I do not  have to worry that my 2 year old is putting her fingers in her mouth. I also love that it seems to dry super fast - she shakes her hands like 5 times and scampers off and I have not yet seen her mess up her nails.</li>
            <li> I love Piggy Paint because it is non-toxic and I am at ease knowing my girls are using this product.  The nail polish remover didn&#x27;t work too well.  I had a difficult time removing the nail polish.</li>
            <li> This nail paint is OK. The colors are bright but you do need to repaint every 2 days. I wish there are better non-toxic nail paint for kids that are more affordable.</li>
            <li> The nail polish remover doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Unfortunately, I had to resort to using my harsh chemical remover on her little piggies.</li>
            <li> I was really upset when I received the package, the nail polish remover was leaked and spilled all over.</li>
            <li> When we got the package in the mail the bottle of remover was leaking all over. Plus a Very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> The colors were very cute. The Polish started to chip within a day but I think that was because my toddler was rough on her toes:).</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my baby. It&#x27;s great. It does only last a few days but I found that the more coats I put on the faster it comes off. If I only put on one coat it lasts the longest.</li>
            <li> My  daughter asked me to get her this for her baby and the babies piggys look adorable  received many compliments</li>
            <li> My daughter loves that she can have her nails painted and I like that it&#x27;s the non-toxic type. Only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, comes off easily. When she plays in or with water most of it comes right off. The polish remover works, but with a little elbow grease.</li>
            <li> painted my 10 month old toenails with this piggy paint because it says all natural. hoping it comes off as easy as it went on :)</li>
            <li> This product is great, I purchased this for my 2 1/2 year old, wondering of course if she&#x27;d still long enough for the paint to dry, it&#x27;s fantastic! The paint dries quickly, the colors are to true to the pictures and there is little to no smell. And my daughter loves getting her toes painted now! I will definately be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> very nice for young ones :)</li>
            <li> I love that there is a SAFE, non-toxic, odorless nail polish for the mini girlie girls out there!  My daughter is 8 months and I painted her little toe nails!  The polish is beautiful in color and it has no odor!  It also did not take very long to dry after just blowing on her little feet for about a minute they were dry enough for her to crawl and walk around!  I love love love this product and would recommend to any mommy of a little girl! :)</li>
            <li> My 2.5 yr old loves finger nail polish.  This is the perfect polish for little girls.  It goes on easy and dries super fast.  I love that it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients.  The remover takes some elbow grease - it&#x27;s low on chemicals so it doesn&#x27;t work the same as mom&#x27;s polish remover.  But, the smell is minimal and you just have to work it a little harder.  Good product.</li>
            <li> love piggy polish. Now I can paint my little girls nails and not worry about her chewing on them.</li>
            <li> Got this set for my almost 3 year old. I hoped that if we painted her nails maybe she would stop chewing them. No such luck but she does love to have her nails painted. It dries quickly &amp; I skip the hair dryer part.</li>
            <li> Love that this product is non-toxic and kid friendly.  However, the paint chips off of my daughter&#x27;s finger nails hours after we apply it (the paint on her toe nails stays on much longer though).  When it was shipped to us the nail polish remover spilled in transit.  We lost about a third of the bottle.  I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll order any more but we will definitely finish what we have.</li>
            <li> Like this paint that it dries fast and no chemicals but wished it stayed on the nails longer.</li>
            <li> I bought these nail polishes to paint my toddlers toe nails. The polish chips off within a few hours. Ever tried to paint a toddlers toe nails??  It&#x27;s not something you want to do everyday...  It chips off within a few hours but it&#x27;s smeared on my couch and bed for the long haul.  Also takes 10 years and a day to dry.  Pass!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic nail polish set for little kids.  This nail polish is non-toxic, so I don&#x27;t have to think twice about letting my toddlers use it.  The nail polish remover doesn&#x27;t stink like normal nail polish either.  If the nail polish spills, you can clean it up with water.  The nail polish doesn&#x27;t last as long as regular nail polish, but that&#x27;s not unusual with kids products.  I&#x27;m hoping to someday try the base and top coat for myself to see if that will help make it last longer. The colors in this particular set are also perfect for my girls.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a baby gift, the mother loved it. Thought it was very nice to have since all babies chew on their fingers.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my little girl&#x27;s nails in an to use something less toxic than traditional nail polish.  This stuff is such a joke.  It comes off in their mouth, in the bath, if you touch their nails at all.  You are constantly reapplying it, or pulling chunks out of their mouth.  Said screw it and just put some of my nail polish on her and it&#x27;s been on for going on a week without any chipping.  Friends have similar experiences.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Just use regular adult polish.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  Yes it does not last long on their nails but I like that it is not toxic  and that is what I liked about this product.  However the polish remover I don&#x27;t like.  Having to soak the nail for abt 30 sec to remove does not work on a 3 yr old.  May for older kiddies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes a bit expensive. But worth it to me to keep icky stuff off my child.</li>
            <li> No smell,safe and secure,the children also liked.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES this stuff. It&#x27;s crazy. She is 2 years old and she goes nuts.&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s natural and edible, we let her paint her nails by herself, or her mommies nails. She&#x27;s a big thumb sucker, but we are comfortable with her having this on her thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;It does, however, come off super easy. I actually consider it a benefit, but people should know. If you are looking for a long lasting nail polish, then either you have to be very careful OR look elsewhere. If you are looking for something fun and safe, this is a great product. We will continue getting in different colors.&lt;br /&gt;The remover that is packed seems to work well, although we mostly just scratch off the old polish.</li>
            <li> Great product, loved how fast it dried.  Bought for my 2 &amp; 3 ye old granddaughters.  Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> Cute colors and almost odorless which is great for use on little ones however chips very easily. My daughter had managed to have it all off her toes within 48 hours and she is only 4 months old without being able to crawl. I used it on her for pictures and her toes look adorable in pink just wish it would have stayed on a little longer!</li>
            <li> Perks of pretty fast but worth it as its safe.</li>
