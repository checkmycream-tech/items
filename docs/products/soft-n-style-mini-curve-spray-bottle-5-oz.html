            <li>The curved design is perfectly handy, and you can adjust the amount of spray by twisting the knob on the front of the muzzle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;There are two things that might need revision in it, thus the 3-star rating:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li>Love this spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I love it for pool/beachside use.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have gotten more than one, but I didn&#x27;t and eventually it broke.</li>
            <li>so I am buying more.</li>
            <li>However, I just bought it because of its design as I am somewhat a spray bottle collector and like interesting designs.  </li>
            <li>But, basically, it&#x27;s an interesting bottle to look at.  </li>
            <li>I like to mix many conditioners and hair oils together</li>
            <li>Love them,</li>
            <li>Love the shape of this bottle.</li>
            <li>It works. :)</li>
            <li>Love this spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be good for travel, but after the first use, it stopped working.</li>
            <li>Contoured to the shape of my hand, I can easily grasp and fire them faster than Wyatt Earp at the OK Corral.</li>
            <li>Brilliant use of gravity to help you get the last bit of water out of it when you are in a hurry out the door.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for her to manage on her own, and it sits in a little basket along with some hand towels for her to clean as she pleases.  </li>
            <li>but the nozzle gets clogged really easily</li>
            <li>I think this problem can be solved easily with a curved straw.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find anything like it anywhere so it easily became &amp;</li>
            <li>While this is a major design flaw, it is attractive looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for misting my hair when it&#x27;s super dry.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because of it&#x27;s cool design and content capacity is ideal for daily use for styling products however the acrylic body did break after it fell off the bathroom counter</li>
            <li>, it produces a fine</li>
            <li>This mini spray bottle is super cute.</li>
            <li>This little spray bottle is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Great handy little bottle.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive but doesn&#x27;t seem cheap at all.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find the same one here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it was cheap.</li>
            <li>This bottle is light weight but does not stands up even when you fill it with water.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I need to spray my hair in order to tame it and this bottle is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Works great as a dog training device while walking for my 6 month old German Shepherd pup, recommended for sure!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s irregular shape and small size was perfect for hanging on my shower rack</li>
            <li>I use it to spray water for my hair, clean tables, mirrors and furniture.</li>
            <li>SUPER cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>Good product, but could balance better when it is empty.</li>
            <li>Bottle has a strong, very fine mist spray action.  </li>
            <li>but if you play with the tip of the nossle you can find a spraying setting that is perfect for you: it can be anything from a straight up heavy stream like you are squeezing out of a water bottle to a fine mist.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s flimsy and doesn&#x27;t stay upright unless full.  </li>
            <li>Like some other reviewers posted - great for disciplining dogs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little sprayer.</li>
            <li>Great little water bottle for washing my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>They are great for travel and everyday use around the house and travel.</li>
            <li>so this helps to make styling in the morning nice and simple.</li>
            <li>Its worth 1 penny.</li>
            <li>Fits my hand perfectly, and small enough to fit in a pocket of my golf bag.....</li>
            <li>Just the right size for my needs.</li>
            <li>The one we have had for a year fell on some pavement at just the right angle to crack</li>
            <li>Keep shopping around for the right spritz bottle.</li>
            <li>I put one in each room, and they are so just the right size that i can carry one around with me.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for my needs.  </li>
            <li>Great little spray bottle!</li>
            <li>A nice little stream comes out of it, so it&#x27;s easy to aim and teach kitty to stay away from places we don&#x27;t want her playing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, which is great because it&#x27;s not an eyesore in my house.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little spray bottle that fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
            <li>We bought the first one for a teacher of my daughter.</li>
            <li>We all love it and the next day we ordered another one for ourselves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for over a month</li>
            <li>Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Bottles were exactly as advertised and work very well.  </li>
            <li>The spray comes out evenly (no drips) and covers a large area.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent, has adjustable nozzle to shoot mist or stream</li>
            <li>This is a nice little spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I really like this sprayer.  </li>
            <li>Very well made</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how this squirts a straight squirt</li>
            <li>sprays more water than expected but works well</li>
            <li>but it does leak so make sure to empty it before traveling anywhere with it.</li>
            <li>downside is it runs out of liquid rather fast</li>
            <li>Very well made</li>
            <li>So if you want to give hair a pretty good soaking, it only takes a few squirts.  </li>
            <li>It costs a little more (especially for the size), but feels comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li>As nice as a small spray bottle can be</li>
            <li>I like that you do not have to prime them a bunch to get a decent spray.</li>
            <li>It seems weird to say that I love a spray bottle, but I do love this spray bottle.</li>
            <li>They are very cheap but not cheap in construction.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>It was smaller and does not dominate my counter, and it adds just the right amount of spray to my hair with out soaking it for renewing my hair style.  </li>
            <li>so I am afraid it&#x27;s sleek design and easy grip neck are great but might not be as durable as compared to other spray bottles.  </li>
            <li>It works, but it tips over if you set it down when not 100% filled.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that our bottle takes a little bit of maneuvering to fit the top back on after filling with water, but overall, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I have young boys, who wake up with bed head.</li>
            <li>My 2.5 year old enjoys &#x27;cleaning&#x27;</li>
            <li>Wish the all natural homemade bug repellant I put in it worked as well as the bottle......</li>
            <li>Really its a spray bottle so very low expectations which it met without issue.</li>
            <li>I bought this to spritz my hair, but the nozzle only has a straight stream spray and can&#x27;t do a mist spray which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The curve of the bottle fits my smallish hands well, and the plastic is of a decent quality for such an inexpensive item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray mechanism</li>
            <li>Because of the size ratio of the bottle to squirt top, it&#x27;s also harder to set down without having it knocking over.</li>
            <li>It came as expected and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Also, being small, they are easy to station around the condo for that sudden, conniving canine ambush.</li>
            <li>When you hold the bottle in your hand to spray it, it tips back so that when there is only a little bit of water left, it all flows to the back right corner, and that is right where the tube picks it up for spraying.  </li>
            <li>Initially bought it for some natural stain remover to hang in the laundry room off the side of wire shelving.</li>
            <li>Nice cheap and small spray bottle that doesn&#x27;t look ugly like ones at DIY store.&lt;br</li>

            <li> A nice little stream comes out of it, so it&#x27;s easy to aim and teach kitty to stay away from places we don&#x27;t want her playing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, which is great because it&#x27;s not an eyesore in my house.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little spray bottle that fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
            <li> We bought the first one for a teacher of my daughter.</li>
            <li> We all love it and the next day we ordered another one for ourselves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for over a month</li>
            <li> Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Bottles were exactly as advertised and work very well.  </li>
            <li> The spray comes out evenly (no drips) and covers a large area.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent, has adjustable nozzle to shoot mist or stream</li>
            <li> This is a nice little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like this sprayer.  </li>
            <li> Very well made</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how this squirts a straight squirt</li>
            <li> sprays more water than expected but works well</li>
            <li> but it does leak so make sure to empty it before traveling anywhere with it.</li>
            <li> downside is it runs out of liquid rather fast</li>
            <li> Very well made</li>
            <li> So if you want to give hair a pretty good soaking, it only takes a few squirts.  </li>
            <li> It costs a little more (especially for the size), but feels comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li> As nice as a small spray bottle can be</li>
            <li> I like that you do not have to prime them a bunch to get a decent spray.</li>
            <li> It seems weird to say that I love a spray bottle, but I do love this spray bottle.</li>
            <li> They are very cheap but not cheap in construction.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It was smaller and does not dominate my counter, and it adds just the right amount of spray to my hair with out soaking it for renewing my hair style.  </li>
            <li> so I am afraid it&#x27;s sleek design and easy grip neck are great but might not be as durable as compared to other spray bottles.  </li>
            <li> It works, but it tips over if you set it down when not 100% filled.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that our bottle takes a little bit of maneuvering to fit the top back on after filling with water, but overall, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have young boys, who wake up with bed head.</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old enjoys &#x27;cleaning&#x27;</li>
            <li> Wish the all natural homemade bug repellant I put in it worked as well as the bottle......</li>
            <li> Really its a spray bottle so very low expectations which it met without issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this to spritz my hair, but the nozzle only has a straight stream spray and can&#x27;t do a mist spray which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The curve of the bottle fits my smallish hands well, and the plastic is of a decent quality for such an inexpensive item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray mechanism</li>
            <li> Because of the size ratio of the bottle to squirt top, it&#x27;s also harder to set down without having it knocking over.</li>
            <li> It came as expected and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Also, being small, they are easy to station around the condo for that sudden, conniving canine ambush.</li>
            <li> When you hold the bottle in your hand to spray it, it tips back so that when there is only a little bit of water left, it all flows to the back right corner, and that is right where the tube picks it up for spraying.  </li>
            <li> Initially bought it for some natural stain remover to hang in the laundry room off the side of wire shelving.</li>
            <li> Nice cheap and small spray bottle that doesn&#x27;t look ugly like ones at DIY store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a shoddy piece of plastic that breaks apart with the first time you drop it.</li>
            <li> It really is small and needs to be refilled often, but it has a decent seal and will work for a long time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you need a small squirt bottle.</li>
            <li> Nice and conveniently small, but unfortunately they leaked like almost all of them seem to do (look on Amazon reviews).</li>
            <li> Unless you put water in these, they constantly fall over due to the design.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to screw the top back on since everything is at such odd angles.</li>
            <li> and it sprays well every single time.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make a spray mist, just a single stream</li>
            <li> When the liquid is low, and you hold the bottle facing downwards, the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; inside goes to the other (empty) corner of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert on plastic bottles, but this is definitely a better-made product than your average dollar store squirter.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I tried a regular sized spray bottle but found it too bulky to carry around from room to room.</li>
            <li> This sprayer gives a pretty thick spray of water - not a fine mist.  </li>
            <li> Really, the only negative thing I can say about the product is the small reservoir and a rather unstable footing.  </li>
            <li> This water bottle falls over if its empty or not full enough.  </li>
            <li> design but not really functional, with only a little liquid</li>
            <li> And also because of the curvature, it&#x27;s harder to get it to &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; off the side of anything like a bucket or rail.</li>
            <li> Bottle is a little unbalanced (especially when not full) for my liking</li>
            <li> bottle does tend to tip over when there&#x27;s very little fluid within, but it doesn&#x27;t leak when it does</li>
            <li> Other than that sturdy and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a spray bottle with &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; twist settings and does what spray bottles do.</li>
            <li> One down side is that it&#x27;s not very sturdy...</li>
            <li> What I really like about it is that the mechanism used to pull the oil from the body is sized perfectly so as not to cause the sprayer to get clogged up or malfunction.</li>
            <li> If you plan on using it at least daily</li>
            <li> , I use them for rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide and they have not weakened or thinned out due to the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> The wide spray setting broke after about 3 months of use, but it still works as a small jet spray</li>
            <li> Only downside is that is uncomfortable to use for a somewhat long period of time.</li>
            <li> have a little pug/frenchie who loves to scavenge on walks and this baby keeps him from eating things he will spend a day throwing up.</li>
            <li> but thats due to the small bottle size.</li>
            <li> A little overpriced in my opinion</li>
            <li> So now this product has become a waste of my time.  </li>
            <li> If you need a small bottle, I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Small yet efficient.</li>
            <li> Small spray bottle, does what it is intended to do.  </li>
            <li> Also, they are sturdy for small bottles.</li>
            <li> Not much more than a novelty item.</li>
            <li> I have two ferocious Boston Terriers that need additional \\&quot;reinforcement\\&quot; to not bark within our small condo unit and thus disturb our neighbors.</li>
            <li> This bottle right here, scares the crap out of my dog.</li>
            <li> I had hard time keeping this up.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a broken sprayer.  </li>
            <li> It is also poorly balanced continually falling over.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use it as a child spritz water bottle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one of my dogs LOVES licking up the aftermath of my water barrage</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, and soon they respond when I merely brandish it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(Nothing wrong if you keep them in your garden, but</li>
            <li> but it does stand up easily on it&#x27;s base as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worst item i have ever bought in my life dies not spray to well</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a shoddy piece of plastic that breaks apart with the first time you drop it. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I have young boys, who wake up with bed head. I use this bottle to spray their hair before I comb it. It works great, and awesome quality for a plastic bottle. The bottle also fits in my medicine cabinet perfectly.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need to spray my hair in order to tame it and this bottle is perfect.  As stated in the description, it is mini in that it&#x27;s only 5oz.  It works great.  If you need a small bottle, I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Bottles were exactly as advertised and work very well.  Love the size and the amount of 5 oz. meets my needs ...</li>
            <li> Target used to have these but changed them.  This is the best spray bottle I&#x27;ve ever used!  It&#x27;s also great for arthritic hands and for traveling as it fits well in a suitcase.  I own four.</li>
            <li> This bottle right here, scares the crap out of my dog. Perfect for training your pup, he&#x27;s stopped chewing on things he&#x27;s not supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it sometimes to squirt the dangler in the back of my throat.</li>
            <li> No frills, but no disappointments. It really is small and needs to be refilled often, but it has a decent seal and will work for a long time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this spray bottle! The curved design is perfectly handy, and you can adjust the amount of spray by twisting the knob on the front of the muzzle. Sometimes my daughter uses it as a pretend water gun. #winning</li>
            <li> Works great but the sprayer handle broke after using it four times!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of it&#x27;s cool design and content capacity is ideal for daily use for styling products however the acrylic body did break after it fell off the bathroom counter so I am afraid it&#x27;s sleek design and easy grip neck are great but might not be as durable as compared to other spray bottles.  For the price...I will consider ordering another.</li>
            <li> I really like this sprayer.  I bought around 5 of these from Tar-J.  They are very cheap but not cheap in construction.  Really, the only negative thing I can say about the product is the small reservoir and a rather unstable footing.  But they are ergonomically perfect for my hands.  You can adjust the nozzle to very fine mist.  I use it to spray water for my hair, clean tables, mirrors and furniture.</li>
            <li> It is well built and very comfortable to hold. We bought the first one for a teacher of my daughter. We all love it and the next day we ordered another one for ourselves.</li>
            <li> This water bottle falls over if its empty or not full enough.  While this is a major design flaw, it is attractive looking.</li>
            <li> Great little sprayer. Contoured nicely for easy spraying.. Good value too.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray bottle to squirt my cats when they misbehave. It does the job. It&#x27;s small, which is great because it&#x27;s not an eyesore in my house. I might buy more to keep one in every room!</li>
            <li> Love this spray bottle. Just the right size for my needs. Great nozzle and adjustments. Very well made</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I use it for. Only downside is that is uncomfortable to use for a somewhat long period of time. Quality made.</li>
            <li> I would never buy this product. Squirts nothing but air. Never worked. I gave up trying to fix it and tossed it in the basket.</li>
            <li> item quality is good: very easy to control spray.</li>
            <li> Works great as a dog training device while walking for my 6 month old German Shepherd pup, recommended for sure!</li>
            <li> Small yet efficient. Good to take on traveling.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a broken sprayer.  It was smaller and does not dominate my counter, and it adds just the right amount of spray to my hair with out soaking it for renewing my hair style.  I was even able to put in a hanger on the wall under the mirror and it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to screw the top back on since everything is at such odd angles. i think i may have already stripped the threads  since now the cap is lose. It is also poorly balanced continually falling over.</li>
            <li> This little spray bottle is wonderful.  I use it to apply oil to my scalp and body. What I really like about it is that the mechanism used to pull the oil from the body is sized perfectly so as not to cause the sprayer to get clogged up or malfunction.</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old enjoys &#x27;cleaning&#x27; so we purchased this spray bottle for her.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for her to manage on her own, and it sits in a little basket along with some hand towels for her to clean as she pleases.  The only issue is that our bottle takes a little bit of maneuvering to fit the top back on after filling with water, but overall, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Small spray bottle, does what it is intended to do.  I love it for pool/beachside use.  Doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> Very handy, easy to spray and convenient to take anywhere in totes or luggage.  Inexpensive but doesn&#x27;t seem cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I threw this away. I thought it would be good for travel, but after the first use, it stopped working. When it did work, it squirts out a STREAM not a spray.</li>
            <li> I did not realize this until later on but if you play with the tip of the nossle you can find a spraying setting that is perfect for you: it can be anything from a straight up heavy stream like you are squeezing out of a water bottle to a fine mist. I have beautiful 3C hair so this helps to make styling in the morning nice and simple.</li>
            <li> Great handy little bottle. Adjustable nozzle mist or stream.</li>
            <li> I got this to &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; my cat, and it&#x27;s perfect. A nice little stream comes out of it, so it&#x27;s easy to aim and teach kitty to stay away from places we don&#x27;t want her playing.</li>
            <li> Arrived with no nozzle.  So now this product has become a waste of my time.  Otherwise it is as described.</li>
            <li> Great little water bottle for washing my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> bottle cracked at the bottom before i even got a chance to use it. now it leaks and will not hold the liquid.</li>
            <li> it is just what I was looking for. Very nice and easy to hold. Could not ask for more and a great price</li>
            <li> Unless you put water in these, they constantly fall over due to the design.  The sprayer works though. I purchased another brand as I just didn&#x27;t like that these couldn&#x27;t stand upright w/o fluid in them.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little spray bottle. I bought one similar years ago from a brick and mortar store. I wish I would have gotten more than one, but I didn&#x27;t and eventually it broke. I was so happy to find the same one here on Amazon. They are great for travel and everyday use around the house and travel. I like that you do not have to prime them a bunch to get a decent spray. Also, they are sturdy for small bottles. I highly recommend if you need a small squirt bottle. I bought 3.</li>
            <li> worst item i have ever bought in my life dies not spray to well</li>
            <li> It seems weird to say that I love a spray bottle, but I do love this spray bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for over a month and it sprays well every single time. I like the way it fits in my hand and it&#x27;s only about six inches tall so it&#x27;s perfect for tossing in the diaper bag. Also, it hasn&#x27;t leaked!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how this squirts a straight squirt it doesn&#x27;t must at all.</li>
            <li> Very good doesn&#x27;t leak, great for travel, I can pretty much tak it anyware, it has a good spray effect.</li>
            <li> sprays more water than expected but works well</li>
            <li> Pretty decent, has adjustable nozzle to shoot mist or stream</li>
            <li> Excellent for our use in getting the attention of the dogs...</li>
            <li> SUPER cheap and flimsy. I cant believe I paid for this. Its worth 1 penny. Go to a beauty supply store and buy there.</li>
            <li> Great for travel but it does leak so make sure to empty it before traveling anywhere with it. Other than that sturdy and gets the job done.  Great little spray bottle!</li>
            <li> It came as expected and looks exactly like the picture. The only problem I have is I dropped it once and it broke so thank goodness it was cheap.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make a spray mist, just a single stream</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers posted - great for disciplining dogs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a little pug/frenchie who loves to scavenge on walks and this baby keeps him from eating things he will spend a day throwing up. Fits in the pocket so perfectly I can even give him a quick squirt without even taking it out. The one we have had for a year fell on some pavement at just the right angle to crack so I am buying more.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s flimsy and doesn&#x27;t stay upright unless full.  However, I just bought it because of its design as I am somewhat a spray bottle collector and like interesting designs.  I&#x27;ll probably use it to spritz water in my hair, and that&#x27;s not too often especially when I get buzz cuts.  But, basically, it&#x27;s an interesting bottle to look at.  Not much more than a novelty item.</li>
            <li> The curve of the bottle fits my smallish hands well, and the plastic is of a decent quality for such an inexpensive item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray mechanism works well, it produces a fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle does tend to tip over when there&#x27;s very little fluid within, but it doesn&#x27;t leak when it does so I just fill it up and all&#x27;s well.</li>
            <li> This bottle is light weight but does not stands up even when you fill it with water.  It is not a spritz bottle, the nozzle just squirts out the water.  I was unable to use it as a child spritz water bottle. Keep shopping around for the right spritz bottle.</li>
            <li> I have two ferocious Boston Terriers that need additional \\&quot;reinforcement\\&quot; to not bark within our small condo unit and thus disturb our neighbors. Previously, I tried a regular sized spray bottle but found it too bulky to carry around from room to room. I also tried a couple of squirt guns. Nice and conveniently small, but unfortunately they leaked like almost all of them seem to do (look on Amazon reviews). Undaunted, I vowed to persevere in my quest for the ultimate weapon in this never-ending primal struggle between man and beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, found it with these smallish spray bottles. Contoured to the shape of my hand, I can easily grasp and fire them faster than Wyatt Earp at the OK Corral. Also, being small, they are easy to station around the condo for that sudden, conniving canine ambush. Unfortunately, one of my dogs LOVES licking up the aftermath of my water barrage so I may need to up the ante in the future.</li>
            <li> Wish the all natural homemade bug repellant I put in it worked as well as the bottle......Fits my hand perfectly, and small enough to fit in a pocket of my golf bag.....can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s longevity yet, but spray mechanism works great.</li>
            <li> This sprayer gives a pretty thick spray of water - not a fine mist.  So if you want to give hair a pretty good soaking, it only takes a few squirts.  We like that.  When you hold the bottle in your hand to spray it, it tips back so that when there is only a little bit of water left, it all flows to the back right corner, and that is right where the tube picks it up for spraying.  Brilliant use of gravity to help you get the last bit of water out of it when you are in a hurry out the door.</li>
            <li> I like to mix many conditioners and hair oils together but the nozzle gets clogged really easily so i use this strictly for hair oils. I like it.</li>
            <li> Bottle has a strong, very fine mist spray action.  Very good action.  It&#x27;s irregular shape and small size was perfect for hanging on my shower rack but it does stand up easily on it&#x27;s base as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is it runs out of liquid rather fast but thats due to the small bottle size.</li>
            <li> I put one in each room, and they are so just the right size that i can carry one around with me.</li>
            <li> I used it to squirt my cats when they misbehave.  Works like a charm, and soon they respond when I merely brandish it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little spray bottle that fits comfortably in your hand. I use it to dilute Essential Peppermint Oil. The spray comes out evenly (no drips) and covers a large area.</li>
            <li> Initially bought it for some natural stain remover to hang in the laundry room off the side of wire shelving. It works, but it tips over if you set it down when not 100% filled. Because of the size ratio of the bottle to squirt top, it&#x27;s also harder to set down without having it knocking over. And also because of the curvature, it&#x27;s harder to get it to &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; off the side of anything like a bucket or rail.</li>
            <li> Good product, but could balance better when it is empty. It sometimes falls over  on the counter without liquid in it</li>
            <li> This mini spray bottle is super cute. I use it in my kitchen as a watered-down bleach dispenser for dishes/stains.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;There are two things that might need revision in it, thus the 3-star rating:&lt;br /&gt;- The wide spray setting broke after about 3 months of use, but it still works as a small jet spray&lt;br /&gt;- When the liquid is low, and you hold the bottle facing downwards, the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; inside goes to the other (empty) corner of the bottle. I think this problem can be solved easily with a curved straw.</li>
            <li> Sprays nicely, easy to squeeze, durable, can pick up liquid in the bottom the best while using normally, it is angled on the bottom to provide perfect suctioning of liquids. Nice size for packing, for easy storage on shelves as well, I use them for rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide and they have not weakened or thinned out due to the harsh chemicals. Love them,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for misting my hair when it&#x27;s super dry. The curved nature of the bottle makes it a perfect fit for slim hands and it doesn&#x27;t LEAK like most bottles.</li>
            <li> Really its a spray bottle so very low expectations which it met without issue. No complaints it works like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> As nice as a small spray bottle can be</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shot as fair as I need to with my cats.  But the size is plus (you  don&#x27;t know its in your pocket) and it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for making thermal water.</li>
            <li> Nice cheap and small spray bottle that doesn&#x27;t look ugly like ones at DIY store.&lt;br /&gt;(Nothing wrong if you keep them in your garden, but different purpose.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice design but not really functional, with only a little liquid I had hard time keeping this up.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Jury&amp;#34; still out on this product...</li>
            <li> I bought this to spritz my hair, but the nozzle only has a straight stream spray and can&#x27;t do a mist spray which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows the best things in life have curves! Love the shape of this bottle. A little overpriced in my opinion but I couldn&#x27;t find anything like it anywhere so it easily became &amp;#34;worth it&amp;#34;. Other than that, it&#x27;s a spray bottle with &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; twist settings and does what spray bottles do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert on plastic bottles, but this is definitely a better-made product than your average dollar store squirter.  It costs a little more (especially for the size), but feels comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t leak.  If you plan on using it at least daily it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It does the job. One down side is that it&#x27;s not very sturdy...so it tips over easily...but doesn&#x27;t leak or anything. I&#x27;m using it to spray at my dog who keeps going after my cats. It works. :)</li>
            <li> Love this spray bottle.  Just the right size for my needs.  Great nozzle and adjustments.  Very well made</li>
            <li> Sprayer works great and is consistent. Bottle is a little unbalanced (especially when not full) for my liking but I should have anticipated that seeing the shape.</li>
