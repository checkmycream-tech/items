            <li>Great value for the dollar.</li>
            <li>Excellent, better shave ever</li>
            <li>This is a good, affordable alternative to Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>My husband received a sample of this razor and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>nice shave, great price</li>
            <li>It would be great if these came with more razors.</li>
            <li>and I love the price!</li>
            <li>Yes, it would be nice to have</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Like others say, it would be nice to be able to buy just replacement blades, instead of always having to buy the handle...holder...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My legs are smooth, yes!  </li>
            <li>More blades in a cartridge just makes it more unwieldy.</li>
            <li>Does an ok job, I can get 2 shaves out of each.</li>
            <li>Gives a better shave than one too.</li>
            <li>I shave my head and my face, and this is a fantastic blade, even compares to the Gillette Mach sumpinerudder...</li>
            <li>pack available but for this price</li>
            <li>folks who need to be clean shaved and</li>
            <li>I liked Bic&#x27;s earlier version of replaceable blades better.</li>
            <li>He highly recommends this razor - clean shave, easy to use on goatee.</li>
            <li>The Bic&#x27;s handle is cheap and disposable, but the blades are comparable, which is what really matters.</li>
            <li>Replaces my last BIC Advanced that I bought up in bulk and can&#x27;t find any more.</li>
            <li>Bic not only filled an area of the razor market figuratively, but also literally, with this 4 bladed razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems to be a decent razor.  </li>
            <li>but I can live with that</li>
            <li>This particular product does the same job as the other more costly brands.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>only concern is that the product might not be available next time.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s $1.62 for a razor that will last quite a long time, certainly longer than a disposable.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clog because razors are far enough apart.</li>
            <li>at least clean shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering how often I shave, and how much money spent per year that equates to, a 40% savings on that adds up to quite a bit in the long run.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best close shave I have ever had.....blade&#x27;s last a long time.....Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love it and I love the price!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a decent razor.  My legs are smooth, yes!  I have a horrible time finding a decent, affordable razor due to dry skin and coarse hair.  This one seems to work well, I don&#x27;t feel any stubble or missed spots.  It would be great if these came with more razors.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and my face, and this is a fantastic blade, even compares to the Gillette Mach sumpinerudder...can&#x27;t remember if it&#x27;s 3 or 4. Like others say, it would be nice to be able to buy just replacement blades, instead of always having to buy the handle...holder...thingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful, reusable blade and great for us po&#x27; folks who need to be clean shaved and handsome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, at least clean shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> This particular product does the same job as the other more costly brands.&lt;br /&gt;For the cost of the entire package you would might get one blade from the competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor nicks but I can live with that, they all will do that depending on you shaving speed/technique.&lt;br /&gt;You will save a bundle with this product.  With the other brands you&#x27;ll spend 30+ dollars for the same shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package I purchased actually had a bonus blade included.  The handle is not metal but who cares.&lt;br /&gt;Most people probably have a collection of handles they never use anyway.  Yes, it would be nice to have just the&lt;br /&gt;replacement pack available but for this price not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that the product might not be available next time.</li>
            <li> Excellent, better shave ever</li>
            <li> I liked Bic&#x27;s earlier version of replaceable blades better. More blades in a cartridge just makes it more unwieldy.</li>
            <li> A great razor...........Nice close shave. Can use several times before changing blades. Hard to find in stores. Great value for the dollar.</li>
            <li> Closest shave and feels great!</li>
            <li> This is a good, affordable alternative to Gillette Fusion blades. The Bic&#x27;s handle is cheap and disposable, but the blades are comparable, which is what really matters. Gillette only makes razors with 3 or 5 blades. Bic not only filled an area of the razor market figuratively, but also literally, with this 4 bladed razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering how often I shave, and how much money spent per year that equates to, a 40% savings on that adds up to quite a bit in the long run.</li>
            <li> Does an ok job, I can get 2 shaves out of each.</li>
            <li> BEATS GILLETE HANDS DOWN. WILL GET DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SHAVES OVER COMPARABLE GILLETTE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My husband received a sample of this razor and absolutely loved it.  So I had to order some for him to have in stock.  He highly recommends this razor - clean shave, easy to use on goatee.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s $1.62 for a razor that will last quite a long time, certainly longer than a disposable. Gives a better shave than one too. especially if you have a course beard. Replaces my last BIC Advanced that I bought up in bulk and can&#x27;t find any more.</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Doesn&#x27;t clog because razors are far enough apart. No safety wires so be careful but I like the closer shave. I shave my head and face so I get tough, long hairs and this guy never clogged. I&#x27;ve used several other razors and I was always clearing the hair manually. It also stayed incredibly sharp even after shaving my head...other brands are starting to fade when I got to my face. I forgot to mention I cannot find just the refill cartridges...what is wrong with razor manufacturers now? They offer a razor plus handle for less than just a refill cartridge, they don&#x27;t offer just refill cartridges for shaving systems, it&#x27;s like they are sniffing glue or something.</li>
            <li> BEST RAZOR FOR THE MONEY...PERIOD!  I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for over 10 years and have tried every razor out there.  Trust me, there is no better razor on the market for the money.  There is no need to spend the extra $$$$$$$$$ for those &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; razors.</li>
            <li> nice shave, great price</li>
