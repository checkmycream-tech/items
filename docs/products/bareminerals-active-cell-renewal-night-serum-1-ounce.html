            <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>I have mild acne as well and this product is great for it.</li>
            <li>I started using this about 2 weeks ago, every night before bed, and have seen excellent results as far as how supple and moisturized my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is a miracle, and I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon, because i&#x27;ll probably be out in a month.</li>
            <li>It works like magic overnight.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, used it for months now.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with this serum.</li>
            <li>I have to order some more asap.</li>
            <li>Just started using it will review more in a month or 2.</li>
            <li>Love the way it goes on and is not runny.</li>
            <li>Most important, my wife likes it!  </li>
            <li>This is the magic wrinkle eraser.  </li>
            <li>and I wake up with my skin clearer, more supple, moisturized, and with any acne reduced.</li>
            <li>dropped better.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>However most cosmetics are overpriced and this is in line with comparable products.</li>
            <li>I figured I would give it one more try.  </li>
            <li>I also received a sample and after using it the first time I awoke in the morning to bright, glowing skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I wake up with a nice smooth face, free of redness.</li>
            <li>The serum itself is not oily at all and absorbs very quickly</li>
            <li>And when I used this with glow pads my skin felt and looked flawless and other people noticed it too which was huge.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my skin is glowing and the fine lines are smoothed out.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth for days after use.</li>
            <li>I am giving this a 2 star instead of 1 because it works in the sense where its light weight and moisturzing</li>
            <li>My face is smooth, glowing, refreshed.</li>
            <li>I am breaking out again ( which never happened when I was using serum and Glow pads) and just in general it does not look as good.</li>
            <li>I had a sample and couldnt beleive how good my makeup looked the next day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve done this for two weeks straight and literally my skin hasn&#x27;t ever looked so good, not even in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I havent had anything that worked this good in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt so pretty in my life!</li>
            <li>It is pricey but the result is worth it.</li>
            <li>I put the serum on my skin and it was absorbed immediately.  </li>
            <li>I could feel my skin soak it up right away.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, no residue, soaks right in.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product as a promo, so didn&#x27;t try it right away.  </li>
            <li>I love bare menirals</li>
            <li>This is another favorite skin care product of mine ( along with the Bare Minerals Skincare Glow Pads) and together when I used the serum and</li>
            <li>at first I thought it was a miracle lotion it felt like nothing that I had ever used.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it is not for people who have problematic skin.</li>
            <li>As stated in the posted description; I did notice a drastic change in hydration within the first 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Kept my face soft and smooth without making me break out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a face lift or even botox, but I really see some tightening!</li>
            <li>If you want to wake up and look 5 years younger after the first use... GET THIS!!!</li>
            <li>And I can tell that now that I have run out of this and the other Glow Pads that my skin is NOT as nice.</li>
            <li>Many times I order a product &amp; wonder if it really does anything, but in the case I actually see a difference in my face in the morning.</li>
            <li>This serum is worth every penny and was much cheaper than a high end product I had been using.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone that wants a face pick me up.</li>
            <li>Seem very durable.</li>
            <li>This product is reasonably priced for the size.  </li>
            <li>Normal!</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and can never find anything that can calm down my face and not irritate or cause more pimples.</li>
            <li>This works particularly well on my neck.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of using too much every night and using up the bottle very fast, however now I just put a TINY dot on each cheek and rub it all over my face.</li>
            <li>It is a high price for a tiny bottle, however it is SO worth it.</li>
            <li>I add one pearl sized drop to a pump of oil free moisturizer (generic brand from a local drugstore) and I use it just at night after washing my face.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels much softer, not rough or even itchy like before, yay!</li>
            <li>and im WOW!</li>
            <li>This is the first product where I actually notice a difference every morning that I wake up!</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel moist and soft.</li>
            <li>You only need a pea-sized drop and while the product feels very oily, no breakouts occured.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend trying this product if you are prone to break out or have oily skin or adult acne.</li>
            <li>and my skin is baby soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little price-y, but well worth the results.</li>
            <li>It is quite pricey, but you use so little that it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I wait about 10 min before I put my moisturizer on ( Bare Minerals for combination skin)</li>
            <li>It also does a superb job of evening out skin tone, something that myriad other products fail to do for my freckled, pale</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is non toxic and you can actually feeling it working and healing............</li>
            <li>before bed: wash face and neck into hairline with liquid black soap, and really rub it in and massage face (should take about 2 mins).</li>
            <li>Rinse with lukewarm water, dry and then fill the dropper on the active cell renewel serum, squirt it into the palm of hand and with a finger focus first on under eye and upper check area, next to nose, on both sides, and then use the rest everywhere else, including neck and hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have ridiculously dry and sensitive skin, I have wasted so much money on products that irritate or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even put on anymore HEAVY creams on my face at night or in the day, I use spf 20 bare minerals moisturizer in the day (for normal to dry)...</li>
            <li> After a few nights of following the regime, I noticed this morning that my skin was smoother, brighter, and not dry.  </li>
            <li> I put on a tiny dab every other night before bed</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin and have to be very cautious with what I use as I am a 30 and still will break out if I use the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviewers about Bare Escentuals Active Cell Renewal Night Serum.  </li>
            <li> I normally cake myself at night with thick creams for my extremely dry and flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> I had a little sun spot (the size of a pencil eraser) under my left eye that has lightened, ALMOOOOST disappeared.</li>
            <li> It is $$$ for such a tiny bottle but at least a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The make up counters at those department stores sell similar products that range from $75 to $150 per small bottle.  </li>
            <li> Then I started using black soap on my face and noticed that my skin was a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> They felt like they were burning my skin (I have a slight case of roscea).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it, and thought it made my face sticky, so it collected dust for a few months.</li>
            <li> I was I&#x27;ve used all types of products from low end to quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> I could be wrong but it made me suspicious enough that i am returning the product.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product!  </li>
            <li> I am 37, and smoked for 20 years, so my skin was definitely not in great shape.</li>
            <li> serum was thin and watery.. will not be ordering this product again...</li>
            <li> I always had bad skin and always had to wear makeup to cover scars and stuff.</li>
            <li> holy crap.</li>

            <li> This works particularly well on my neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this stuff for about a week now and im WOW! I&#x27;ve never felt so pretty in my life! I love bare menirals i use their make up and stuff..plus this?? Omg amazing😃</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my skin  texture and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviewers about Bare Escentuals Active Cell Renewal Night Serum.  I also received a sample and after using it the first time I awoke in the morning to bright, glowing skin tone.  So I purchase a bottle immediately.  It is pricey but the result is worth it.</li>
            <li> i have had this for a while and it was WAY more expensive elsewhere. I didn&#x27;t use it, and thought it made my face sticky, so it collected dust for a few months. Then I started using black soap on my face and noticed that my skin was a lot smoother. I remembered this stuff and started using it again. holy crap. my skin looks amazing.  I am 37, and smoked for 20 years, so my skin was definitely not in great shape. Also, I started breaking out, and then I started this routine:&lt;br /&gt;EVERYNIGHT before bed: wash face and neck into hairline with liquid black soap, and really rub it in and massage face (should take about 2 mins). Rinse with lukewarm water, dry and then fill the dropper on the active cell renewel serum, squirt it into the palm of hand and with a finger focus first on under eye and upper check area, next to nose, on both sides, and then use the rest everywhere else, including neck and hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done this for two weeks straight and literally my skin hasn&#x27;t ever looked so good, not even in my early 20&#x27;s. This stuff is a miracle, and I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon, because i&#x27;ll probably be out in a month.</li>
            <li> I like this Serum. It makes my face feel moist and soft.</li>
            <li> This product is majorly impressive -- I almost didn&#x27;t believe the reviews until I tried the sample as a promo. It works like magic overnight. I could visibly see the reduced scars on my face and my skin felt softer and smoother. I love it. You only need a pea-sized drop and while the product feels very oily, no breakouts occured. Just let the product soak on your face and you&#x27;ll wake to see the results in the morning. It&#x27;s a little price-y, but well worth the results.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night. Love how it makes my face so soft and smooth. I have been using this product for a couple years now and will not switch from it. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product, used it for months now. I have adult acne and can never find anything that can calm down my face and not irritate or cause more pimples. I wake up with a nice smooth face, free of redness.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin feels smooth for days after use. I use it every third night instead of nightly because of the cost. It is $$$ for such a tiny bottle but at least a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Excellent product bottle was full. It is a great product for faces. Completely satisfied with this serum. This serum is the only product that I use at night.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I use a drop of this on my hand to alleviate eczema.</li>
            <li> This is another favorite skin care product of mine ( along with the Bare Minerals Skincare Glow Pads) and together when I used the serum and this I can honestly say my Skin never looked better!!! I have been out of both products for a while now ( since I ordered these last year) and am just doing all reviews on amazon today. And I can tell that now that I have run out of this and the other Glow Pads that my skin is NOT as nice. I am breaking out again ( which never happened when I was using serum and Glow pads) and just in general it does not look as good. Mind you I always had bad skin and always had to wear makeup to cover scars and stuff. And when I used this with glow pads my skin felt and looked flawless and other people noticed it too which was huge. And I did not feel the need to put any foundation on when I was using this....I have to order some more asap. Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> This serum felt so good going on. I could feel my skin soak it up right away. In the morning my skin looked tighter and smoother. This serum is worth every penny and was much cheaper than a high end product I had been using.</li>
            <li> I am giving this a 2 star instead of 1 because it works in the sense where its light weight and moisturzing however I realized after 3 months of using this product that it was causing me to break out. at first I thought it was a miracle lotion it felt like nothing that I had ever used. I have always had sensitive skin and have to be very cautious with what I use as I am a 30 and still will break out if I use the wrong product. after months of break outs and trying to figure out why my cheeks were getting the biggest zits ever I finally stopped using this product and within one week my face cleared up I really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is not for people who have problematic skin. I do not recommend trying this product if you are prone to break out or have oily skin or adult acne.</li>
            <li> Just started using it will review more in a month or 2. Love the way it goes on and is not runny.</li>
            <li> this made the skin on my nose peel. It was a gift so I did not know how to return it.</li>
            <li> If you want to wake up and look 5 years younger after the first use... GET THIS!!! My face is smooth, glowing, refreshed. Not greasy, no residue, soaks right in. I recommend this for anyone that wants a face pick me up.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product as a promo, so didn&#x27;t try it right away.  My skin was suffering from some dryness so I gave it a try one night.  I was amazed by the results, especially since I&#x27;m over 50.  My skin felt and looked much younger, softer and simply....better!  I was I&#x27;ve used all types of products from low end to quite expensive.  This product is a great value for the price.  I plan to purchase more!</li>
            <li> I normally cake myself at night with thick creams for my extremely dry and flaky skin.  I started using this about 2 weeks ago, every night before bed, and have seen excellent results as far as how supple and moisturized my skin feels.  I don&#x27;t even put on anymore HEAVY creams on my face at night or in the day, I use spf 20 bare minerals moisturizer in the day (for normal to dry)... Normal! I&#x27;ve been cured! The serum itself is not oily at all and absorbs very quickly and my skin feels much softer, not rough or even itchy like before, yay!</li>
            <li> Great service.......great product..........everything I thought it would be!  Bare Minerals is non toxic and you can actually feeling it working and healing............</li>
            <li> Most important, my wife likes it!  It fits well and has a place for driver&#x27;s license and credit cards.  Seem very durable.</li>
            <li> This is the magic wrinkle eraser.  I bought this for around my eyes.  And it works wonderfully!!  It is quite pricey, but you use so little that it is well worth the money.  I have found if you use this every night it works best.  Really GREAT product!</li>
            <li> Recently, my more expensive serum stopped working as well. Based on the superlative reviews, I decided to purchase this product and it definitely does not disappoint. It is reversing the nasolabial wrinkles as well as my superficial forehead wrinkles. It also does a superb job of evening out skin tone, something that myriad other products fail to do for my freckled, pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After realizing that the Amazon vendor was going to charge $14.97 in shipping costs for 3 oz of this product, I looked elsewhere and found it cheaper on Overstock.com with a 10% off coupon from retailmenot. The total cost per unit was $39.59.</li>
            <li> I dont care for this product at all, it makes me break out and I see no noticeable improvements. I&#x27;ll stick with my When Hope Is Not Enough serum.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased for my face!! As stated in the posted description; I did notice a drastic change in hydration within the first 24 hours. That hydration has since lasted and I&#x27;ve finally found the one thing that can help me to regulate my combination skin. It&#x27;s such&lt;br /&gt;a great thing and immediately look refreshed and this product does it for me. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even start to describe how great this product is. I have ridiculously dry and sensitive skin, I have wasted so much money on products that irritate or dry out my skin. I have mild acne as well and this product is great for it. I put on a tiny dab every other night before bed and I wake up with my skin clearer, more supple, moisturized, and with any acne reduced. It is a high price for a tiny bottle, however it is SO worth it. I made the mistake of using too much every night and using up the bottle very fast, however now I just put a TINY dot on each cheek and rub it all over my face. It is truly a miracle product.</li>
            <li> Really liked this. Kept my face soft and smooth without making me break out. Eventually switched to Khiels Midnight Recovery though. I like the dropped better.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product!  Love it! Noticed a difference overnight!</li>
            <li> had gotten a sample... seemed very nice.. when I ordered the product and received it... serum was thin and watery.. will not be ordering this product again...</li>
            <li> I am now at the age where I know when anti-aging products are doing their job, and this one does it! I have e.  xtremely oil skin, even at 45, and this soaks in without feeling greasy.  I wait about 10 min before I put my moisturizer on ( Bare Minerals for combination skin) and my skin is baby soft in the morning.  Different skin will act differently, but it works for me!</li>
            <li> I have used an entire bottle of this serum. I add one pearl sized drop to a pump of oil free moisturizer (generic brand from a local drugstore) and I use it just at night after washing my face. I had a little sun spot (the size of a pencil eraser) under my left eye that has lightened, ALMOOOOST disappeared. I can&#x27;t attribute it to anything else, this is the only thing that has changed in my skin care regimen. I will be purchasing another bottle.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this product with another order. I then ordered it for myself. Many times I order a product &amp; wonder if it really does anything, but in the case I actually see a difference in my face in the morning. Granted it&#x27;s not a face lift or even botox, but I really see some tightening!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb.  I had a sample and couldnt beleive how good my makeup looked the next day.  I havent had anything that worked this good in a very long time.  Love it.  Your skin glows the day after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every nighttime serum there with no noticeable results. This is the first product where I actually notice a difference every morning that I wake up!</li>
            <li> I got the product and the box looked like it had been repeatedly opened. There was no hygienic seal of any kind. Also the product did not appear as i remembered it nor did it appear to smell correct. If i could have guessed id say that the serum was diluted with something like glycerine. I could be wrong but it made me suspicious enough that i am returning the product. I loved this stuff when i had it before, it had a nice consistency and fragrance that was lacking in whatever it was that they shipped me.</li>
            <li> Love this! Would always have on hand! Highly likely to odkdemrjrkkpz</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I use it in addition to my daily moisturizer at night.  When I wake up in the morning my skin is glowing and the fine lines are smoothed out.</li>
            <li> Does help to renew your skin but I think it is a bit overpriced. However most cosmetics are overpriced and this is in line with comparable products.</li>
            <li> I have tried the majority of these renewal night serum products with the same result.  They felt like they were burning my skin (I have a slight case of roscea).  So I had given up on them all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My salon was selling the sampler kit that included this product, the facial soap, and the moisturizer.  I figured I would give it one more try.  I put the serum on my skin and it was absorbed immediately.  I had no burning sensation at all. After a few nights of following the regime, I noticed this morning that my skin was smoother, brighter, and not dry.  This product works great!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make up counters at those department stores sell similar products that range from $75 to $150 per small bottle.  This product is reasonably priced for the size.  Looking forward to purchasing a larger bottle next time.</li>
