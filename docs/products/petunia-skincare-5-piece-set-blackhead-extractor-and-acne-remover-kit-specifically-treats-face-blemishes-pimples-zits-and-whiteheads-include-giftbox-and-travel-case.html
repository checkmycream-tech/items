            <li>They work pretty well and keep my face clean, but the strips are pricey.</li>
            <li>clean my tools with soap and then pour some hot boiling water on them to sanitize them.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most complete acne removing kit as well as one of the more safer acne kits I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The comedones extractors have a really great quality, they are made from surgical stainless steel which means it is very durable would last a life time.</li>
            <li>I got this complimentary product for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>I rarely get pimples</li>
            <li>I was able to remove lots of black heads from my niece&#x27;s ears and nose and very easily too.  </li>
            <li>This surgical-quality kit contains 5 unique stainless steel tools to help you get rid of pimples, zits, blackheads, whiteheads and acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t having much success, or you&#x27;ve kind of loosened the plug by pulling the tool, I place the offending defect in the middle of the tool opening and apply pressure - gently at first, but increasing in strength.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t having much success, or you&#x27;ve kind of loosened the plug by pulling the tool, I place the offending defect in the middle of the tool opening and apply pressure - gently at first, but increasing in strength.</li>
            <li>This accomplishes the latter very well and the first fairly well.</li>
            <li>When you put the end on the blackhead and push on one side, the blackhead pops right out.</li>
            <li>Petunia Skincare got the right product for those who are in need of face tools like this blackhead extractor. </li>
            <li>This is what I have learned, but it may not be right.</li>
            <li>The extractors are very easy to clean by running under hot water and allowing to air dry.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was a smaller loop hole available for those really small blackheads on top of the nose, but other than that these are great and will order more for my brothers.</li>
            <li>There are many different sizes to accommodate whatever need you have.  </li>
            <li>The tools are pretty sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>I also soak them in hot soapy water when I was my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience using blackhead removal tools.</li>
            <li>Item arrived exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The item was exactly as described, and I used the tools to extract blackheads out of my boyfriend&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li>I started using one for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>When I first received my box I opened up the package to find the blackhead and acne remover kit.</li>
            <li>I received this for free to try out and so far it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I love this tool comes in different sizes.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps to remove the blackheads and is a very useful tool!</li>
            <li>- I buy absolutely everything possible on Amazon, and the only reason I make so many trips to the beauty supply store is to get more of these tools.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this tool and my 16 year old daughter who is such an acne prone right now enjoyed using it!</li>
            <li>No monitory compensation was received and I was not required to write a positive review.</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>It can also be especially helpful to apply a very warm, wet (damp) compress.</li>
            <li>Shipped really fast- exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>and i tell you i have never seen my nose so clean, soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in a whitehead/blackhead/pimple removal tool like this, then I highly recommend that you google and youtube it first.  </li>
            <li>After following instruction on how to use the tool and how to sterilize them I use them found them easy to use very sturdy like the ones at the doctors office.</li>
            <li>Your package will come in a nice little bag to hold all 5 pieces in the acne kit.</li>
            <li>so I will occasionally clean it in rubbing alcohol, however it is not necessary as hot water will do the trick as well.</li>
            <li>The tools are made of stainless steel and aren&#x27;t going to bend or break anytime soon.</li>
            <li>They work really well and remove the gunk without you having to push and tear up your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with these and believe they will save me some unnecessary scarring.</li>
            <li>I received my tools free for testing and reviewing purposes but my review is solely based on the actual experience I had using them.</li>
            <li>They are made of surgical stainless steel and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It does not hurt that much but for some reason, it makes me shed a tear.</li>
            <li>Then you want to place the tool over the blackhead and press gently on one side moving the tool across the blackhead.</li>
            <li>I am very OCD sometimes</li>
            <li>I use it very often whenever I get a whitehead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have even used the tool to gently scrape a stinger from a foot from an inconsiderate bee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have even used the tool to gently scrape a stinger from a foot from an inconsiderate bee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>omg i didn&#x27;t knew i had so much inside my nose skin</li>
            <li>, so much blackheads.</li>
            <li>Before I began I read the directions where it says to place the tool over the blackhead, press gently on one side, and move the tool across the affected area.</li>
            <li>I rarely have acne, whitehead or blackheads, but when they pop up I like to take action in removing them asap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have much facial impurities, however whenever one or two would appear especially on my face, this set really comes in handy coz</li>

            <li>The dual sides are really helpful.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>so you really get 10 because they are all usable.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this if you have been comparing different acne removing tools as this one in my opinion is one of the most complete and versatile ones I have seen in sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time but a different brand,im surprise with the product this is really nice.supposedly 5 pcs but only received 4 but still happy because everything u need is in it.</li>
            <li>First, you will have to steam or wet your face with warm water to open your pores.</li>
            <li>Basically, I try to keep the area as clean as possible throughout the process - you don&#x27;t want to cause additional issues around the area you are trying to</li>
            <li>Basically, I try to keep the area as clean as possible throughout the process - you don&#x27;t want to cause additional issues around the area you are trying to</li>
            <li>Each piece included in this kit is made of high quality stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are high quality tools made from surgical stainless steel and work well.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gross in a strangely cool way, isn&#x27;t it?)</li>
            <li>me.**(Gross - but it&#x27;s gross in a strangely cool way, isn&#x27;t it?)</li>
            <li>was lucky enough to get this kit as part of a promotion in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product at no cost.</li>
            <li>The tools have high quality.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a high quality set.  </li>
            <li>I cannot recommend these highly enough!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend these highly enough!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set as a gift or for yourself.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s kind of hard to see</li>
            <li>To get effective results, you would have to press hard on the nose and glide it outward.</li>
            <li>I love the smaller tools and they are all very high quality and not rough around the edges like some others in the same price point category.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I looked at quite a few and these are the highest (and most) rated.</li>
            <li>The only drawback it that it doesn&#x27;t come in a case like many others, just a plastic pouch, which will not hold up for too long.</li>
            <li>Soften and open your pores by massaging your face, taking steam or putting hot towel on the face.</li>
            <li>I just run it under hot water after I am done until I use it for next time.</li>
            <li>Used these blackhead remover tools first time ever, i can totally see the difference in my face.</li>
            <li>The instructions say, &amp;#34;The motion is very similar to spreading butter on bread&amp;#34; - and that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like.</li>
            <li>I previously bought a single tool from Sephora and I thought that would be good enough.  </li>
            <li>The plastic pouch was a little off-setting &amp; unprofessional looking, however – once I tried your tools, my opinion quickly changed!</li>
            <li>This Professional Blackhead and Acne Remover Kit is made of surgical stainless steel; which means it is built to last.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but based on the multitude of paid reviews here, this product seems like a scam.  </li>
            <li>If unsure, watch the professional Youtube videos or ask your dermatologist for instructions.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re done using the tools, wash them in hot soapy water dry them and store them in the slip cover included with the kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is incredible, the shipping was very fast, the tools are high quality, and the variety is insane.</li>
            <li>The price is incredible, the shipping was very fast, the tools are high quality, and the variety is insane.</li>
            <li>have a tool similar to these, but I really like the fact that the kit comes with different tips.</li>
            <li>i was eager to get this Professional Blackhead &amp; Acne Remover Kit since i would always have facial impurities that would appear on my face every now and then.</li>
            <li>The remover is SUPER sharp – so be careful.</li>
            <li>The packaging was a simple white plastic fold over sleeve but the tools themselves are professional looking.</li>
            <li>The five tools included in this set consist of the following  a double loop extractor, a single loop extractor,a fine loop extractor and lancets in different sizes for treating different sizes and shapes of pimples and black heads.</li>
            <li>Remove blackheads by centering the loop of the comedone extractor over the pimple you want to remove, and move the tool gently from side to side, applying slight pressure on it.</li>
            <li>Depending on the depth of the gunk, it is generally helpful to pull the tool in several different directions, being mindful NOT to scrape over the blackhead, etc.</li>
            <li>I have bad and deep pores so to clean and keep clean</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wish there was a smaller loop hole available for those really small blackheads on top of the nose, but other than that these are great and will order more for my brothers.</li>
            <li> There are many different sizes to accommodate whatever need you have.  </li>
            <li> The tools are pretty sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> I also soak them in hot soapy water when I was my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using blackhead removal tools.</li>
            <li> Item arrived exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described, and I used the tools to extract blackheads out of my boyfriend&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li> I started using one for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> When I first received my box I opened up the package to find the blackhead and acne remover kit.</li>
            <li> I received this for free to try out and so far it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I love this tool comes in different sizes.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps to remove the blackheads and is a very useful tool!</li>
            <li> - I buy absolutely everything possible on Amazon, and the only reason I make so many trips to the beauty supply store is to get more of these tools.</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this tool and my 16 year old daughter who is such an acne prone right now enjoyed using it!</li>
            <li> No monitory compensation was received and I was not required to write a positive review.</li>
            <li> No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li> and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> It can also be especially helpful to apply a very warm, wet (damp) compress.</li>
            <li> Shipped really fast- exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> and i tell you i have never seen my nose so clean, soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in a whitehead/blackhead/pimple removal tool like this, then I highly recommend that you google and youtube it first.  </li>
            <li> After following instruction on how to use the tool and how to sterilize them I use them found them easy to use very sturdy like the ones at the doctors office.</li>
            <li> Your package will come in a nice little bag to hold all 5 pieces in the acne kit.</li>
            <li> so I will occasionally clean it in rubbing alcohol, however it is not necessary as hot water will do the trick as well.</li>
            <li> The tools are made of stainless steel and aren&#x27;t going to bend or break anytime soon.</li>
            <li> They work really well and remove the gunk without you having to push and tear up your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with these and believe they will save me some unnecessary scarring.</li>
            <li> I received my tools free for testing and reviewing purposes but my review is solely based on the actual experience I had using them.</li>
            <li> They are made of surgical stainless steel and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It does not hurt that much but for some reason, it makes me shed a tear.</li>
            <li> Then you want to place the tool over the blackhead and press gently on one side moving the tool across the blackhead.</li>
            <li> I am very OCD sometimes</li>
            <li> I use it very often whenever I get a whitehead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have even used the tool to gently scrape a stinger from a foot from an inconsiderate bee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have even used the tool to gently scrape a stinger from a foot from an inconsiderate bee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> omg i didn&#x27;t knew i had so much inside my nose skin</li>
            <li> , so much blackheads.</li>
            <li> Before I began I read the directions where it says to place the tool over the blackhead, press gently on one side, and move the tool across the affected area.</li>
            <li> I rarely have acne, whitehead or blackheads, but when they pop up I like to take action in removing them asap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have much facial impurities, however whenever one or two would appear especially on my face, this set really comes in handy coz</li>
            <li> Instructions are provided on how to use these, but no explanation is really needed--just place device over your zit, exposed in the hole, and push.</li>
            <li> Instructions are provided on how to use these, but no explanation is really needed--just place device over your zit, exposed in the hole, and push.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cause pain really</li>
            <li> The dual sides are really helpful.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> so you really get 10 because they are all usable.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this if you have been comparing different acne removing tools as this one in my opinion is one of the most complete and versatile ones I have seen in sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time but a different brand,im surprise with the product this is really nice.supposedly 5 pcs but only received 4 but still happy because everything u need is in it.</li>
            <li> First, you will have to steam or wet your face with warm water to open your pores.</li>
            <li> Basically, I try to keep the area as clean as possible throughout the process - you don&#x27;t want to cause additional issues around the area you are trying to</li>
            <li> Basically, I try to keep the area as clean as possible throughout the process - you don&#x27;t want to cause additional issues around the area you are trying to</li>
            <li> Each piece included in this kit is made of high quality stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are high quality tools made from surgical stainless steel and work well.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s gross in a strangely cool way, isn&#x27;t it?)</li>
            <li> me.**(Gross - but it&#x27;s gross in a strangely cool way, isn&#x27;t it?)</li>
            <li> was lucky enough to get this kit as part of a promotion in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product at no cost.</li>
            <li> The tools have high quality.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a high quality set.  </li>
            <li> I cannot recommend these highly enough!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend these highly enough!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set as a gift or for yourself.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s kind of hard to see</li>
            <li> To get effective results, you would have to press hard on the nose and glide it outward.</li>
            <li> I love the smaller tools and they are all very high quality and not rough around the edges like some others in the same price point category.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I looked at quite a few and these are the highest (and most) rated.</li>
            <li> The only drawback it that it doesn&#x27;t come in a case like many others, just a plastic pouch, which will not hold up for too long.</li>
            <li> Soften and open your pores by massaging your face, taking steam or putting hot towel on the face.</li>
            <li> I just run it under hot water after I am done until I use it for next time.</li>
            <li> Used these blackhead remover tools first time ever, i can totally see the difference in my face.</li>
            <li> The instructions say, &amp;#34;The motion is very similar to spreading butter on bread&amp;#34; - and that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like.</li>
            <li> I previously bought a single tool from Sephora and I thought that would be good enough.  </li>
            <li> The plastic pouch was a little off-setting &amp; unprofessional looking, however – once I tried your tools, my opinion quickly changed!</li>
            <li> This Professional Blackhead and Acne Remover Kit is made of surgical stainless steel; which means it is built to last.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but based on the multitude of paid reviews here, this product seems like a scam.  </li>
            <li> If unsure, watch the professional Youtube videos or ask your dermatologist for instructions.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re done using the tools, wash them in hot soapy water dry them and store them in the slip cover included with the kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is incredible, the shipping was very fast, the tools are high quality, and the variety is insane.</li>
            <li> The price is incredible, the shipping was very fast, the tools are high quality, and the variety is insane.</li>
            <li> have a tool similar to these, but I really like the fact that the kit comes with different tips.</li>
            <li> i was eager to get this Professional Blackhead &amp; Acne Remover Kit since i would always have facial impurities that would appear on my face every now and then.</li>
            <li> The remover is SUPER sharp – so be careful.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a simple white plastic fold over sleeve but the tools themselves are professional looking.</li>
            <li> The five tools included in this set consist of the following  a double loop extractor, a single loop extractor,a fine loop extractor and lancets in different sizes for treating different sizes and shapes of pimples and black heads.</li>
            <li> Remove blackheads by centering the loop of the comedone extractor over the pimple you want to remove, and move the tool gently from side to side, applying slight pressure on it.</li>
            <li> Depending on the depth of the gunk, it is generally helpful to pull the tool in several different directions, being mindful NOT to scrape over the blackhead, etc.</li>
            <li> I have bad and deep pores so to clean and keep clean</li>
            <li> I will admit that at first I was intimidated by the tools but as soon as I read the directions and ran the first swipe, or in their terms like spreading butter, I was shocked at the ease of how the black heads came right out!  </li>
            <li> We had tried other methods, but this was the only one that worked to clear them out.</li>
            <li> hard to reach black heads and pimples on the side of the nose are easily removed and extracted with these tools.  </li>
            <li> Pressing hard on the tool usually doesn&#x27;t produce better results - it just leaves you with a deeper (temporary) indentation in your skin.</li>
            <li> Or gotten downright giddy over witnessing the long, white, threadlike snake</li>
            <li> the flat loops for pimples.</li>
            <li> The different sizes and shapes of the business ends of the tools mean you can detonate many sized issues, from the very small to the obscenely honkin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Eating MSG and oily foods usually are the main cause of my zits.</li>
            <li> i was very curious to use these when i got them, so after cleansing my face and taking a hot steam so that my blackhead will be soften as i have read somewhere ,i uses the one with bigger and rectangular hole to my noses in a motion as if i am putting cheese on a bagel little bit pressure on it so that pops black head out,</li>
            <li> am not a professional.</li>
            <li> I hate it these tools are really good.</li>
            <li> There are multiple sized loops and one sharp end for lancing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think it was a single day</li>
            <li> (Yeah - that&#x27;s why I&#x27;d get so annoyed when they would disappear almost as fast as I would replace them!</li>
            <li> I use giving this product to review just paid shipping hands down will be buying a second pair for my face.  </li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t really leave any marks (unless you push really hard !)</li>
            <li> (the cup style with the little hole in the middle), then thought I&#x27;d hit the jackpot when I found the style that&#x27;s like a looped wire at each end.</li>
            <li> One of my sons has had a definite problem with acne and blackheads - soaps, Biore strips, and even prescription treatments weren&#x27;t enough to clear his skin - he constantly seemed to have these painful volcanoes that would erupt on his face and back.</li>
            <li> Then you dont have to press harder.</li>
            <li> They are heavier then expected.</li>
            <li> kit comes with a few comedones of various sizes.</li>
            <li> That should really never be the case and never happened to me.</li>
            <li> Place the loop over the blackhead so the blackhead in the center of the loop.</li>
            <li> Then, while still applying pressure, slowly drag the loop over the blackhead.</li>
            <li> It really works well especially on hard flat area of face such as forehead.</li>
            <li> Usually you can find one of these in your local drug stores, just ONE though.</li>
            <li> There is no need to look for other products just to ease your burden towards your blackheads.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s even one with a sharp needle-end.</li>
            <li> Boil in the water and few minutes, let them dry and them use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Each piece is specifically designed to treat different size and hard to reach blackheads, whiteheads and acne.</li>
            <li> It took him a few tries,  but</li>
            <li> I have white heads and black head that are hard to get out</li>
            <li> just place over,  press and pull down.  </li>
            <li> After use I like to rub them down with a cotton ball that I soaked with rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pulling the tool across the skin, but not over the blackhead or pimple or whatever, usually works the ick loose.</li>
            <li> Half the time</li>
            <li> This Black head and acne removing kit is just what I needed to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> As sad as it is, I actually took a picture of the various tools and texted it to all three of my kids when I found these.</li>
            <li> I used to Squeeze my skin with nail to remove Black head</li>
            <li> Black heads/pimples/buildup will come out, and then you scrape it up, taking the impurity with the head of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Moving the rounded edge of the tool a little closer to the spot can also help to express any remaining nastiness.</li>
            <li> Moving the rounded edge of the tool a little closer to the spot can also help to express any remaining nastiness.</li>
            <li> Some looked a little deeper</li>
            <li> It looked like silly string was coming out of the pores, and the doctor claimed the patient&#x27;s blackheads were 12 years old!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not brave enough to go look!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have to go over a spot a few times</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few Youtube videos out there, but if you&#x27;re squeamish, you may be grossed</li>
            <li> I usually get a small spray bottle to put this in since I spray down all my &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was shocked how fast it shipped</li>
            <li> I have been obsessed with these tools ever since I discovered them in a beauty supply store about ten years ago.</li>
            <li> My sons ask for help with the tool as often as, if not more often than my daughter.  </li>
            <li> (I usually start with the oblong &amp;#34;wire&amp;#34; tools,</li>
            <li> It was nasty but also slightly satisfying to watch.</li>
            <li> Well, I was skeptical but these actually work!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean a few blemishes cleared up -</li>
            <li> And i use my fingers before or cotton buds to extract them and it is just so painful to squeeze them out so hard and its very unhygeinic.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I removed pimples but I hated the scars that developed after popping them.</li>
            <li> Then, slowly use the small side hoop and press on the nose.</li>
            <li> While these tools aren&#x27;t painful to use, they do sometimes leave a circular indentation if I press down too hard on my skin, especially my nose.</li>
            <li> It would be hard for me to explain how to use this in words.  </li>
            <li> they had to be pushing incredibly hard.</li>
            <li> (I was afraid to actually Watch a video,</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about him using his dirty hands,  not only damaging his skin,  but also spreading the bacteria.  </li>
            <li> lately I need to order for my family</li>
            <li> I mean the tool seemed to perform magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean like squirting then gushing pus, and followed by bleeding.</li>
            <li> I hate having pimples black head and white heads.</li>
            <li> I have a serious issue with whiteheads.</li>
            <li> The video is pretty gruesome to watch.</li>
            <li> I read the ebook, followed the instructions and had poor results.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just irritating whenever i get some pimples/ blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li> I have a weird guilty pleasure in extracting blackheads and pimples.  </li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t derive a deep satisfaction from knowing you have brought forth that nasty mound of gunk?</li>
            <li> but you are pressing something metal into your skin so it could be uncomfortable for some people.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for those people who like me are tired of pinching placed between your two fingers close up to the mirror!</li>
            <li> I have a son who has oily skin and gets blackheads like crazy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sick fascination everyone seems to share.</li>
            <li> and I hate to see them spoiling my beauty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worthless tools.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re persistent and at their worst, cringe-worthy---</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are made to last. The tools are made of stainless steel and aren&#x27;t going to bend or break anytime soon. I had never used extracting tools but it was quick reading on the web (I was afraid to actually Watch a video, gross out level Max) and I figured it out easily. They work really well and remove the gunk without you having to push and tear up your face. There are multiple sized loops and one sharp end for lancing. The packaging was a simple white plastic fold over sleeve but the tools themselves are professional looking. All in all I&#x27;m happy with these and believe they will save me some unnecessary scarring.I hope you found this information helpful. I received my tools free for testing and reviewing purposes but my review is solely based on the actual experience I had using them.</li>
            <li> I have a serious issue with whiteheads. Since I got such a great deal on this product, I can&#x27;t wait to try it out!! Got it for free</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get one of these kits for quite sometime, and I was thrilled to provide a review for this product when given a discount. Your package will come in a nice little bag to hold all 5 pieces in the acne kit. As I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use the instruments, the instructions provided helped so much with what to do. Have a girls&#x27; night and get your friends to give one another facials. Blackheads are easily removed! The one piece of advice I must reiterate is to sanitize the instruments and blemish to avoid infection. Great stainless steel product.</li>
            <li> Awesome!This is really great product premium blackhead &amp; Acne Remover easy to use and remove my blackheads on my skin.I never been use this but i was got this item i really excite to use especially on my nose lot of blackheads easy to remove really incredible and awesome product and good quality.Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I got this free item for testing and review purposes.So much love it!</li>
            <li> I have a son who has oily skin and gets blackheads like crazy.  He saw these and was so excited.  They are made of surgical stainless steel and very sturdy.  There are many different sizes to accommodate whatever need you have.  They are also really easy to get the hang of...just place over,  press and pull down.  It took him a few tries,  but once he figured it out,  they worked like a charm and I don&#x27;t have to worry about him using his dirty hands,  not only damaging his skin,  but also spreading the bacteria.  I am very happy with these.&lt;br /&gt;I received these for free for the purpose of testing and review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I used this as soon as I got it and it works well. I wish there was a smaller loop hole available for those really small blackheads on top of the nose, but other than that these are great and will order more for my brothers.</li>
            <li> This is a great acne and blackhead remover kit. It comes with 5 different tools in the set. I have many blackheads on my face and I hate to see them spoiling my beauty.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend sanitizing the tools before and after the use. Boil in the water and few minutes, let them dry and them use.&lt;br /&gt;This set of tools is great if you know how to use it. I recommend you watch youtube video(s) before doing anything to your face. I use comedone extractors to remove the blackheads. Soften and open your pores by massaging your face, taking steam or putting hot towel on the face. Then you dont have to press harder. Remove blackheads by centering the loop of the comedone extractor over the pimple you want to remove, and move the tool gently from side to side, applying slight pressure on it. The blackhead entirety will be pulled out. That is how I remove the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great professional blackhead remover kit. The tools have high quality. The tools are pretty sturdy and durable. The comedone extractors have great grip. You can take this kit with you anywhere. It comes with a transparent case. This surgical-quality kit contains 5 unique stainless steel tools to help you get rid of pimples, zits, blackheads, whiteheads and acne.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with this professional blackhead remover kit from Petunia Skincare. I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to get this kit as part of a promotion in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I decided to write a truthful review in exchange of its free product. My goal is only to write review but as I utilize this I cannot help but to buy another product for my husband. It really works great on our blackheads. It can also tighten our pores without experiencing any soreness or irritation on my face. I can now consider this as our great tool for great extraction of our blackheads.</li>
            <li> I got this free item for testing and review purposes. It&#x27;s everything I needed to remove those unwanted blackheads and whiteheads. I&#x27;ve always wanted one of these tools and try them myself. They work really great extracting the blackheads and whiteheads especially for home use. I recommend using these tools after shower as your skin is softer at that time. Be prepare to shed a tear or two when you&#x27;re extracting the blackheads and whiteheads. It does not hurt that much but for some reason, it makes me shed a tear. It might just be me. But I highly recommend this tool and my 16 year old daughter who is such an acne prone right now enjoyed using it!</li>
            <li> I love this tool set.  This set comes with 5 different tools.  Each tool works great depending on the type of blemish you have.  I have  been plagued with blackhead ever since I was a teenager. This tool set does a perfect job of getting rid of the few blackheads I still get.  This tool set comes with a lifetime guarantee.  So I never have to worry about them breaking.  This is a high quality set.  I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> This review is for the five piece Petunia skincare beauty tool premium blackhead and acne removal kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every piece included in this kit, is designed to remove unsightly blackheads and treat acne. Each piece is specifically designed to treat different size and hard to reach blackheads, whiteheads and acne. Each piece included in this kit is made of high quality stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easiest way to use each of these tools, is to begin by thoroughly cleaning your skin. Once you have done that you then select the size tool you will need. Then you want to place the tool over the blackhead and press gently on one side moving the tool across the blackhead. This will shave the top off the blackhead. Once you have removed the blackhead you need to thoroughly clean your skin again. This keeps you from getting any additional infected pores. Once you&#x27;re done using the tools, wash them in hot soapy water dry them and store them in the slip cover included with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free to evaluate, test and review.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most complete acne removing kit as well as one of the more safer acne kits I have ever used. Usually you can find one of these in your local drug stores, just ONE though. Half the time its too tiny or too big to extract the pimple or acne your trying to get rid of. What I like about this is that there are five different sizes. Not to mention it is easy to clean, making it very hygienic. I just run it under hot water after I am done until I use it for next time. I am very OCD sometimes so I will occasionally clean it in rubbing alcohol, however it is not necessary as hot water will do the trick as well. I would highly recommend this if you have been comparing different acne removing tools as this one in my opinion is one of the most complete and versatile ones I have seen in sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is 100% my own and mine alone.

            <li> [[VIDEOID:2104e1c59069ddaf77a173547f345d12]]This is my new favorite Blackhead Remover Kit!  I&#x27;m really in love with this set. There is one reason, there is one tool included in this set that is similar to a needle. (I know I&#x27;m not the only that has sorted through their sewing kit to get a needle to \\&quot;release\\&quot; a white head.) This specific tool is simply amazing! I use it very often whenever I get a whitehead. I use the tool to pop the surface layer of skin to release the built up dirt.  Please see my Video Review for additional thoughts/opinons.  I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have a weird guilty pleasure in extracting blackheads and pimples.  This Black head and acne removing kit is just what I needed to get the job done.  hard to reach black heads and pimples on the side of the nose are easily removed and extracted with these tools.  Simply press one of the ends against the problem area and the pus, oil, and dirt pops up!  I used this on my nose and voila!  results.  Cleared skin.  fast and easy.  The extractors are very easy to clean by running under hot water and allowing to air dry.  These are high quality tools made from surgical stainless steel and work well.  I highly recommend as a great quality and value.  While I was given these for free, the opinions and experiences expressed are all my own.</li>
            <li> I have been obsessed with these tools ever since I discovered them in a beauty supply store about ten years ago. All three of my kids have grown up with me picking at their skin with these - they actually call it &amp;#34;tool time&amp;#34;. lol If they have a blemish, blackhead, whitehead, etc, they ask if they can have &amp;#34;tool time&amp;#34; with me. My sons ask for help with the tool as often as, if not more often than my daughter.  One of my sons has had a definite problem with acne and blackheads - soaps, Biore strips, and even prescription treatments weren&#x27;t enough to clear his skin - he constantly seemed to have these painful volcanoes that would erupt on his face and back. He and I would spend &amp;#34;tool time&amp;#34; together every weekend...and in about 6 weeks, his skin was remarkably clearer. I don&#x27;t mean a few blemishes cleared up - I mean the tool seemed to perform magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only knew of one tool style for a couple of years (the cup style with the little hole in the middle), then thought I&#x27;d hit the jackpot when I found the style that&#x27;s like a looped wire at each end. I have bought many, MANY of these two styles over the years, as they always disappear. Always. And no one ever seems to know where they go. Hmmmm. I had finally decided to see if Amazon carries these - I buy absolutely everything possible on Amazon, and the only reason I make so many trips to the beauty supply store is to get more of these tools. I was totally stoked to find the tool here - but I WAS OVER THE MOON TO FIND THIS ASSORTMENT! As sad as it is, I actually took a picture of the various tools and texted it to all three of my kids when I found these. That&#x27;s how excited I was to find these. And the price?! Are you kidding me?? I&#x27;ve been spending $10-14.50 for EACH tool all these years. (Yeah - that&#x27;s why I&#x27;d get so annoyed when they would disappear almost as fast as I would replace them! I&#x27;m sure I would probably fall over if I looked under my daughter&#x27;s bed and in her closet - there are probably tens of them in/under there...but I&#x27;m not brave enough to go look!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the shipping on these was super fast - and like I said, the variety is INCREDIBLE. We all now have our favorites. All of the tools are easy to clean - I use an alcohol soaked cotton ball and/or cotton bud to rub the tool. I also soak them in hot soapy water when I was my makeup brushes. The different sizes and shapes of the business ends of the tools mean you can detonate many sized issues, from the very small to the obscenely honkin&#x27;. And let&#x27;s just be honest here - who doesn&#x27;t like to get that crud out of there? Who doesn&#x27;t derive a deep satisfaction from knowing you have brought forth that nasty mound of gunk? Or gotten downright giddy over witnessing the long, white, threadlike snake quickly pullulate from the depths of your dermis?? If you deny it, you&#x27;re lying. It&#x27;s a sick fascination everyone seems to share. I&#x27;m not saying you have to admit it publicly, but you know I&#x27;m telling the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If possible, start by washing your face (or the area you are going to work on). I wash the area with warm water and &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; before wiping with alcohol. It can also be especially helpful to apply a very warm, wet (damp) compress. The best way to use the tools is to begin with a gentle touch. Let the tool do the work. Pressing hard on the tool usually doesn&#x27;t produce better results - it just leaves you with a deeper (temporary) indentation in your skin. I find it works best to place the affliction within the parameter of the tool. (I usually start with the oblong &amp;#34;wire&amp;#34; tools, since that is what I am most familiar with.) Pulling the tool across the skin, but not over the blackhead or pimple or whatever, usually works the ick loose. Depending on the depth of the gunk, it is generally helpful to pull the tool in several different directions, being mindful NOT to scrape over the blackhead, etc. A snake-like plug should begin to grow as you pull the tool around it.(Gross - but it&#x27;s gross in a strangely cool way, isn&#x27;t it?) If you aren&#x27;t having much success, or you&#x27;ve kind of loosened the plug by pulling the tool, I place the offending defect in the middle of the tool opening and apply pressure - gently at first, but increasing in strength. To make sure you have cleaned out the spot as well as you can, you can move the tool handle around like the hands of a clock, without moving the position of the tool around the follicle. Moving the rounded edge of the tool a little closer to the spot can also help to express any remaining nastiness. Removing the tool and wiping the area with an astringent, witch hazel, alcohol, etc, is good practice as well. Basically, I try to keep the area as clean as possible throughout the process - you don&#x27;t want to cause additional issues around the area you are trying to fix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have even used the tool to gently scrape a stinger from a foot from an inconsiderate bee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: I LOVE THESE TOOLS. They are as important in my beauty routine as soap, water, tweezers, and toothpaste. These are fantastically awesome at clearing skin nasties. The price is incredible, the shipping was very fast, the tools are high quality, and the variety is insane. I cannot recommend these highly enough!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**These are just the steps I take - I am not recommending you follow my explanation, nor am I suggesting this is the best way to handle somewhat superficial skin lumps, bumps, volcanoes, etc. I&#x27;m only explaining what works for me.**(Gross - but it&#x27;s gross in a strangely cool way, isn&#x27;t it?)

            <li> Quality produced instruments at a fair price!!</li>
            <li> Worthless tools.  I read the ebook, followed the instructions and had poor results.  I tried applying more pressure and the metal scraped my skin, leaving an embarrassing abrasion on my face that has scabbed over.  Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but based on the multitude of paid reviews here, this product seems like a scam.  Gloved fingers work much better, which says a lot about this product.</li>
            <li> I love using these. I have used it on myself and even made my husband do his blackheads too. I is easy and not scaring like I would if I just used my hands.They are very well made and strong. I would recommend this to anyone. I RECEIVED THIS  PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Great product good quality a must have I recommend</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use these and man did they not disappoint they work great have to go over a spot a few times but they don&#x27;t really leave any marks (unless you push really hard !)&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> Used these blackhead remover tools first time ever, i can totally see the difference in my face. i was very curious to use these when i got them, so after cleansing my face and taking a hot steam so that my blackhead will be soften as i have read somewhere ,i uses the one with bigger and rectangular hole to my noses in a motion as if i am putting cheese on a bagel little bit pressure on it so that pops black head out, omg i didn&#x27;t knew i had so much inside my nose skin that looked gross, so much blackheads. then i followed it up with toner and a moisturizer and i tell you i have never seen my nose so clean, soft and gentle. love this set. got it for review purposes but i am hooked up on it. gonna gift this to my sister also.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using blackhead removal tools. Before I began I read the directions where it says to place the tool over the blackhead, press gently on one side, and move the tool across the affected area. It didn&#x27;t seem to be working - I was going to go to their website to see if they have any videos. But I tried a bit more and got the hang of it. The instructions say, &amp;#34;The motion is very similar to spreading butter on bread&amp;#34; - and that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like. It comes with 5 tools and I quickly had a favorite. Also, it&#x27;s kind of hard to see so I wiped the tool on the end of a Q-tip as I went along. That way you can see what you&#x27;re removing with the contrast of the white cotton. I found it was easy to remove ones that were at the surface. Some looked a little deeper and I didn&#x27;t get them out. For those, I think I&#x27;ll use a mask to bring them closer to the surface and then they&#x27;ll be easier to get out using these tools. I was able to get a sample for evaluation and review purposes - would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very effective.  It would be hard for me to explain how to use this in words.  If you&#x27;re interested in a whitehead/blackhead/pimple removal tool like this, then I highly recommend that you google and youtube it first.  I like this tool because it has a different variety and size.  I previously bought a single tool from Sephora and I thought that would be good enough.  However, having a variety of tools like this, is a good option since you can&#x27;t really predict which one you&#x27;ll use until you try them all.  So all in all, a good investment and purchase for those who know how to use this and is interested in taking care of their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t forget to disinfect before AND after you use this.  Use isopropyl alcohol.  I usually get a small spray bottle to put this in since I spray down all my &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; tools...</li>
            <li> Item arrived exactly as described.  Would buy again and recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This product greatly works! It really works well especially on hard flat area of face such as forehead. When it comes to best, this is the right one for you and you can take this blackhead extractor from Petunia Skincare. There is no need to look for other products just to ease your burden towards your blackheads. Consider using this product and be excited on how it will make your face amazingly beautiful.</li>
            <li> This Professional Blackhead and Acne Remover Kit is made of surgical stainless steel; which means it is built to last. This kit contains 5 different double sided extractors all targeted on specifically removing different sized and hard-to-reach impurities such as blemishes, blackheads, whiteheads, and pimples. The kit also comes with a plastic pouch for easy storage. The extractors are easy to use and the textured handles provide an anti-slip grip, comfort and precision when extracting whiteheads, blackheads or blemishes. I rarely have acne, whitehead or blackheads, but when they pop up I like to take action in removing them asap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tool similar to these, but I really like the fact that the kit comes with different tips. I especially like the needle point tip. Makes it really easy to remove the stubborn ones. After use I like to rub them down with a cotton ball that I soaked with rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m happy with the Blackhead and Acne Remover Kit. I would definitely recommend and would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;**This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> The five tools included in this set consist of the following  a double loop extractor, a single loop extractor,a fine loop extractor and lancets in different sizes for treating different sizes and shapes of pimples and black heads. You  can definitely  tell that these are sturdy and well made. They are heavier then expected. The directions say that the motion  to use is similar  to spreading butter so that&#x27;s what  I did. My results were good in the sense of successful  extraction  but the next day I was scabbed  up where I did the extraction. Not to happy  about that...I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.</li>
            <li> i was eager to get this Professional Blackhead &amp; Acne Remover Kit since i would always have facial impurities that would appear on my face every now and then. The comedones extractors have a really great quality, they are made from surgical stainless steel which means it is very durable would last a life time. Each one is very easy to use and the handles are not slippery so it wouldn&#x27;t slide on your fingers while using it. I don&#x27;t really have much facial impurities, however whenever one or two would appear especially on my face, this set really comes in handy coz it&#x27;s just irritating whenever i get some pimples/ blemishes on my face. And i use my fingers before or cotton buds to extract them and it is just so painful to squeeze them out so hard and its very unhygeinic. It&#x27;s good to have this set at home when the need arises. Plus they also give you this ebook for instructions on how to use it and clean it which is very easy to follow. I like the fact that it comes with this comedone that pricks the pimples so you can extract them immediately, coz i was having problems extracting a pimple just beside my nose before and immediately used this to extract it and it worked perfectly well and I&#x27;m very much pleased with it. I got this complimentary product for testing and review purposes. All thoughts and opinions are of my own and were not swayed by anyone.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described, and I used the tools to extract blackheads out of my boyfriend&#x27;s nose. We had tried other methods, but this was the only one that worked to clear them out.</li>
            <li> I like Blackhead &amp; Acne Remover Kit. ~♡&lt;br /&gt;Before using these kit. I used to Squeeze my skin with nail to remove Black head and It gave me a scar.&lt;br /&gt;Now? Just push it and then you can see Blackhead easily.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, but why so many?  Two would have been fine.</li>
            <li> Great product! Exactly as described at a good price. Recieved product free to write review.</li>
            <li> Works well, wish the PDF was a YouTube video instead. And that it came with good soaps or recommendations of products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a pimple or two on my face since my teens. They&#x27;re persistent and at their worst, cringe-worthy---I mean like squirting then gushing pus, and followed by bleeding. Eating MSG and oily foods usually are the main cause of my zits. I think oily skin equals oily, clogged pores. I have been using Biore pore strips for over 10 years now. They work pretty well and keep my face clean, but the strips are pricey. I sometimes can&#x27;t help but squeeze out blackheads/pimples using my nails in between face washings and pore strips. I recently saw a video featuring a doctor using a &amp;#34;comedone&amp;#34; to extract a patient&#x27;s blackheads. The video is pretty gruesome to watch. It looked like silly string was coming out of the pores, and the doctor claimed the patient&#x27;s blackheads were 12 years old! It was nasty but also slightly satisfying to watch. After learning about comedones, I decided to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at quite a few and these are the highest (and most) rated. I started using one for the first time yesterday. My goal is to be able to squeeze out clogged pores without leaving scars and without pain. This accomplishes the latter very well and the first fairly well. While these tools aren&#x27;t painful to use, they do sometimes leave a circular indentation if I press down too hard on my skin, especially my nose. However, though I&#x27;m worried about a bit of permanent scarring, this hasn&#x27;t happened with the comedone. I can say for a fact it has happened before when I used to pinch pimples with my fingertips/nails. I&#x27;ve recently read that you&#x27;re actually not supposed to use fingers/nails as this causes scarring--instead, the comedone applies even pressure around the pore and doesn&#x27;t scar. Just keep in mind a good amount of pressure is needed to squeeze impurities out of your pores so this isn&#x27;t 100% pain free...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a few comedones of various sizes. There&#x27;s even one with a sharp needle-end. I have no idea what it&#x27;s for and frankly, am a bit scared--does it pop things? I can see myself using it on a balloon, but my face? Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools are sturdy, yet lightweight and fairly simple to use. I cleaned them off with a  cottonball dipped into rubbing alcohol. Instructions are provided on how to use these, but no explanation is really needed--just place device over your zit, exposed in the hole, and push. Black heads/pimples/buildup will come out, and then you scrape it up, taking the impurity with the head of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying cleaning my pores with these. Hope they help you as well.ankly, am a bit scared--does it pop things? I can see myself using it on a balloon, but my face?

            <li> These extractors are so easy to use. My girlfriend has a problem with blackheads on her face. I got her to let me &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; on her and these extractors worked wonders. When you put the end on the blackhead and push on one side, the blackhead pops right out. There is none of that mashing and making the face red and sore. She can use these on her own and doesn&#x27;t need me to do it (I like that part). I received these extractors free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Sturdy quality,  nice selection of tool heads and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Well, I was skeptical but these actually work!  I rarely get pimples so I have only used these once. I got them for my teenage daughter who is suffering from acne.  Instructions are lacking somewhat so I suggest watching some YouTube videos before using them (prepare to be grossed out).  It is best to steam your face or use after showering for your pores to open up (steaming works best). It will make your face a bit red so I recommend using at night. All the redness will be gone by the morning. They don&#x27;t cause pain really but you are pressing something metal into your skin so it could be uncomfortable for some people.  I was lucky enough to receive this product at no cost.</li>
            <li> When I first received my box I opened up the package to find the blackhead and acne remover kit. I will admit that at first I was intimidated by the tools but as soon as I read the directions and ran the first swipe, or in their terms like spreading butter, I was shocked at the ease of how the black heads came right out!  I would recommend this product for those people who like me are tired of pinching placed between your two fingers close up to the mirror!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time but a different brand,im surprise with the product this is really nice.supposedly 5 pcs but only received 4 but still happy because everything u need is in it.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these.  Was going to purchase another set and then came across these and purchased them on a whim.  Super glad I did.  I was able to remove lots of black heads from my niece&#x27;s ears and nose and very easily too.  I love the smaller tools and they are all very high quality and not rough around the edges like some others in the same price point category.  I highly recommend this set as a gift or for yourself.  The only drawback it that it doesn&#x27;t come in a case like many others, just a plastic pouch, which will not hold up for too long.</li>
            <li> Tools Are Very Nice To Grip With Raised Edges. Works Great On Skin And Evens Out The Pressure Nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Received This Item At A Discounted Price For My Honest Unbiased Review.</li>
            <li> Shipped really fast- exactly as pictured. Works beautifully. The dual sides are really helpful. I read a lot of reviews saying these tools made them bleed. That should really never be the case and never happened to me. Definitely disregard those- they had to be pushing incredibly hard. This product is good when used the right way. Users must learn how to use it because the product from Petunia Skincare that I got for free works incredibly well. </li>
            <li> I have a lot of blackheads on my nose, and I felt that it was time to change. First, you will have to steam or wet your face with warm water to open your pores. Then, slowly use the small side hoop and press on the nose. To get effective results, you would have to press hard on the nose and glide it outward. I&#x27;ve used it for three days already and I see good results. Petunia Skincare got the right product for those who are in need of face tools like this blackhead extractor. </li>
            <li> Nice set of blackhead removing items.  Got a great discount on the item and I&#x27;m,very pleased.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I received this for free to try out and so far it works pretty well. It definitely helps to remove the blackheads and is a very useful tool!</li>
            <li> I recieved this as a promotion and this is my honest opinion. I love this tool comes in different sizes. I have white heads and black head that are hard to get out but with this tool its very easy and No pain. It also doesnt leave your skin red or swollen. Just like putting butter on a bread but your are not putting butter haha actually helping your pores get cleared and no breakouts for later in the future. Ive been using these tools often lately I need to order for my family they want to use mine.</li>
            <li> Since I was a teenager, I&#x27;ve been using very similar tools like this Petunia Skincare Blackhead and Acne Remover Kit to get rid my blackheads and whiteheads. Occasionally, I removed pimples but I hated the scars that developed after popping them. It&#x27;s not the most pleasant experience  because this task of removing blackhead really hurts. Sometimes, I get teary-eyed with pain but that&#x27;s the price you pay in the name of beauty. This product has usage instructions so please make sure you read them. The tools have high quality and the design lets you get a better hold of them while using them. I hope the photos I attached are helpful in your decision to buy this kit. I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.  PS: Pls. pardon the pictures of my big nose!</li>
            <li> This is a great, quality set. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Prior to ordering this set, I was using a generic tool I bought from the local drugstore. It was functional but did not do as great of a job as this set. The variety of tools available met all my needs.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Worked the first time...like a charm!</li>
            <li> Works great once you learn how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few Youtube videos out there, but if you&#x27;re squeamish, you may be grossed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick, unofficial instructions:&lt;br /&gt;Sterilize everything before and after each use, the tools and your skins.&lt;br /&gt;Use the wire loop for blackheads. Place the loop over the blackhead so the blackhead in the center of the loop. Apply ample pressure downward into the skin. Then, while still applying pressure, slowly drag the loop over the blackhead. You may need to repeat this a couple times and apply more pressure. It may hurt a little.&lt;br /&gt;Use the flat loops for pimples. Same instructions as blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you get all the liquids out of there until you start bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional. This is what I have learned, but it may not be right. These tool were made so you don&#x27;t damage yourself, but just in case, I take no responsibility if you somehow damage yourself. If unsure, watch the professional Youtube videos or ask your dermatologist for instructions. I was able to recieve this product free of charge to give the company my review of this product!</li>
            <li> I loved hem came at the right my spouse had a boil that needed to be drained.

            <li> I have recieved one of these single tools before and to now try out the entire kit is awesome I have bad and deep pores so to clean and keep clean the pores is awesome I was shocked how fast it shipped and I recieved it.

            <li> I hate having pimples black head and white heads. I have pimples in my back on my face. I hate it these tools are really good. I have another for my face and got these for my back. My husband helps me get them out of my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that these tools have 2 sides so you really get 10 because they are all usable. If you don&#x27;t know how to use these tools google it or check YouTube so many information about how to use these tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean my tools with soap and then pour some hot boiling water on them to sanitize them. These tools are better than using your hands because you introduce bacteria making it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this tools you can easy remove the blemish without hurting your skin and getting so much inflammation. These are easy to use and easy to clean. They come with a nice plastic bag where I always store them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample ,review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The shipping was VERY quick! I received my kit in only 3 days! The plastic pouch was a little off-setting &amp; unprofessional looking, however – once I tried your tools, my opinion quickly changed! The remover is SUPER sharp – so be careful. And it works GREAT!</li>
