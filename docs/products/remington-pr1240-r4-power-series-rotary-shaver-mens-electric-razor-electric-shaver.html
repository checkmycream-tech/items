            <li>After a week for my skin to adjust i would have to say that this is the best shave I have ever gotten with an electric razor!  </li>

            <li>I was so impressed with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>The triple head design seems to be of the lift and cut style, so if you&#x27;re prone to ingrown hairs, this might not be the best shaver for you.</li>

            <li>This is a great shaver!</li>

            <li>Great lil electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is a great &#x27;entry level&#x27; electric razor.</li>
            <li>The lithium battery is great</li>
            <li>So happy it&#x27;s here.</li>
            <li>great for that starter razor.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>The razor is as described, gives and excellent shave, the price was excellent and even with free shipping</li>
            <li>This is a very nice razor.  </li>
            <li>An excellent product, for an outstanding price.</li>
            <li>Works really good makes a nice close shave!</li>
            <li>Very nice razor at a very respectable cost.</li>
            <li>It was so good</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m delighted to have bought it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>Im not a hairy guy, and Remmington makes good products.</li>
            <li>It has never given me a good close shave.</li>
            <li>This works as good as a norelco .</li>
            <li>However, for those who do, it&#x27;s good in that respect.  </li>
            <li>People do not realize it takes about a week of electric razor use to get good results.</li>
            <li>After a week of use the skin is smoother and you get a good shave from the electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It is noisy and does not give a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Good price , arrived on time and in tact .</li>
            <li>I guess I am spoiled by Norelco with a superior product.</li>
            <li>This provides a good shave for me.</li>
            <li>I have never had an electric that does as good of a job as a blade.  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>lightweight - gives a clean shave - very happy with it</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s also been impressed with the ability to run it under the faucet to clean out.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am a happy wife :-)</li>
            <li>Most reviews here are from experienced electric razor users.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll not hesitate to shop Amazon more often!  </li>
            <li>I was less happy with my Panasonic (women&#x27;s) razor and was very happy when I could replace it with a Remington, which I&#x27;d happily used for years until the rechargable battery gave out.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, there is no reason to buy this product, at whatever price.</li>
            <li>A cover for the business end of the shaver would be nice for packing in the suitcase&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I am pleased, good close shave.</li>
            <li>Works fine,thought it had some kind of indication of battery charge state,but does not.</li>
            <li>and fits in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li>Remington has always had decent, perfectly useable electric shavers, if not always built the sturdiest.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I happily looked at the great looking shaver in the new box.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is not attached to the cord after charging is a new and wonderful plus for my husband.</li>
            <li>It fits well in my hand, the razors heads flow smoothly across my face, and the unit holds a charge for a good length of time.</li>
            <li>A clean razor is a good razor.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been pretty happy with this one.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight</li>
            <li>This review is feedback from my husband: On the plus side, this shaver is very light and the battery lasts longer than many shavers.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised of a good product for more than a fair price.  </li>
            <li>Very good replacement for my old N---elco</li>
            <li>otherwise I am pleased</li>
            <li>Has been using it daily for a week now and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the razor.</li>
            <li>My guess is that it will break in and do better with use.  </li>
            <li>I am able to shave for one week without recharging the battery.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $20 for it.</li>
            <li>even tried the break-in period for 10 days like most razors recommend to train your beard.&lt;br /&gt;ther should be a minos rating so i could give a minos -10.</li>
            <li>so I wanted something with better battery life.  </li>
            <li>Spend a bit more and get the competitor brand.</li>
            <li>great shaver does the job it was made for very well</li>
            <li>I can say that the brand is very reliable, having happily used their products for years myself.  </li>
            <li>It felt more like a child&#x27;s toy.  </li>
            <li>This is just OK, I would have given this 2.5 stars if that was an option.</li>
            <li>While this does an OK job, it is nowhere close to the shave you get from using a blade cartridge with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>He used it to trim and refine his goatee and said, \\&quot;It does a better job than I thought it would, but I can&#x27;t see myself using this for the long-term.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They need to come up with a better package to put the razors in so they can tell if the razor was used before someone returned it.</li>
            <li>Shaving my husband&#x27;s face, this works okay, but for his mustache and goatee the trimmer does not edge well.</li>
            <li>If so, I would be able to recommend this shaver wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li>I have been told by all that they are pleased.</li>
            <li>The reason I like an electric shaver is to avoid shaving off the top of a raised mole on my face.  </li>
            <li>Lasts for more than 60 minutes of run</li>
            <li>I like it so much better than the NORELCO I used before ($150 item).</li>
            <li>If I go for more than a day without shaving...</li>
            <li>It does not have some of the bells and whistles of a top of the line model , but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>One of the better razors for under 50.00.Titanium blades and pivoting head make for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>It is the best razor he has had in his entire lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>my shaver arrived in excellent order and entirely met my expectations it shaves as goodas any electric shaver I have owned if not</li>
            <li>better rergards</li>
            <li>Not too many bells and whistles, but who needs all ofnthat when you just need to shave.</li>
            <li>OK for an electric.  </li>
            <li>got this for fathers day, and so far my dad has been loving it, the charge lasts as good two weeks and its very easy to shave with.</li>
            <li>but it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>first impression of this Remington razor weren&#x27;t so good.</li>
            <li>This one has the five minute quick charge and you can use it plugged in, two nice features.  </li>
            <li>He also liked how quickly it charged.</li>
            <li>The heads are easy to clean with warm water and soap if you like.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight, in fact I would say too light.</li>
            <li>And its trimmer blades fixed my sideburns just great too.  </li>
            <li>All in all - as far as shavers go - a great</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave and is easy to clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on my face and neck and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The pivot head seemed to fight me rather than flowing easily.</li>
            <li>It is a satisfactory shave, plenty of oomph to do the job and easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>It’s a great color – my favorite (Yes, I’m a visual person, so that matters.)</li>
            <li>If I let it grow all weekend, it is easy to shave off, but day-to-day shaving can be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as good as my old remington razor, but Ok for the price.</li>
            <li>The shaver head opened fine and rinsed easy.</li>
            <li>continues the tri-head tradition of a lot of razors used nowadays and makes for a pretty nice shave.</li>
            <li>GREAT shaver so far,  using for about two weeks now,  been using remington shavers for a few years,  best one yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a good basic razor and I will definitely use it for 3+ day growth, but still not my perfect razor, so the quest continues.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it is easy to clean - press a lever and the top pops up, making it easy to clean the razors</li>
            <li>I was delighted with the performance of my new razor.  </li>
            <li>WORKS FINE AND NO COMPLAINTS</li>
            <li>The razor itself works fine.</li>
            <li>Honestly this one cuts exactly the same as the one I had before, it cuts great except around the mustache area and some on the neck, it still cuts those areas but not well.</li>
            <li>It’s supper quite, a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I very much enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>and it is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>This Remington feels bulky and cheap in my hands.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic electric shavers, fantastic price</li>
            <li>Clean up is easy when all you have to do is rinse it under water .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rechargeable (the light shows when that&#x27;s needed)---and</li>
            <li>it glides smoothly</li>
            <li>I then ran it for an entire hour on the counter and that was a great sign of the amount of time I could get out of it.  </li>
            <li>While I am not against plastic, it just felt cheap for some reason as compared to another I have.  </li>
            <li>It did not move smoothly as it shifted around.  </li>
            <li>However, there is something that feels cheap and plasticky about the construction.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap product and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>my husband loves this, it is so light weight.</li>
            <li>my husband says it doesnt give him a smooth shave</li>
            <li>Cheap product compared to Norelco.</li>
            <li>It easily rinses clean under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and does the job.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I know products need to be made cheaply</li>
            <li>cheap.</li>
            <li>Fantastic electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It certainly does a good job when first out-of-the-box, and I would give it a five star review</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that this unit has a very cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li>I like these on the road or in the car as they are quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use</li>
            <li>one smooth swipe it clear cut a path across my face that would make any standard blade razor proud!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Comparing to a $120 razor, this does not yield as clean cut</li>
            <li>a super smooth shave</li>
            <li>So clean up is quicker and easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and charges quickly, and while not quite as comfortable as my Norelco, it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>The shaver charges up fine and holds a charge good enough to get about five days to a week worth of shaves before needing recharged.</li>
            <li>He is, however, comparing it to a very high end razor which he has used for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next day, with a good two days growth on my face</li>
            <li>I had to keep going over the same areas to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>He had the same feeling, that it just wasn&#x27;t as good as he was used to.</li>
            <li>This thing does not rotate quickly...barely cuts even on full charge.  </li>
            <li>Good low cost shaver!</li>
            <li>Quite good actually.</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave is not bad, but isn’t as close as a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>He likes his Panasonic better (but it is the top of their line) and while satisfied with the Remington, finds it just average.  </li>
            <li>CAME QUICK</li>
            <li>Quick close shave.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re able to get a shaver with independently floating heads you&#x27;re better off.</li>
            <li>Quick charge:</li>
            <li>Lithium Power Series R5 Rotary Shaver is built for comfort, speed, precision, and, most importantly, high performance.</li>
            <li>And when you&#x27;re finished, it washes clean right under the faucet.ight under the faucet.</li>
            <li>Deliver was within a few days, and the razor is beautiful and efficient.</li>
            <li>Got a refund (which was quick and easy, THANKS).  </li>
            <li>longer battery life ,much shorter charge time ,removable batteries,very easy to clean.all of these make it a winner.</li>
            <li>I is gentle and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfectly serviceable rotary shaver, and for ladies&#x27; shaving such as legs, it did a quick and serviceable job, certainly better than the ladies&#x27; electric razor I ordinarily use.</li>
            <li>But given the fact that shaving is fast and easy, that&#x27;s something we can overlook.</li>
            <li>Very well constructed and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it to replace my dying Norelco as it was a reasonable price point compared to others that do the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a straight-forward rotary shaver - inexpensive and lightweight, it&#x27;s a nice extra unit to toss in your carry-on for a quick touch-up before arrival at your destination.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The head unit is easy to clean with running water, but the individual cutter wheels are easily dropped if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Great little machine.</li>
            <li>Also the whole thing is made out of a cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my old Remington R845 which wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more</li>
            <li>I turned it on fully expecting it to fall to pieces under the overwhelming strength of my masculine chin</li>
            <li>Razor blades makes the skin of the face rough and prevents getting a good result from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>charge.&lt;br /&gt;-Washable Design - Keep your shaver fresh.</li>
            <li>Also positive is that the battery, once charged, lasts a long time, again good for travel.</li>
            <li>This razor does not get that good, close shave that we&#x27;ve seen with other electric razors.  </li>
            <li>I will buy another (when the price is right) to have when this one wears out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to manipulate much to get a neat and clean shave despite the two days of growth I had established to test it out.  </li>
            <li>For the average user this is a good model for the cost.</li>
            <li>Pay a little more and get a better quality shaver.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean, big deal.</li>
            <li>This shaver does a smooth job of shaving, though it&#x27;s more rough to hold than the higher-end models.</li>
            <li>My only comment on the razor is that it is all plastic which makes it very light</li>
            <li>The rotary shaver works quietly and produces very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The hair is very fine and they lay flat as they emerge.</li>
            <li>I thought my husband would be excited to get this new razor, but he wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to order the new REMINGTON PRODUCTS R5 LITHIUM POWER SERIES ROTARY SHAVER, for my husband.</li>
            <li>broke first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t shave quite as well as my first Remington rotary</li>
            <li>first charge of razor lasted dec 8 2014 to march 14 2015.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d give this unit a try because it was on sale for $30, the same price it would cost to replace the blades on my much better quality Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li>I waited on this review since the first one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
            <li>Our son&#x27;s first electric razor.</li>
            <li>Having recently replaced my Remington with a newer model of the same line, I am very happy, but it is a different razor and I can not argue with his differing experience.</li>
            <li>This is one razor that you cannot judge on first appearance.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was the cheaper feel of the case.</li>
            <li>Husband is pretty picky about his razors, but this one fills the bill..</li>
            <li>Ultimately, my Braun also shaves a bit closer than this Remington, though admittedly the Braun is much more expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charge holds for a long time, and it&#x27;s really easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It doesn’t irritate the skin and the cutters don’t get hot.  </li>
            <li>In these months it has held up pretty well.</li>
            <li>Its Precision Cut shaving heads with titanium-coated Twin Track blades smoothly cut long hair and stubble for an ultra close, comfortable shave every time.</li>
            <li>While it does have excellent battery life, all other aspects were a let down.  </li>
            <li>working fine, better with a few uses.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor because it has dual bladed shavers and other nice features.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the only small downisde is it does not give a very close shave , but however , Remignton shavers tend to be very durable , they tend to last 10 years or more without a blade change , unlike Norelco shavers , which are excellent for about 6 months , but then their blades lose their edge.</li>
            <li>This particular electric shaver seems to carry on the tradition of providing the user with a good shave, not a great shave, but one that is good enough.</li>
            <li>So, it seems like a good value for the price, but I&#x27;ll update later if necessary.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s better than the older version of the same model.</li>
            <li>so it takes up less room in the luggage which is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleanup is incredibly easy, as the head snaps up with a push of a latch button, and you simply run the tap water over the face and insides of the razor body.  </li>
            <li>The head had a built in wobble to supposedly make it easy to go around your chin and such.  </li>
            <li>My first concern with this shave was that it is very lightweight and has a very plastic feel to it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have independently floating heads which makes the shave much less effective and comfortable than a shaver that does.</li>
            <li>Second one charged up fine, used it for almost three weeks before recharging.  </li>
            <li>Use a little Shaver Saver in the spray can and it lubes them up nicely.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is better than expected.</li>
            <li>Really like the mustache trimmer .</li>
            <li>He likes it very well...for the trimmer and for the way it shaves.  </li>
            <li>He also said it was very plastic and was unsure of it&#x27;s water resistance.  </li>
            <li>Really like a child&#x27;s toy pretend electric razor that a child can pretend to be Daddy shaving in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>For a newbie, it does everything I reasonably want, at an acceptable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cordless feature is very convenient and lightens the weight and awkwardness of the whole unit.  </li>
            <li>Hubby was looking for an electric shaver to use when we travel, so he doesn&#x27;t have to shlep his whole kit.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t hear it in the next room when he&#x27;s shaving and his head doesn&#x27;t ring from the sound.  </li>
            <li>but if it works, then it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is fantastic, my husband has only charged it once in 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Once opened, the box contained the shaver (ready to go) and the charging cable.  </li>
            <li>Very noisy and does not seem to shave very well.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;I&#x27;d get it if it were much cheaper - say, $15 - but not for the price</li>
            <li>This one is really light weight and very quiet!  </li>
            <li>Lithium battery is very light&lt;</li>
            <li>LED light to signal low battery&lt;</li>
            <li>I have had much closer shaves</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have a LED readout to find out about battery charge, but if you plug it in once a week you won&#x27;t really need that function.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave</li>
            <li>The cost is reasonable, and the brand reliable.</li>
            <li>but this really pushes the limit.</li>
            <li>It gives him a close shave without much irritation.  </li>
            <li>So overall, nice as a backup unit or travel razor, but I wouldn&#x27;t want this as my only shaver.</li>
            <li>However, after using it for the last few weeks I&#x27;ve also noticed that it works very well, giving a good close shave that is as good as my more expensive shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure glad I bought this on a open box price,because it&#x27;s not worth the asking price new.</li>
            <li>The other issues were noted earlier: the lack of  charging dock, good charging indicator or cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li>Shaver broke the second I used it and tried to clean it.</li>
            <li>There are more expensive electric razors out there, and I&#x27;m uncertain as to this one&#x27;s performance over time, but I&#x27;m impressed so far, and see no need yet to purchase a more expensive one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery charges quickly and appears to last a reasonable time period but the rotor speed does not seem particularly fast.</li>
            <li>I bought a similar Remington shaver before and it had a pouch and a brush to clean the shaver.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave and the battery gives long service with one charge.</li>
            <li>full charge will bring it back.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He found the shave to be average, requiring more than one pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a small bottle of oil included to lubricate the cutters after washing&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a good job of getting a close and even shave, but it does require going over the same areas more than once if you have very tough and course hairs.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves his new shaver!</li>
            <li>I was ready to order new blades for my Norelco and said, what the heck let me give this one a try.</li>
            <li>, I have to say that the Norelco seemed to do an even better job, and the construction seemed a lot less flimsy on the surface.</li>
            <li>But after using it a while I&#x27;ve decided it doesn&#x27;t shave as close or glide over my face as smoothly as my older Norelco.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my older cheaper model.</li>
            <li>My husband, however, was less satisfied with this particular razor.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, he rarely if ever packs a whole razor for travel, preferring to pick up an even lighter, disposable hand razor from the hotel or CVS when we&#x27;re travelling (since TSA starting banning razors on carry-ons).</li>
            <li>However, it does a decent job on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Thought about using it for manscaping.</li>
            <li>Charged time is 60 min which is decent.</li>
            <li>The charging indicator is a single light which indicates that it is charging but not the percentage, or when it is charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Beyond that, Remington&#x27;s lithium power system drives high energy and torque to deliver 60 minutes of cordless shaving per charge.</li>
            <li>great price and works as well as my expensive ($130+) nurelco.</li>
            <li>skin has to be clean and dry.</li>
            <li>Normally shave with a blade, but it serves as a &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; when traveling or in-between shaves</li>
            <li>The shaver is able to be operated when it is plugged in, so even if the battery is completely dead you can still plug it in and shave.</li>
            <li>first shave was definitely not as expected.  </li>
            <li>hed rather use a normal razor.</li>
            <li>Power - Using Remington&#x27;s powerful lithium battery, you&#x27;ll get 60 minutes of cordless runtime after only a 90-minute</li>
            <li>You do need to charge it for a pretty long time when you first get it.</li>
            <li>In terms of the shave, it was adequate, but little things detracted from it overall making it not as easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You must clean it after every use, because the first time I did not clean it after one shave.</li>
            <li>I use a small moustache brush to clean out most of the debris and then just separate the pieces and drop them in a glass with a drop or two of Dawn and let them soak, then rinse and put them on a paper towel to dry.</li>
            <li>This shaver was just a little more than buying a blade set for my old one</li>
            <li>I like this new one being powered by lithium batteries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his new toy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been doing that since new.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price for this new razor.</li>
            <li>Still need a new razor, will NOT be considering Remington.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that in comparison, the new shaver is junk.</li>
            <li>Was going to order a much more expensive electric razor and used it twice now and very very close shaves!!  </li>
            <li>Also makes it harder to clean.</li>
            <li>The shaver is light, and the dc adapter is much smaller than my prior shaver</li>
            <li>This is now a light weight piece of junk that seemed more like a fake kids toy.</li>
            <li>Wow, after just a few days it would no longer hold a charge for more than about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>not a heavy duty old Norelco, didn&#x27;t cost as much either, works well.</li>
            <li>It’s lightweight (Not heavy like his older one.)</li>
            <li>As far as a close shave, it is comparable to his older shaver, which doesn’t compare to using a razor.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised at the quality.  </li>
            <li>During my second shave the hairs from the first shave started falling out all over my sink.</li>
            <li>Gave it as a gift to a teen as his first razor.  </li>
            <li>This unit tugged at my facial hair more than any other rotary shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Granted, it has a lower price point, so you can&#x27;t expect the same ease of grip and comfort in holding that comes with higher end razors.  </li>
            <li>The handle is less comfortable than in the higher-end models.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newbie to electric razors, and maybe because my Chinese facial hair luckily matched with razor or maybe because of my electric razors inexperience, but I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I found it moved quickly to one side or the other.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it&#x27;s less sleek and more simpler in design than those higher-end models, but its run time is the longest I have come across with these shavers so far--a whole sixty minutes.</li>
            <li>My favorite electric razor was made by Wahl, but discontinued years ago and it is getting harder and harder to find replacement heads and foils for it.</li>
            <li>Works well ,but does not shave quite as close as my old Norelco-</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my old one was.</li>
            <li>The Remington worked very well especially the Lithium Battery.</li>
            <li>He loves this shaver and it shaves him close without nicking his sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the power/shaving of the old one I&#x27;ve had for years the r845.</li>
            <li>It does not come with a charging dock, but plugs directly into the wall.  </li>
            <li>and it is ready for the next morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As we all know, teenagers tend to have sensitive skin, with acne, and he can use this without looking like he got in a fight with a knife.</li>
            <li>For example, the area immediately under the nose is a real struggle to reach and I find myself switching back to my Braun to reach these areas.</li>
            <li>Even though the Norelco is over a year old</li>
            <li>Add this to the fact that it offers a close shave, without pulling or pinching your skin, and you have a winner.  </li>
            <li>Was surprised to see that it was made in China.</li>
            <li>I am replacing a 10 year old Remington that still shaves well but won&#x27;t hold a charge at all.</li>
            <li>I was really  surprised.</li>
            <li>On this one a good trick is to use the detail trimmer to trim long hairs (or tough ones ) , and then finish the job with the razor heads.</li>
            <li>big beef is the feel of the plastic handle (cheap) and the three heads that, despite having double titanium rings, don&#x27;t feel that solid or stable on his face, especially when he&#x27;s running it over his jawline and neck.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t compare with the high end shaved I typically use, but is very serviceable.</li>
            <li>I usually have to go over my face several times in various directions to make sure it doesn&#x27;t leave any stubble.</li>
            <li>This shaver cut nearly as well as my manual blades, and it was accomplished in less than 1/5 the time and far easier.  </li>
            <li>Overall not a bad little razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a reasonable choice in the shaving category, but I would wait until it has been out long enough to where reviewers can tell whether it truly lasts over time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, none of this impresses hubby enough for him to get rid of his old razor.</li>
            <li>Not a very close shave and its not built very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Like any old NI-Cad or Ni-mhd....those batteries take a charge and the instant you start using them they are losing strength.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but not great for a close shave</li>
            <li>, I do usually finish with a quick pass of a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;o</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m being biased against this one based purely on looks, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to stand up to the Norelco line in terms of seeming as though it&#x27;s going to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li>The ads talk about how exceptional the cutting blades are.......bull.</li>
            <li>First the battery will not hold a charge only get half of shave</li>
            <li>In case it was just me, I left the shaver where one of my sons would grab it for a quick shave, in place of his usual one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He says that while some of the components are high end (titanium coated blades) other parts are not as sturdy or well thought out.  </li>
            <li>My previous Remington did not work very well.</li>
            <li>I then prop it up inside my medicine cabinet so that it can dry completely</li>
            <li>razor holds a charge for two and half weeks of Monday-Friday shaving and charges up in a couple of hours, ready to go again.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my significant other who was having trouble with another electric shaver</li>
            <li>If I do miss a day, I have to shave super slow with it or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have a solid shaver that&#x27;s a little harder to clean than one that feels so flimsy it&#x27;ll break next</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really at odds with the fact that these blades are supposed to be a longer-lasting, titanium version, because if the blades are going to last a long time, I&#x27;d like to feel that the construction overall is sturdy enough to where the rest of the product is going to last as long as the blades will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am able to fully charge it in less than an hour and it lasts for at least two weeks of shaving before I have to charge it again.</li>
            <li>The housing feels a little plasticy and maybe a bit too much creak and flex, but it hasn&#x27;t managed to break yet.</li>
            <li>This little guy works really well for the price.</li>
            <li>Very easy on the skin, too, you can barely feel it cutting.  </li>
            <li>it shows a little clock-type indicator showing how much time is left to charge.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> After a week for my skin to adjust i would have to say that this is the best shave I have ever gotten with an electric razor!  </li>
            <li> I did and it was excellent quality, unlike this.</li>
            <li> It worked great!  </li>
            <li> I was so impressed with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The triple head design seems to be of the lift and cut style, so if you&#x27;re prone to ingrown hairs, this might not be the best shaver for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver!</li>
            <li> , Norelco&#x27;s are out of my price range and this was a very good price and used some AmEx reward points too.  </li>

            <li> For the price this shaver is very good..</li>

            <li> The lithium battery is great</li>
            <li> So happy it&#x27;s here.</li>
            <li> great for that starter razor.</li>

            <li> The razor is as described, gives and excellent shave, the price was excellent and even with free shipping</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor.  </li>
            <li> An excellent product, for an outstanding price.</li>
            <li> Works really good makes a nice close shave!</li>
            <li> Very nice razor at a very respectable cost.</li>
            <li> It was so good</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m delighted to have bought it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> Im not a hairy guy, and Remmington makes good products.</li>
            <li> It has never given me a good close shave.</li>
            <li> This works as good as a norelco .</li>
            <li> However, for those who do, it&#x27;s good in that respect.  </li>
            <li> People do not realize it takes about a week of electric razor use to get good results.</li>
            <li> After a week of use the skin is smoother and you get a good shave from the electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It is noisy and does not give a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Good price , arrived on time and in tact .</li>
            <li> I guess I am spoiled by Norelco with a superior product.</li>
            <li> This provides a good shave for me.</li>
            <li> I have never had an electric that does as good of a job as a blade.  </li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> lightweight - gives a clean shave - very happy with it</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s also been impressed with the ability to run it under the faucet to clean out.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am a happy wife :-)</li>
            <li> Most reviews here are from experienced electric razor users.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll not hesitate to shop Amazon more often!  </li>
            <li> I was less happy with my Panasonic (women&#x27;s) razor and was very happy when I could replace it with a Remington, which I&#x27;d happily used for years until the rechargable battery gave out.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, there is no reason to buy this product, at whatever price.</li>
            <li> A cover for the business end of the shaver would be nice for packing in the suitcase&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I am pleased, good close shave.</li>
            <li> Works fine,thought it had some kind of indication of battery charge state,but does not.</li>
            <li> and fits in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li> Remington has always had decent, perfectly useable electric shavers, if not always built the sturdiest.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I happily looked at the great looking shaver in the new box.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is not attached to the cord after charging is a new and wonderful plus for my husband.</li>
            <li> It fits well in my hand, the razors heads flow smoothly across my face, and the unit holds a charge for a good length of time.</li>
            <li> A clean razor is a good razor.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been pretty happy with this one.  </li>
            <li> It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight</li>
            <li> This review is feedback from my husband: On the plus side, this shaver is very light and the battery lasts longer than many shavers.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised of a good product for more than a fair price.  </li>
            <li> Very good replacement for my old N---elco</li>
            <li> otherwise I am pleased</li>
            <li> Has been using it daily for a week now and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the razor.</li>
            <li> My guess is that it will break in and do better with use.  </li>
            <li> I am able to shave for one week without recharging the battery.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $20 for it.</li>
            <li> even tried the break-in period for 10 days like most razors recommend to train your beard.&lt;br /&gt;ther should be a minos rating so i could give a minos -10.</li>
            <li> so I wanted something with better battery life.  </li>
            <li> Spend a bit more and get the competitor brand.</li>
            <li> great shaver does the job it was made for very well</li>
            <li> I can say that the brand is very reliable, having happily used their products for years myself.  </li>
            <li> It felt more like a child&#x27;s toy.  </li>
            <li> This is just OK, I would have given this 2.5 stars if that was an option.</li>
            <li> While this does an OK job, it is nowhere close to the shave you get from using a blade cartridge with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> He used it to trim and refine his goatee and said, \\&quot;It does a better job than I thought it would, but I can&#x27;t see myself using this for the long-term.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They need to come up with a better package to put the razors in so they can tell if the razor was used before someone returned it.</li>
            <li> Shaving my husband&#x27;s face, this works okay, but for his mustache and goatee the trimmer does not edge well.</li>
            <li> If so, I would be able to recommend this shaver wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> I have been told by all that they are pleased.</li>
            <li> The reason I like an electric shaver is to avoid shaving off the top of a raised mole on my face.  </li>
            <li> Lasts for more than 60 minutes of run</li>
            <li> I like it so much better than the NORELCO I used before ($150 item).</li>
            <li> If I go for more than a day without shaving...</li>
            <li> It does not have some of the bells and whistles of a top of the line model , but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> One of the better razors for under 50.00.Titanium blades and pivoting head make for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> It is the best razor he has had in his entire lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> my shaver arrived in excellent order and entirely met my expectations it shaves as goodas any electric shaver I have owned if not</li>
            <li> better rergards</li>
            <li> Not too many bells and whistles, but who needs all ofnthat when you just need to shave.</li>
            <li> OK for an electric.  </li>
            <li> got this for fathers day, and so far my dad has been loving it, the charge lasts as good two weeks and its very easy to shave with.</li>
            <li> but it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> first impression of this Remington razor weren&#x27;t so good.</li>
            <li> This one has the five minute quick charge and you can use it plugged in, two nice features.  </li>
            <li> He also liked how quickly it charged.</li>
            <li> The heads are easy to clean with warm water and soap if you like.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight, in fact I would say too light.</li>
            <li> And its trimmer blades fixed my sideburns just great too.  </li>
            <li> All in all - as far as shavers go - a great</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave and is easy to clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on my face and neck and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The pivot head seemed to fight me rather than flowing easily.</li>
            <li> It is a satisfactory shave, plenty of oomph to do the job and easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> It’s a great color – my favorite (Yes, I’m a visual person, so that matters.)</li>
            <li> If I let it grow all weekend, it is easy to shave off, but day-to-day shaving can be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old remington razor, but Ok for the price.</li>
            <li> The shaver head opened fine and rinsed easy.</li>
            <li> continues the tri-head tradition of a lot of razors used nowadays and makes for a pretty nice shave.</li>
            <li> GREAT shaver so far,  using for about two weeks now,  been using remington shavers for a few years,  best one yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a good basic razor and I will definitely use it for 3+ day growth, but still not my perfect razor, so the quest continues.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it is easy to clean - press a lever and the top pops up, making it easy to clean the razors</li>
            <li> I was delighted with the performance of my new razor.  </li>
            <li> WORKS FINE AND NO COMPLAINTS</li>
            <li> The razor itself works fine.</li>
            <li> Honestly this one cuts exactly the same as the one I had before, it cuts great except around the mustache area and some on the neck, it still cuts those areas but not well.</li>
            <li> It’s supper quite, a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I very much enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> and it is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> This Remington feels bulky and cheap in my hands.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shavers, fantastic price</li>
            <li> Clean up is easy when all you have to do is rinse it under water .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rechargeable (the light shows when that&#x27;s needed)---and</li>
            <li> it glides smoothly</li>
            <li> I then ran it for an entire hour on the counter and that was a great sign of the amount of time I could get out of it.  </li>
            <li> While I am not against plastic, it just felt cheap for some reason as compared to another I have.  </li>
            <li> It did not move smoothly as it shifted around.  </li>
            <li> However, there is something that feels cheap and plasticky about the construction.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap product and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> my husband loves this, it is so light weight.</li>
            <li> my husband says it doesnt give him a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Cheap product compared to Norelco.</li>
            <li> It easily rinses clean under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and does the job.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I know products need to be made cheaply</li>
            <li> cheap.</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It certainly does a good job when first out-of-the-box, and I would give it a five star review</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that this unit has a very cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li> I like these on the road or in the car as they are quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use</li>
            <li> one smooth swipe it clear cut a path across my face that would make any standard blade razor proud!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Comparing to a $120 razor, this does not yield as clean cut</li>
            <li> a super smooth shave</li>
            <li> So clean up is quicker and easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and charges quickly, and while not quite as comfortable as my Norelco, it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> The shaver charges up fine and holds a charge good enough to get about five days to a week worth of shaves before needing recharged.</li>
            <li> He is, however, comparing it to a very high end razor which he has used for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next day, with a good two days growth on my face</li>
            <li> I had to keep going over the same areas to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> He had the same feeling, that it just wasn&#x27;t as good as he was used to.</li>
            <li> This thing does not rotate quickly...barely cuts even on full charge.  </li>
            <li> Good low cost shaver!</li>
            <li> Quite good actually.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is not bad, but isn’t as close as a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> He likes his Panasonic better (but it is the top of their line) and while satisfied with the Remington, finds it just average.  </li>
            <li> CAME QUICK</li>
            <li> Quick close shave.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re able to get a shaver with independently floating heads you&#x27;re better off.</li>
            <li> Quick charge:</li>
            <li> Lithium Power Series R5 Rotary Shaver is built for comfort, speed, precision, and, most importantly, high performance.</li>
            <li> And when you&#x27;re finished, it washes clean right under the faucet.ight under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Deliver was within a few days, and the razor is beautiful and efficient.</li>
            <li> Got a refund (which was quick and easy, THANKS).  </li>
            <li> longer battery life ,much shorter charge time ,removable batteries,very easy to clean.all of these make it a winner.</li>
            <li> I is gentle and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfectly serviceable rotary shaver, and for ladies&#x27; shaving such as legs, it did a quick and serviceable job, certainly better than the ladies&#x27; electric razor I ordinarily use.</li>
            <li> But given the fact that shaving is fast and easy, that&#x27;s something we can overlook.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find it to replace my dying Norelco as it was a reasonable price point compared to others that do the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a straight-forward rotary shaver - inexpensive and lightweight, it&#x27;s a nice extra unit to toss in your carry-on for a quick touch-up before arrival at your destination.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The head unit is easy to clean with running water, but the individual cutter wheels are easily dropped if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Great little machine.</li>
            <li> Also the whole thing is made out of a cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old Remington R845 which wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more</li>
            <li> I turned it on fully expecting it to fall to pieces under the overwhelming strength of my masculine chin</li>
            <li> Razor blades makes the skin of the face rough and prevents getting a good result from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> charge.&lt;br /&gt;-Washable Design - Keep your shaver fresh.</li>
            <li> Also positive is that the battery, once charged, lasts a long time, again good for travel.</li>
            <li> This razor does not get that good, close shave that we&#x27;ve seen with other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I will buy another (when the price is right) to have when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to manipulate much to get a neat and clean shave despite the two days of growth I had established to test it out.  </li>
            <li> For the average user this is a good model for the cost.</li>
            <li> Pay a little more and get a better quality shaver.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to clean, big deal.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a smooth job of shaving, though it&#x27;s more rough to hold than the higher-end models.</li>
            <li> My only comment on the razor is that it is all plastic which makes it very light</li>
            <li> The rotary shaver works quietly and produces very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The hair is very fine and they lay flat as they emerge.</li>
            <li> I thought my husband would be excited to get this new razor, but he wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to order the new REMINGTON PRODUCTS R5 LITHIUM POWER SERIES ROTARY SHAVER, for my husband.</li>
            <li> broke first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t shave quite as well as my first Remington rotary</li>
            <li> first charge of razor lasted dec 8 2014 to march 14 2015.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give this unit a try because it was on sale for $30, the same price it would cost to replace the blades on my much better quality Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> I waited on this review since the first one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
            <li> Our son&#x27;s first electric razor.</li>
            <li> Having recently replaced my Remington with a newer model of the same line, I am very happy, but it is a different razor and I can not argue with his differing experience.</li>
            <li> This is one razor that you cannot judge on first appearance.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was the cheaper feel of the case.</li>
            <li> Husband is pretty picky about his razors, but this one fills the bill..</li>
            <li> Ultimately, my Braun also shaves a bit closer than this Remington, though admittedly the Braun is much more expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charge holds for a long time, and it&#x27;s really easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It doesn’t irritate the skin and the cutters don’t get hot.  </li>
            <li> In these months it has held up pretty well.</li>
            <li> Its Precision Cut shaving heads with titanium-coated Twin Track blades smoothly cut long hair and stubble for an ultra close, comfortable shave every time.</li>
            <li> While it does have excellent battery life, all other aspects were a let down.  </li>
            <li> working fine, better with a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it has dual bladed shavers and other nice features.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the only small downisde is it does not give a very close shave , but however , Remignton shavers tend to be very durable , they tend to last 10 years or more without a blade change , unlike Norelco shavers , which are excellent for about 6 months , but then their blades lose their edge.</li>
            <li> This particular electric shaver seems to carry on the tradition of providing the user with a good shave, not a great shave, but one that is good enough.</li>
            <li> So, it seems like a good value for the price, but I&#x27;ll update later if necessary.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it&#x27;s better than the older version of the same model.</li>
            <li> so it takes up less room in the luggage which is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleanup is incredibly easy, as the head snaps up with a push of a latch button, and you simply run the tap water over the face and insides of the razor body.  </li>
            <li> The head had a built in wobble to supposedly make it easy to go around your chin and such.  </li>
            <li> My first concern with this shave was that it is very lightweight and has a very plastic feel to it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have independently floating heads which makes the shave much less effective and comfortable than a shaver that does.</li>
            <li> Second one charged up fine, used it for almost three weeks before recharging.  </li>
            <li> Use a little Shaver Saver in the spray can and it lubes them up nicely.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is better than expected.</li>
            <li> Really like the mustache trimmer .</li>
            <li> He likes it very well...for the trimmer and for the way it shaves.  </li>
            <li> He also said it was very plastic and was unsure of it&#x27;s water resistance.  </li>
            <li> Really like a child&#x27;s toy pretend electric razor that a child can pretend to be Daddy shaving in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> For a newbie, it does everything I reasonably want, at an acceptable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cordless feature is very convenient and lightens the weight and awkwardness of the whole unit.  </li>
            <li> Hubby was looking for an electric shaver to use when we travel, so he doesn&#x27;t have to shlep his whole kit.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t hear it in the next room when he&#x27;s shaving and his head doesn&#x27;t ring from the sound.  </li>
            <li> but if it works, then it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is fantastic, my husband has only charged it once in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Once opened, the box contained the shaver (ready to go) and the charging cable.  </li>
            <li> Very noisy and does not seem to shave very well.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;I&#x27;d get it if it were much cheaper - say, $15 - but not for the price</li>
            <li> This one is really light weight and very quiet!  </li>
            <li> Lithium battery is very light&lt;</li>
            <li> LED light to signal low battery&lt;</li>
            <li> I have had much closer shaves</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have a LED readout to find out about battery charge, but if you plug it in once a week you won&#x27;t really need that function.</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave</li>
            <li> The cost is reasonable, and the brand reliable.</li>
            <li> but this really pushes the limit.</li>
            <li> It gives him a close shave without much irritation.  </li>
            <li> So overall, nice as a backup unit or travel razor, but I wouldn&#x27;t want this as my only shaver.</li>
            <li> However, after using it for the last few weeks I&#x27;ve also noticed that it works very well, giving a good close shave that is as good as my more expensive shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure glad I bought this on a open box price,because it&#x27;s not worth the asking price new.</li>
            <li> The other issues were noted earlier: the lack of  charging dock, good charging indicator or cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li> Shaver broke the second I used it and tried to clean it.</li>
            <li> There are more expensive electric razors out there, and I&#x27;m uncertain as to this one&#x27;s performance over time, but I&#x27;m impressed so far, and see no need yet to purchase a more expensive one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery charges quickly and appears to last a reasonable time period but the rotor speed does not seem particularly fast.</li>
            <li> I bought a similar Remington shaver before and it had a pouch and a brush to clean the shaver.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave and the battery gives long service with one charge.</li>
            <li> full charge will bring it back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He found the shave to be average, requiring more than one pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a small bottle of oil included to lubricate the cutters after washing&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a good job of getting a close and even shave, but it does require going over the same areas more than once if you have very tough and course hairs.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver!</li>
            <li> I was ready to order new blades for my Norelco and said, what the heck let me give this one a try.</li>
            <li> , I have to say that the Norelco seemed to do an even better job, and the construction seemed a lot less flimsy on the surface.</li>
            <li> But after using it a while I&#x27;ve decided it doesn&#x27;t shave as close or glide over my face as smoothly as my older Norelco.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my older cheaper model.</li>
            <li> My husband, however, was less satisfied with this particular razor.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, he rarely if ever packs a whole razor for travel, preferring to pick up an even lighter, disposable hand razor from the hotel or CVS when we&#x27;re travelling (since TSA starting banning razors on carry-ons).</li>
            <li> However, it does a decent job on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Thought about using it for manscaping.</li>
            <li> Charged time is 60 min which is decent.</li>
            <li> The charging indicator is a single light which indicates that it is charging but not the percentage, or when it is charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Beyond that, Remington&#x27;s lithium power system drives high energy and torque to deliver 60 minutes of cordless shaving per charge.</li>
            <li> great price and works as well as my expensive ($130+) nurelco.</li>
            <li> skin has to be clean and dry.</li>
            <li> Normally shave with a blade, but it serves as a &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; when traveling or in-between shaves</li>
            <li> The shaver is able to be operated when it is plugged in, so even if the battery is completely dead you can still plug it in and shave.</li>
            <li> first shave was definitely not as expected.  </li>
            <li> hed rather use a normal razor.</li>
            <li> Power - Using Remington&#x27;s powerful lithium battery, you&#x27;ll get 60 minutes of cordless runtime after only a 90-minute</li>
            <li> You do need to charge it for a pretty long time when you first get it.</li>
            <li> In terms of the shave, it was adequate, but little things detracted from it overall making it not as easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You must clean it after every use, because the first time I did not clean it after one shave.</li>
            <li> I use a small moustache brush to clean out most of the debris and then just separate the pieces and drop them in a glass with a drop or two of Dawn and let them soak, then rinse and put them on a paper towel to dry.</li>
            <li> This shaver was just a little more than buying a blade set for my old one</li>
            <li> I like this new one being powered by lithium batteries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his new toy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been doing that since new.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for this new razor.</li>
            <li> Still need a new razor, will NOT be considering Remington.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that in comparison, the new shaver is junk.</li>
            <li> Was going to order a much more expensive electric razor and used it twice now and very very close shaves!!  </li>
            <li> Also makes it harder to clean.</li>
            <li> The shaver is light, and the dc adapter is much smaller than my prior shaver</li>
            <li> This is now a light weight piece of junk that seemed more like a fake kids toy.</li>
            <li> Wow, after just a few days it would no longer hold a charge for more than about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> not a heavy duty old Norelco, didn&#x27;t cost as much either, works well.</li>
            <li> It’s lightweight (Not heavy like his older one.)</li>
            <li> As far as a close shave, it is comparable to his older shaver, which doesn’t compare to using a razor.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised at the quality.  </li>
            <li> During my second shave the hairs from the first shave started falling out all over my sink.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift to a teen as his first razor.  </li>
            <li> This unit tugged at my facial hair more than any other rotary shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Granted, it has a lower price point, so you can&#x27;t expect the same ease of grip and comfort in holding that comes with higher end razors.  </li>
            <li> The handle is less comfortable than in the higher-end models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to electric razors, and maybe because my Chinese facial hair luckily matched with razor or maybe because of my electric razors inexperience, but I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I found it moved quickly to one side or the other.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it&#x27;s less sleek and more simpler in design than those higher-end models, but its run time is the longest I have come across with these shavers so far--a whole sixty minutes.</li>
            <li> My favorite electric razor was made by Wahl, but discontinued years ago and it is getting harder and harder to find replacement heads and foils for it.</li>
            <li> Works well ,but does not shave quite as close as my old Norelco-</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my old one was.</li>
            <li> The Remington worked very well especially the Lithium Battery.</li>
            <li> He loves this shaver and it shaves him close without nicking his sensitive face.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the power/shaving of the old one I&#x27;ve had for years the r845.</li>
            <li> It does not come with a charging dock, but plugs directly into the wall.  </li>
            <li> and it is ready for the next morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As we all know, teenagers tend to have sensitive skin, with acne, and he can use this without looking like he got in a fight with a knife.</li>
            <li> For example, the area immediately under the nose is a real struggle to reach and I find myself switching back to my Braun to reach these areas.</li>
            <li> Even though the Norelco is over a year old</li>
            <li> Add this to the fact that it offers a close shave, without pulling or pinching your skin, and you have a winner.  </li>
            <li> Was surprised to see that it was made in China.</li>
            <li> I am replacing a 10 year old Remington that still shaves well but won&#x27;t hold a charge at all.</li>
            <li> I was really  surprised.</li>
            <li> On this one a good trick is to use the detail trimmer to trim long hairs (or tough ones ) , and then finish the job with the razor heads.</li>
            <li> big beef is the feel of the plastic handle (cheap) and the three heads that, despite having double titanium rings, don&#x27;t feel that solid or stable on his face, especially when he&#x27;s running it over his jawline and neck.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t compare with the high end shaved I typically use, but is very serviceable.</li>
            <li> I usually have to go over my face several times in various directions to make sure it doesn&#x27;t leave any stubble.</li>
            <li> This shaver cut nearly as well as my manual blades, and it was accomplished in less than 1/5 the time and far easier.  </li>
            <li> Overall not a bad little razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a reasonable choice in the shaving category, but I would wait until it has been out long enough to where reviewers can tell whether it truly lasts over time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, none of this impresses hubby enough for him to get rid of his old razor.</li>
            <li> Not a very close shave and its not built very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Like any old NI-Cad or Ni-mhd....those batteries take a charge and the instant you start using them they are losing strength.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not great for a close shave</li>
            <li> , I do usually finish with a quick pass of a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;o</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m being biased against this one based purely on looks, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to stand up to the Norelco line in terms of seeming as though it&#x27;s going to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> The ads talk about how exceptional the cutting blades are.......bull.</li>
            <li> First the battery will not hold a charge only get half of shave</li>
            <li> In case it was just me, I left the shaver where one of my sons would grab it for a quick shave, in place of his usual one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He says that while some of the components are high end (titanium coated blades) other parts are not as sturdy or well thought out.  </li>
            <li> My previous Remington did not work very well.</li>
            <li> I then prop it up inside my medicine cabinet so that it can dry completely</li>
            <li> razor holds a charge for two and half weeks of Monday-Friday shaving and charges up in a couple of hours, ready to go again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my significant other who was having trouble with another electric shaver</li>
            <li> If I do miss a day, I have to shave super slow with it or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have a solid shaver that&#x27;s a little harder to clean than one that feels so flimsy it&#x27;ll break next</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really at odds with the fact that these blades are supposed to be a longer-lasting, titanium version, because if the blades are going to last a long time, I&#x27;d like to feel that the construction overall is sturdy enough to where the rest of the product is going to last as long as the blades will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am able to fully charge it in less than an hour and it lasts for at least two weeks of shaving before I have to charge it again.</li>
            <li> The housing feels a little plasticy and maybe a bit too much creak and flex, but it hasn&#x27;t managed to break yet.</li>
            <li> This little guy works really well for the price.</li>
            <li> Very easy on the skin, too, you can barely feel it cutting.  </li>
            <li> it shows a little clock-type indicator showing how much time is left to charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He said he has to go over his face twice, but that was typical, with the exception of his high end foil razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a previous remington electric razor that I had for three years which I liked, but unfortunately was powered by nicad batteries and finally gave out.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a replacement that was a few years old, same basic model.</li>
            <li> If you tend to let your facial hair grow long, use a trimmer before shaver.  </li>
            <li> We will see how long it will last.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a really long time (over an hour total run time).  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the titanium coated blades will last a long time too.  </li>
            <li> Titanium coated blades should last a long time&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I am a little surprised at this, as his experience is exactly opposite mine.  </li>
            <li> the plus side, its worst quality (the hollow plastic handle) makes it lightweight and best for travel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also does not have a charging stand, the cord plugs into the razor and only a single LED for charge status, so</li>
            <li> husband tried this shaver on his face, and even though he initially scoffed at it for being lightweight and seeming to be of poor construction than he was used to, he had to admit it did a perfectly fine job, just the same as his usual</li>
            <li> However it does appear to hold a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t timed it, so I can&#x27;t say how long.  </li>
            <li> shaver does hold a long charge.</li>
            <li> Long battery life, can also work plugged in.</li>
            <li> I tried other electric shavers such as Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> My husband constantly complains about his other shaver because of the noise in his ear when he shaves.  </li>
            <li> It also did not come with a cleaning brush, a little thing but one which is generally provided  </li>
            <li> I would say that this Remington Shaver is a above average shaver.  </li>
            <li> His current one has a highly sensitive and flexible head that springs and subtly responds to the changes in surface.</li>
            <li> It is held up by a small piece of plastic that refuses to actually keep the trimmer open while shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li> The power button and the button for the pop up trimmer were a bit hard but it might be just due to how new it</li>
            <li> Cosmetically, it looks virtually identical to his old razor, but he soon complained that the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; was unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> item works as expected.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is really rough and pulls.</li>
            <li> It just feels rough on my face.</li>
            <li> But I actually had to go and use my everyday Norelco electric razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li> The fliptop feels like it could break if not handled carefully.  </li>
            <li> My previous shaver (Philips) did not give as close a shave and took twice as long.</li>
            <li> Meaning the charge holds a lot long and stronger than typical rechargeable shavers.</li>
            <li> I needed an additional shaver to take on trips and thought this would be a decent, lower quality shaver to use in a hurry, but this Remington shaver is of extremely poor quality.</li>
            <li> and he uses it every other day.  </li>
            <li> Poorly made, not likely to last</li>
            <li> Only complaint is no cover or plastic head protecter.</li>
            <li> the battery life was a let down.  </li>
            <li> The Remington R5 rotary razor is average to above average, but not exceptional in performance, according to my husband.  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t used to this design, it might alarm you with the slight tugging feeling it gives while shaving.</li>
            <li> I then recharged it slightly (per instructions) and did get the five minute shave time.  </li>
            <li> He thought the Remington was a disposable sample, not worthy of the $40 plus pricetag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a hidden cost that needs to be recognized.</li>
            <li> It takes less time to recharge than others in the marketplace.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for a long period of time and the blades are dull as can be.</li>
            <li> opening the package I was REALLY disappointed, as it was incredibly light weight and &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> fell apart with a little bumo</li>
            <li> Also, the charge seems weak and does not really last.</li>
            <li> It feels a little light/cheap for what you are using</li>
            <li> If there was a way, I would add a little weight to it.</li>
            <li> Does not make a clean shave a little disappointed .</li>
            <li> All it has is the green</li>
            <li> While I understand it made no mention on the box of a travel pouch, I certainly expected to find a cover for the shaver heads to at least protect them.  </li>
            <li> this came with a dead battery, charged it for 24 hrs like it say&#x27;s put still no power.</li>
            <li> and I do not have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s goes dead  also</li>
            <li> There is no weight at all to balance the shaver, the blades feel like they are losing a tug of war with my whiskers with pretty painful results.</li>
            <li> I deducted a star because he says sometimes it feels like it loses a little power while he&#x27;s shaving.</li>
            <li> it is a painful experience since the razor really pulls.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed because the Remington brand did not fail me in the past.</li>
            <li> but not sure if that will hurt the durability.  </li>
            <li> and I have I a heavy beard!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write these things -</li>
            <li> The shaver head is decent given the price range but too often pulls on hairs, leading to an uncomfortably painful shave.    </li>
            <li> Seems a little weak on power.</li>
            <li> The razor pulls to hard on the whiskers.</li>
            <li> It feels as if the head is dull.</li>
            <li> #34;Super Close&amp;#34; as that one has been hard.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve read that you are supposed to replace the shavers regularly, or at least some part of them</li>
            <li> the motor speed for the blades is slow even when plugged in to the wall contacted Amazon and replacement is on its way</li>
            <li> gives a close shave, but the motor is slow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much less expensive than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as good as his dad&#x27;s $100 Norelco, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than paying for a shaver that does not do the job you expect it to.</li>
            <li> This one was irritating and was leaving stubble behind.  </li>
            <li> The build quality leaves a lot to be desired, and I found it a little painful to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to use the trimmer for anything but the lightest application, leaving you to use the main shaver head to painfully pull against longer hairs that are impossible to cut with the trimmer.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this razor, I&#x27;m going back to Norelco.</li>
            <li> Sorry Remington, this one needs to go.</li>
            <li> Sorry..</li>
            <li> The worst aspect of the shaver is the pop-up detail trimmer on the back.</li>
            <li> I should mention that my beard is weird.</li>
            <li> Bad shave.</li>
            <li> disappointed in the shave given by this razor.</li>
            <li> Disappointed this was happening.</li>
            <li> So I was just hoping... and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I really hated the head on the darn thing.  </li>
            <li> Horrible shaver.</li>
            <li> the worst electric razor ever, It doesn&#x27;t cut it pulls the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Horrible design.</li>
            <li> idiot would add their picture to this message, and why would I care to see what others purchases?!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> An excellent product, for an outstanding price. I very much enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Used for 1 month and it&#x27;s no working</li>
            <li> lightweight - gives a clean shave - very happy with it</li>
            <li> Horrible shaver. No power. Bad shave.</li>
            <li> It was so good I bought another one to take with me when I travel, and as a spare. There is nothing worse than paying for a shaver that does not do the job you expect it to. My previous shaver (Philips) did not give as close a shave and took twice as long.</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T BEAT IT FOR THE COST. WORKS FINE AND NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL. CAME QUICK AND AS STATED.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he just loves it. He said it is the best shaver he has ever used.</li>
            <li> My husband got the razor today for Christmas. He said it was the closest shave he has ever had with an electric razor. This is a great seller so buy from him.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing and works great! I bought it to use on the Residents at a Nursing Home I work at. It gives a close shave and is easy to clean! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> The razor is as described, gives and excellent shave, the price was excellent and even with free shipping it arrived on time as promised.</li>
            <li> Long-lasting charge.  Normally shave with a blade, but it serves as a &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; when traveling or in-between shaves ... can&#x27;t compare with closeness of blade shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband just loves it he likes the way that the head comes off and it is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I tried other electric shavers such as Philips Norelco but this one does it for me. Others stop shaving after a week, but this one still works after two weeks.That is great. I do not need to change blades every week like the Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fits my needs and I&#x27;m delighted to have bought it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  item works as expected. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a previous remington electric razor that I had for three years which I liked, but unfortunately was powered by nicad batteries and finally gave out. I like this new one being powered by lithium batteries. I am able to fully charge it in less than an hour and it lasts for at least two weeks of shaving before I have to charge it again. Honestly this one cuts exactly the same as the one I had before, it cuts great except around the mustache area and some on the neck, it still cuts those areas but not well. The shaver is light, and the dc adapter is much smaller than my prior shaver so it takes up less room in the luggage which is nice. The shaver is able to be operated when it is plugged in, so even if the battery is completely dead you can still plug it in and shave. I don&#x27;t get any razor burn at all using it, but I have been using an electric shaver for years, so I may just have a tolerance for it.</li>
            <li> great price for a great shave</li>
            <li> Works well ,but does not shave quite as close as my old Norelco- otherwise I am pleased</li>
            <li> The razor itself works fine. The trimmer is really rough and pulls. Also the whole thing is made out of a cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it!  Has been using it daily for a week now and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance. Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> My son is very happy with this.  it was a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I had some reservations before ordering, but have none now after using it. Very nice razor at a very respectable cost.</li>
            <li> Quick close shave. Great price.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my old one was.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because the Remington brand did not fail me in the past. This does not shave close and pinches or pull the hair while shaving, ouch.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. It&#x27;s his new toy. Its a great add to a gift</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the razor. The battery life is better than expected. Hope to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> I will buy another (when the price is right) to have when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaves and long-lasting battery life.</li>
            <li> Does not make a clean shave a little disappointed .</li>
            <li> broke first time I used it. fell apart with a little bumo</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t shave quite as well as my first Remington rotary but it was pretty good.  My guess is that it will break in and do better with use.  It&#x27;s easy on my face and neck and cleans easily.  This shaver was just a little more than buying a blade set for my old one so it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> Very good replacement for my old N---elco</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it has dual bladed shavers and other nice features. But after using it a while I&#x27;ve decided it doesn&#x27;t shave as close or glide over my face as smoothly as my older Norelco.</li>
            <li> The Remington worked very well especially the Lithium Battery. I am able to shave for one week without recharging the battery. My previous Remington did not work very well. I had to recharge the battery after two shaves.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband and he just LOVES it!! I am a happy wife :-)</li>
            <li> This was a great item, got it at a great price</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable. Exelent kip</li>
            <li> This shaver left a lot to be desired.  While it does have excellent battery life, all other aspects were a let down.  My last shaver was a Philips PT730 which did everything well except the battery life was a let down.  If that shaver and the Remington had a baby then I would definitely buy that shaver.  This Remington feels bulky and cheap in my hands.  I usually have to go over my face several times in various directions to make sure it doesn&#x27;t leave any stubble. If I wait an extra day in between shaves, it will catch on the hair and pull it versus cut it.  It&#x27;s been doing that since new.  If I do miss a day, I have to shave super slow with it or just wait until I can use a razor.  I don&#x27;t think it should hurt when you use a shaver...  I think I&#x27;m going back to Philips shavers after this one dies on me which hopefully will be soon.</li>
            <li> disappointed in the shave given by this razor. does not get close enough and the sideburn trimmer does not trim well</li>
            <li> I bought this for my significant other who was having trouble with another electric shaver I bought him 2 Christmases ago.  He loves this shaver and it shaves him close without nicking his sensitive face.  I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> got this for fathers day, and so far my dad has been loving it, the charge lasts as good two weeks and its very easy to shave with.</li>
            <li> Shaver broke the second I used it and tried to clean it. Cannot get the pieces back together. Trying to contact for a refund/exchange of item. You must clean it after every use, because the first time I did not clean it after one shave. During my second shave the hairs from the first shave started falling out all over my sink. Im not a hairy guy, and Remmington makes good products. Disappointed this was happening.</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shavers, fantastic price</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old remington razor, but Ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Razor pulls and nips. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great.  My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Seems a little weak on power. Should have bought a corded one instead.</li>
            <li> first charge of razor lasted dec 8 2014 to march 14 2015. so 4 months how awesome is that.alot longer than i thought it would last.let you know ayear from now  to see if it still works update to come?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the power/shaving of the old one I&#x27;ve had for years the r845. Wish they still made that one.</li>
            <li> For $49.00 I took a shot.  I am very surprised of a good product for more than a fair price.  Was going to order a much more expensive electric razor and used it twice now and very very close shaves!!  This razor has the 60 minute battery Lithium life so should stay charged as needed and only 90 minutes  full charge will bring it back.  Not a $300 shaver, but any closer, I won&#x27;t have any skin left!</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give this unit a try because it was on sale for $30, the same price it would cost to replace the blades on my much better quality Philips Norelco. I should have just bought the replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that this unit has a very cheap feel to it. The head is not spring-loaded and it feels like it&#x27;s going to fall off. Also makes it harder to clean. It doesn&#x27;t have independently floating heads which makes the shave much less effective and comfortable than a shaver that does. It just feels rough on my face. Also (and not the end of the world) the product description picture of the &amp;#34;3 Stage Indicator&amp;#34; is misleading...it shows a little clock-type indicator showing how much time is left to charge. This unit doesn&#x27;t have anything like that. All it has is the green light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If budget is an issue this unit will work for you but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $20 for it. If you&#x27;re able to get a shaver with independently floating heads you&#x27;re better off.</li>
            <li> the worst electric razor ever, It doesn&#x27;t cut it pulls the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I even tried the break-in period for 10 days like most razors recommend to train your beard.&lt;br /&gt;ther should be a minos rating so i could give a minos -10. A total rip off.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Really like the mustache trimmer .</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift to a teen as his first razor.  No complaints yet.</li>
            <li> Poorly made, not likely to last</li>
            <li> longer battery life ,much shorter charge time ,removable batteries,very easy to clean.all of these make it a winner.</li>
            <li> I only had the razor for 9 months and now it is not working.  Will not charge or turn on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my older cheaper model.</li>
            <li> I waited on this review since the first one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and I had to get a replacement.  Second one charged up fine, used it for almost three weeks before recharging.  I needed to replace my old Remington R845 which wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more so I wanted something with better battery life.  This one has the five minute quick charge and you can use it plugged in, two nice features.  I&#x27;ve been a Remington man since I changed to electric thirty years ago, Norelco&#x27;s are out of my price range and this was a very good price and used some AmEx reward points too.  After a week for my skin to adjust i would have to say that this is the best shave I have ever gotten with an electric razor!  Very easy on the skin, too, you can barely feel it cutting.  My only comment on the razor is that it is all plastic which makes it very light but not sure if that will hurt the durability.  In summation, a very good razor at a very good price.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday present for my husband.  He likes it very well...for the trimmer and for the way it shaves.  He&#x27;s also been impressed with the ability to run it under the faucet to clean out.  Definitely worth a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> You have to go over and over the same areas to get the job done. I haven&#x27;t used this for a long period of time and the blades are dull as can be. The ads talk about how exceptional the cutting blades are.......bull. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this razor, I&#x27;m going back to Norelco. It has never given me a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a replacement that was a few years old, same basic model. This is now a light weight piece of junk that seemed more like a fake kids toy. Spend a bit more and get the competitor brand. I did and it was excellent quality, unlike this.</li>
            <li> great shaver does the job it was made for very well</li>
            <li> Our son&#x27;s first electric razor. It&#x27;s definitely not as good as his dad&#x27;s $100 Norelco, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The Remington R5 rotary razor is average to above average, but not exceptional in performance, according to my husband.  He is, however, comparing it to a very high end razor which he has used for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says that while some of the components are high end (titanium coated blades) other parts are not as sturdy or well thought out.  It does not come with a charging dock, but plugs directly into the wall.  It also did not come with a cleaning brush, a little thing but one which is generally provided  The charging indicator is a single light which indicates that it is charging but not the percentage, or when it is charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He found the shave to be average, requiring more than one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I am a little surprised at this, as his experience is exactly opposite mine.  He likes his Panasonic better (but it is the top of their line) and while satisfied with the Remington, finds it just average.  I was less happy with my Panasonic (women&#x27;s) razor and was very happy when I could replace it with a Remington, which I&#x27;d happily used for years until the rechargable battery gave out.  I can say that the brand is very reliable, having happily used their products for years myself.  My husband, however, was less satisfied with this particular razor.  In terms of the shave, it was adequate, but little things detracted from it overall making it not as easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;He said he has to go over his face twice, but that was typical, with the exception of his high end foil razor.  The other issues were noted earlier: the lack of  charging dock, good charging indicator or cleaning brush.  He also said it was very plastic and was unsure of it&#x27;s water resistance.  Having recently replaced my Remington with a newer model of the same line, I am very happy, but it is a different razor and I can not argue with his differing experience.</li>
            <li> This is one razor that you cannot judge on first appearance.  I was happy to find it to replace my dying Norelco as it was a reasonable price point compared to others that do the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package I was REALLY disappointed, as it was incredibly light weight and &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34;.  It felt more like a child&#x27;s toy.  Really like a child&#x27;s toy pretend electric razor that a child can pretend to be Daddy shaving in the mirror.  I didn&#x27;t think it was going to do anything at all.  So I reluctantly plugged it in and charged it up for 24 hours like the instructions suggested.  The next day, with a good two days growth on my face I turned it on fully expecting it to fall to pieces under the overwhelming strength of my masculine chin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one smooth swipe it clear cut a path across my face that would make any standard blade razor proud!  It worked great!  I didn&#x27;t have to manipulate much to get a neat and clean shave despite the two days of growth I had established to test it out.  Even though it feels very dainty, this razor does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is incredibly easy, as the head snaps up with a push of a latch button, and you simply run the tap water over the face and insides of the razor body.  I then prop it up inside my medicine cabinet so that it can dry completely and it is ready for the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor holds a charge for two and half weeks of Monday-Friday shaving and charges up in a couple of hours, ready to go again.</li>
            <li> This works as good as a norelco . Clean up is easy when all you have to do is rinse it under water .</li>
            <li> Great shaver, great value!</li>
            <li> Sometimes the price of an item truly indicates the quality of an item. This rotary shaver is low-priced and also low quality. The build quality leaves a lot to be desired, and I found it a little painful to use. This unit tugged at my facial hair more than any other rotary shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. It was not a pleasurable experience. Pay a little more and get a better quality shaver.</li>
            <li> We bought this for a fifteen-year-old boy who is learning to shave. This fits the bill because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;* it&#x27;s rechargeable (the light shows when that&#x27;s needed)---and you can actually plug it in and keep going if the battery conks out&lt;br /&gt;* it glides smoothly&lt;br /&gt;* it&#x27;s not too noisy&lt;br /&gt;* it cuts well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The royal blue color is pretty slick, and the sides of the razor have grips. As we all know, teenagers tend to have sensitive skin, with acne, and he can use this without looking like he got in a fight with a knife. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Most reviews here are from experienced electric razor users.  I&#x27;m a newbie to electric razors, and maybe because my Chinese facial hair luckily matched with razor or maybe because of my electric razors inexperience, but I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 35+ years of buying the latest expensive manual razor blades, I&#x27;ve learned the errors of my ways.  I&#x27;m Asian and have coarse beard.  This shaver cut nearly as well as my manual blades, and it was accomplished in less than 1/5 the time and far easier.  And its trimmer blades fixed my sideburns just great too.  There are more expensive electric razors out there, and I&#x27;m uncertain as to this one&#x27;s performance over time, but I&#x27;m impressed so far, and see no need yet to purchase a more expensive one.  For a newbie, it does everything I reasonably want, at an acceptable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7-27-14 If you tend to let your facial hair grow long, use a trimmer before shaver.  Otherwise, the shaver will pull whiskers and sting a bit.</li>
            <li> I would say that this Remington Shaver is a above average shaver.  It does a good job of getting a close and even shave, but it does require going over the same areas more than once if you have very tough and course hairs.  I is gentle and easy to use.  The cordless feature is very convenient and lightens the weight and awkwardness of the whole unit.  However it does charge with a cord instead of a docking station like a lot of rechargeable units do.  That also hinders any knowledge of when the unit is fully charged.  However it does appear to hold a charge for a long time.  I haven&#x27;t timed it, so I can&#x27;t say how long.  It is very light weight and it almost feels flimsy although it is holding up well.  For the average user this is a good model for the cost.</li>
            <li> This review is feedback from my husband: On the plus side, this shaver is very light and the battery lasts longer than many shavers. It has a pivot head. It says it has titanium blades that stay sharper, longer. The problem is, it just doesn&#x27;t shave that well. I had to keep going over the same areas to get a good shave. The pivot head seemed to fight me rather than flowing easily. I started to think the blades must be plastic it was so ineffective (they aren&#x27;t, but that was my feeling).  In case it was just me, I left the shaver where one of my sons would grab it for a quick shave, in place of his usual one. Afterwards I asked him what he thought of it. He had the same feeling, that it just wasn&#x27;t as good as he was used to. Sorry Remington, this one needs to go.</li>
            <li> This is just OK, I would have given this 2.5 stars if that was an option. Hubby was looking for an electric shaver to use when we travel, so he doesn&#x27;t have to shlep his whole kit. While this does an OK job, it is nowhere close to the shave you get from using a blade cartridge with shaving cream. Also, the charge seems weak and does not really last. Will he use it for travel? Probably. But not for an every day shave.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with this shaver.  My husband constantly complains about his other shaver because of the noise in his ear when he shaves.  This is whisper quiet.  I can&#x27;t hear it in the next room when he&#x27;s shaving and his head doesn&#x27;t ring from the sound.  It is a satisfactory shave, plenty of oomph to do the job and easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Remington has always had decent, perfectly useable electric shavers, if not always built the sturdiest. This particular electric shaver seems to carry on the tradition of providing the user with a good shave, not a great shave, but one that is good enough. The housing feels a little plasticy and maybe a bit too much creak and flex, but it hasn&#x27;t managed to break yet. The shaver charges up fine and holds a charge good enough to get about five days to a week worth of shaves before needing recharged. The triple head design seems to be of the lift and cut style, so if you&#x27;re prone to ingrown hairs, this might not be the best shaver for you. If you aren&#x27;t used to this design, it might alarm you with the slight tugging feeling it gives while shaving.</li>
            <li> I was delighted with the performance of my new razor.  I&#x27;ll not hesitate to shop Amazon more often!  Deliver was within a few days, and the razor is beautiful and efficient.</li>
            <li> The shaver gets the job done.  It feels a little light/cheap for what you are using but if it works, then it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  The battery life is fantastic, my husband has only charged it once in 2 weeks and he uses it every other day.  No pulling or tugging the hair, it cuts it off neatly and painlessly.  No complaints here!</li>
            <li> I happily looked at the great looking shaver in the new box. Once opened, the box contained the shaver (ready to go) and the charging cable.  While I understand it made no mention on the box of a travel pouch, I certainly expected to find a cover for the shaver heads to at least protect them.  So on to the testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does hold a long charge. While it arrived with some form of a charge, I went ahead and fully charged it anyway.  I then ran it for an entire hour on the counter and that was a great sign of the amount of time I could get out of it.  I then recharged it slightly (per instructions) and did get the five minute shave time.  So the battery works great and as advertised.  I fully charged it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the cheaper feel of the case. While I am not against plastic, it just felt cheap for some reason as compared to another I have.  The shaver head opened fine and rinsed easy. The power button and the button for the pop up trimmer were a bit hard but it might be just due to how new it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave was definitely not as expected.  Felt harsher, left me redder on the face and I really hated the head on the darn thing.  I have another tri-blade electric shaver that I like a lot. So I was just hoping... and was disappointed.  The head had a built in wobble to supposedly make it easy to go around your chin and such.  I found it moved quickly to one side or the other. It did not move smoothly as it shifted around.  That drove me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to end the story, I will keep this as a spare and backup. But I actually had to go and use my everyday Norelco electric razor to finish the job. This one was irritating and was leaving stubble behind.  Sorry..</li>
            <li> Please with performance and delivery.</li>
            <li> Very noisy and does not seem to shave very well.  We will see how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I thought my husband would be excited to get this new razor, but he wasn&#x27;t.  Cosmetically, it looks virtually identical to his old razor, but he soon complained that the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; was unsatisfactory. He used it to trim and refine his goatee and said, \\&quot;It does a better job than I thought it would, but I can&#x27;t see myself using this for the long-term.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His big beef is the feel of the plastic handle (cheap) and the three heads that, despite having double titanium rings, don&#x27;t feel that solid or stable on his face, especially when he&#x27;s running it over his jawline and neck. His current one has a highly sensitive and flexible head that springs and subtly responds to the changes in surface. He thought the Remington was a disposable sample, not worthy of the $40 plus pricetag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer even lists its ability to be cleaned as a feature. \\&quot;So it&#x27;s easy to clean, big deal. I&#x27;d rather have a solid shaver that&#x27;s a little harder to clean than one that feels so flimsy it&#x27;ll break next week.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, its worst quality (the hollow plastic handle) makes it lightweight and best for travel. Unfortunately, he rarely if ever packs a whole razor for travel, preferring to pick up an even lighter, disposable hand razor from the hotel or CVS when we&#x27;re travelling (since TSA starting banning razors on carry-ons). However, for those who do, it&#x27;s good in that respect.  Also positive is that the battery, once charged, lasts a long time, again good for travel. He also liked how quickly it charged. Lastly, it is easy to clean - press a lever and the top pops up, making it easy to clean the razors underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, none of this impresses hubby enough for him to get rid of his old razor. \\&quot;I&#x27;d get it if it were much cheaper - say, $15 - but not for the price they&#x27;re asking.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor.  Husband is pretty picky about his razors, but this one fills the bill..</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because it popped up as an Amazon daily deal. I needed an additional shaver to take on trips and thought this would be a decent, lower quality shaver to use in a hurry, but this Remington shaver is of extremely poor quality. The shaver head is decent given the price range but too often pulls on hairs, leading to an uncomfortably painful shave.    The worst aspect of the shaver is the pop-up detail trimmer on the back. Horrible design. It is held up by a small piece of plastic that refuses to actually keep the trimmer open while shaving against the grain. It&#x27;s impossible to use the trimmer for anything but the lightest application, leaving you to use the main shaver head to painfully pull against longer hairs that are impossible to cut with the trimmer.    Honestly, there is no reason to buy this product, at whatever price.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing to a $120 razor, this does not yield as clean cut but it does provide a lot for the value.</li>
            <li> This is a straight-forward rotary shaver - inexpensive and lightweight, it&#x27;s a nice extra unit to toss in your carry-on for a quick touch-up before arrival at your destination. The on-off switch, however, is a push button rather than a slide-switch. Therefore it might get pushed by accident in your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three rotors move somewhat independently allowing the razor to flex along the contours of your face, but the edge of the shaver prevents any of the rotors from reaching some areas. For example, the area immediately under the nose is a real struggle to reach and I find myself switching back to my Braun to reach these areas. Ultimately, my Braun also shaves a bit closer than this Remington, though admittedly the Braun is much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges quickly and appears to last a reasonable time period but the rotor speed does not seem particularly fast. As a result, the unit occasionally tugs rather than cuts so there is sometimes some momentary discomfort. So overall, nice as a backup unit or travel razor, but I wouldn&#x27;t want this as my only shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver!</li>
            <li> This razor does not get that good, close shave that we&#x27;ve seen with other electric razors.  My husband doesn&#x27;t like it for that reason and that it is not meant to be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> I thought this was for women but the packing said men.  Decided this product can be used by either. Like the close shave and ease of use.</li>
            <li> great price and works as well as my expensive ($130+) nurelco.</li>
            <li> Works really good makes a nice close shave! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I returned it because it was a used razor. It contained the whiskers of another person. They need to come up with a better package to put the razors in so they can tell if the razor was used before someone returned it. People do not realize it takes about a week of electric razor use to get good results. They give up after one try. Razor blades makes the skin of the face rough and prevents getting a good result from an electric shaver. After a week of use the skin is smoother and you get a good shave from the electric shaver. So be patient when switching shaving methods.</li>
            <li> You only get what you pay for with unit.</li>
            <li> Shaving my husband&#x27;s face, this works okay, but for his mustache and goatee the trimmer does not edge well.</li>
            <li> Long battery life, can also work plugged in. Supposedly you can remove the cutter section and wash it under a faucet, but there is nothing in the instruction booklet on how to do this. It is lightweight and fits the hand well. I would however like it to shave a bit faster, along with instruction as to removing the shaving head. This is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> This is a perfectly serviceable rotary shaver, and for ladies&#x27; shaving such as legs, it did a quick and serviceable job, certainly better than the ladies&#x27; electric razor I ordinarily use. However, there is something that feels cheap and plasticky about the construction. It&#x27;s really at odds with the fact that these blades are supposed to be a longer-lasting, titanium version, because if the blades are going to last a long time, I&#x27;d like to feel that the construction overall is sturdy enough to where the rest of the product is going to last as long as the blades will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curious, I stole my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver, which looks almost identical except for being a different color. Even though the Norelco is over a year old and I&#x27;ve read that you are supposed to replace the shavers regularly, or at least some part of them, I have to say that the Norelco seemed to do an even better job, and the construction seemed a lot less flimsy on the surface. It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m being biased against this one based purely on looks, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to stand up to the Norelco line in terms of seeming as though it&#x27;s going to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband tried this shaver on his face, and even though he initially scoffed at it for being lightweight and seeming to be of poor construction than he was used to, he had to admit it did a perfectly fine job, just the same as his usual shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a reasonable choice in the shaving category, but I would wait until it has been out long enough to where reviewers can tell whether it truly lasts over time. If so, I would be able to recommend this shaver wholeheartedly. It certainly does a good job when first out-of-the-box, and I would give it a five star review were it not for my doubts about longevity.</li>
            <li> These items were all gifts. I have been told by all that they are pleased.</li>
            <li> Very quiet operation, a definite plus.  Add this to the fact that it offers a close shave, without pulling or pinching your skin, and you have a winner.  The charge holds for a long time, and it&#x27;s really easy to clean.  Granted, it has a lower price point, so you can&#x27;t expect the same ease of grip and comfort in holding that comes with higher end razors.  But given the fact that shaving is fast and easy, that&#x27;s something we can overlook.</li>
            <li> My husband tried out this shaver for a month and these are his comments:  The reason I like an electric shaver is to avoid shaving off the top of a raised mole on my face.  This one is really light weight and very quiet!  It weighed in at 5.75 oz.  The closeness of the shave is not bad, but isn’t as close as a disposable razor.  It doesn’t irritate the skin and the cutters don’t get hot.  Infrared temp gage said 90 degrees F.  The charge lasts a really long time (over an hour total run time).  Hopefully the titanium coated blades will last a long time too.  We will see.  Sideburn trimmer pops out of the back and works well.&lt;br /&gt;The head unit is easy to clean with running water, but the individual cutter wheels are easily dropped if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;For a super smooth shave, I do usually finish with a quick pass of a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;o Lithium battery is very light&lt;br /&gt;o Quiet&lt;br /&gt;o Titanium coated blades should last a long time&lt;br /&gt;o Quick charge: enough for 1 charge in 5 minutes or fully charged in 90 minutes.  Lasts for more than 60 minutes of run time!&lt;br /&gt;o LED light to signal low battery&lt;br /&gt;o Worldwide voltage for 240 volt and 120 volt&lt;br /&gt;o Washable head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;o It would be nice to have a small bottle of oil included to lubricate the cutters after washing&lt;br /&gt;o A cover for the business end of the shaver would be nice for packing in the suitcase&lt;br /&gt;Good Value for a shaver.</li>
            <li> this came with a dead battery, charged it for 24 hrs like it say&#x27;s put still no power. Stay away from this.</li>
            <li> I have this shaver now for 4 weeks. I like it so much better than the NORELCO I used before ($150 item). It gives a smooth shave and the battery gives long service with one charge. I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not a very close shave and its not built very sturdy. The razor head moves while using it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to charge this puppy in two weeks. the trimmer is slower than I was expecting. However, it does a decent job on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Thought about using it for manscaping. Then I realized it would have to be strictly for taking care of the boys, or else I would smell my junk without scratching with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Great lil electric shaver.  I am very surprised at the quality.  Will buy again if needed</li>
            <li> Bought it for 30$. In these months it has held up pretty well. Perhaps the only small downisde is it does not give a very close shave , but however , Remignton shavers tend to be very durable , they tend to last 10 years or more without a blade change , unlike Norelco shavers , which are excellent for about 6 months , but then their blades lose their edge. On this one a good trick is to use the detail trimmer to trim long hairs (or tough ones ) , and then finish the job with the razor heads.</li>
            <li> So great razor, best I have ever had!</li>
            <li> We have owned this razor since May 2014 and if I could return it, I would.  It is noisy and does not give a good shave.  I have had much closer shaves and I do not have a heavy beard.  If I go for more than a day without shaving...it is a painful experience since the razor really pulls.  It is a cheap product and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap.  Pulls hair, cuts some.  Lube your face before use.  Doesn&#x27;t glide well.</li>
            <li> I am pleased, good close shave.</li>
            <li> Works fine,thought it had some kind of indication of battery charge state,but does not.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is totally acceptable. It won&#x27;t compare with the high end shaved I typically use, but is very serviceable. Key features are the long-lasting and quick-charging lithium battery, washable but not waterproof build, and titanium edged blades. Though this appears to use the same replacement heads as cheaper shavers that don&#x27;t list titanium. Make what you will of that.</li>
            <li> received timely, was as pictured and described, shaves well, some skin irritation as I have used safety razor for 50+ yrs. now on blood thinner and must use this type of razor.  can  not comment on quality or durability for 6 months or more,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What idiot would add their picture to this message, and why would I care to see what others purchases?!!</li>
            <li> First the battery will not hold a charge only get half of shave then it&#x27;s goes dead  also the motor speed for the blades is slow even when plugged in to the wall contacted Amazon and replacement is on its way</li>
            <li> This thing does not rotate quickly...barely cuts even on full charge.  Left stubble...get a foil shaver instead.</li>
            <li> This is a great &#x27;entry level&#x27; electric razor. It does not have some of the bells and whistles of a top of the line model , but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;This continues the tri-head tradition of a lot of razors used nowadays and makes for a pretty nice shave. I like these on the road or in the car as they are quick and easy. The heads are easy to clean with warm water and soap if you like. I use a small moustache brush to clean out most of the debris and then just separate the pieces and drop them in a glass with a drop or two of Dawn and let them soak, then rinse and put them on a paper towel to dry. Use a little Shaver Saver in the spray can and it lubes them up nicely. A clean razor is a good razor. The lithium battery is great it will let you keep it in the car a couple of extra days without recharging. Overall not a bad little razor.</li>
            <li> So happy it&#x27;s here. Thank  you ,  Linda</li>
            <li> This razor is performing as I  had hoped.  Was surprised to see that it was made in China.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for this new razor. I bought it for my teenage son who is just starting to shave. great for that starter razor. doesn&#x27;t have a LED readout to find out about battery charge, but if you plug it in once a week you won&#x27;t really need that function. keep in mind the replacement head is going to cost $25.00 so that&#x27;s a hidden cost that needs to be recognized. reminds me of how printers are inexpensive but the ink will drive the cost up overtime!!!</li>
            <li> Good low cost shaver!</li>
            <li> Good price , arrived on time and in tact .</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave and I have I a heavy beard!</li>
            <li> No carrying pouch was provided with the product. I bought a similar Remington shaver before and it had a pouch and a brush to clean the shaver.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this, it is so light weight.</li>
            <li> my husband says it doesnt give him a smooth shave and it pulls his hair. hed rather use a normal razor.</li>
            <li> GREAT shaver so far,  using for about two weeks now,  been using remington shavers for a few years,  best one yet.</li>
            <li> Cheap product compared to Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure glad I bought this on a open box price,because it&#x27;s not worth the asking price new.It&#x27;s alright I guess I am spoiled by Norelco with a superior product.</li>
            <li> One of the better razors for under 50.00.Titanium blades and pivoting head make for a closer shave.Only complaint is no cover or plastic head protecter.Charged time is 60 min which is decent.Would recommend.Shop around to find for under 50.00.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not great for a close shave</li>
            <li> Wow, after just a few days it would no longer hold a charge for more than about 10 minutes.  Got a refund (which was quick and easy, THANKS).  Still need a new razor, will NOT be considering Remington.</li>
            <li> working fine, better with a few uses.  skin has to be clean and dry. not a heavy duty old Norelco, didn&#x27;t cost as much either, works well.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver for the money. My husband says it shaves close without any pulling.  After initial charge it has held the charge well and is still going after 8 or 10 shaves.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this Remington Products R5 Lithium Power Series Rotary Shaver . It is the best razor he has had in his entire lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;Good work Remington</li>
            <li> The razor pulls to hard on the whiskers. It feels as if the head is dull.</li>
            <li> my shaver arrived in excellent order and entirely met my expectations it shaves as goodas any electric shaver I have owned if not better rergards p.lynch</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver! Super easy to use and it does just what you need it to. Not too many bells and whistles, but who needs all ofnthat when you just need to shave. Very well constructed and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> I was excited to order the new REMINGTON PRODUCTS R5 LITHIUM POWER SERIES ROTARY SHAVER, for my husband. Though he’s had the same shaver for years - that still works - technology has changed. It’s a great color – my favorite (Yes, I’m a visual person, so that matters.) It’s lightweight (Not heavy like his older one.) and fits in your hand nicely. The cost is reasonable, and the brand reliable. It’s supper quite, a huge plus. The feature to shave sideburns is convenient. The fact that it is not attached to the cord after charging is a new and wonderful plus for my husband. As far as a close shave, it is comparable to his older shaver, which doesn’t compare to using a razor. All in all - as far as shavers go - a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Titanium-Coated Twin Track Blades - Two tracks of titanium-coated blades allow for both longevity and maximum skin contact.&lt;br /&gt;-PowerFlex 360 Degree - Allows the entire head to adjust to any angle on the face to help reduce irritation&lt;br /&gt;-Pop-up detail trimmer; Skin-friendly pop-up trimmer details sideburns and any facial hairstyle&lt;br /&gt;-Lithium Power - Using Remington&#x27;s powerful lithium battery, you&#x27;ll get 60 minutes of cordless runtime after only a 90-minute charge.&lt;br /&gt;-Washable Design - Keep your shaver fresh. It easily rinses clean under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington&#x27;s Lithium Power Series R5 Rotary Shaver is built for comfort, speed, precision, and, most importantly, high performance. It features PowerFlex 360 Degree Technology which allows the entire head to adjust to any angle on the face helping to reduce irritation. Its Precision Cut shaving heads with titanium-coated Twin Track blades smoothly cut long hair and stubble for an ultra close, comfortable shave every time. Beyond that, Remington&#x27;s lithium power system drives high energy and torque to deliver 60 minutes of cordless shaving per charge. And when you&#x27;re finished, it washes clean right under the faucet.ight under the faucet.</li>
            <li> This little guy works really well for the price. I&#x27;ve owned several over the years, some costing over $100, and this Remington works just as well. You do need to charge it for a pretty long time when you first get it. It&#x27;s easy to clean and does the job.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well, and the battery lasts the husband two to three weeks before needing recharging. It takes less time to recharge than others in the marketplace.</li>
            <li> This provides a good shave for me. It fits well in my hand, the razors heads flow smoothly across my face, and the unit holds a charge for a good length of time.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a smooth job of shaving, though it&#x27;s more rough to hold than the higher-end models. The handle is less comfortable than in the higher-end models. It&#x27;s flexible and adjustable, and has a decently-sized pop-up trimmer---interestingly bigger in size than the pop-up trimmer in one of the more expensive models. On the other hand, it&#x27;s less sleek and more simpler in design than those higher-end models, but its run time is the longest I have come across with these shavers so far--a whole sixty minutes. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s better than the older version of the same model.</li>
            <li> My first concern with this shave was that it is very lightweight and has a very plastic feel to it.  The fliptop feels like it could break if not handled carefully.  However, after using it for the last few weeks I&#x27;ve also noticed that it works very well, giving a good close shave that is as good as my more expensive shaver.  It&#x27;s quiet and charges quickly, and while not quite as comfortable as my Norelco, it does a good job.  It&#x27;s also much less expensive than the Norelco.  So, it seems like a good value for the price, but I&#x27;ll update later if necessary.</li>
            <li> Works great. Shaves close. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am replacing a 10 year old Remington that still shaves well but won&#x27;t hold a charge at all. All I can say is that in comparison, the new shaver is junk. There is no weight at all to balance the shaver, the blades feel like they are losing a tug of war with my whiskers with pretty painful results. I know products need to be made cheaply but this really pushes the limit.</li>
            <li> The rotary shaver works quietly and produces very smooth shave. I drop it one star as it is not compatible with my beard.It tends to grab longer hairs and pull on them. The foil type razor I use just slides over the beard and gets the short whiskers next to the it.</li>
            <li> My favorite electric razor was made by Wahl, but discontinued years ago and it is getting harder and harder to find replacement heads and foils for it. But finding another that can get as &amp;#34;Super Close&amp;#34; as that one has been hard. I should mention that my beard is weird. The hair is very fine and they lay flat as they emerge. If I let it grow all weekend, it is easy to shave off, but day-to-day shaving can be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of this Remington razor weren&#x27;t so good. It just &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; cheap. It is very light weight, in fact I would say too light. If there was a way, I would add a little weight to it. It is also very quiet. But how does it shave? Quite good actually. It did especially well when I used on my 3 day growth. No pulling, no pinching I almost didn&#x27;t feel a thing as it cut. But it doesn&#x27;t get close enough for my comfort. I still had to finish with a regular razor to touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not have a charging stand, the cord plugs into the razor and only a single LED for charge status, so no way to tell if fully charged or almost run down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good basic razor and I will definitely use it for 3+ day growth, but still not my perfect razor, so the quest continues.</li>
            <li> My husband only uses electric razors.  He&#x27;s been pretty happy with this one.  It gives him a close shave without much irritation.  I deducted a star because he says sometimes it feels like it loses a little power while he&#x27;s shaving.</li>
            <li> Works good&lt;br /&gt;good price</li>
            <li> gives a close shave, but the motor is slow.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write these things - I have been a Norelco guy for years. I bought this because Amazon had it on sale for 24 hrs for an unbeatable price. I was ready to order new blades for my Norelco and said, what the heck let me give this one a try. I needed a shave when the box arrived. Used it immediately out of the box without charging. I should have bought two. I can&#x27;t believe how closely it shaved ,in  some areas with just one pass. I was really  surprised. Great little machine.</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shaver. Not just a rechargeable set up. This is a Lithium rechargeable. Meaning the charge holds a lot long and stronger than typical rechargeable shavers. Like any old NI-Cad or Ni-mhd....those batteries take a charge and the instant you start using them they are losing strength. Lithium batteries take the charge and stay stronger a lot longer. Plus this shaver can be rinsed under water in the sink. So clean up is quicker and easier.</li>
            <li> OK for an electric.  I have never had an electric that does as good of a job as a blade.  This only for &#x27;emergencies&#x27;.</li>
            <li> For the price this shaver is very good..</li>
            <li> Good I used it every day</li>
    </ol>
