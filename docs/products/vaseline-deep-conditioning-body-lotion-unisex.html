            <li>To this day, this lotion is my favorite of everything I&#x27;ve tried across brands, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>This means that it sits on top of the skin to lock in moisture.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is appealing; it&#x27;s a lotion-cocoa smell as one would expect.  </li>

            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>Okay I am not a fan boy of lotion or Vaseline</li>
            <li>Thanks and happy shopping.</li>
            <li>it keep my skin moist and also leave a nice  smooth slim to your skin.</li>
            <li>I like the lotion for feet a bit more than the petroleum because it soaks in better and isn&#x27;t in a jar which easily contaminates from fingers.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious and does not leave my skin oily like many other lotions do.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, and it goes on and sinks into the skin easily.</li>
            <li>cause I tan, but it smells good, soaks in fast, not oily or anything, works great on my face, helps keep it not dry, and I like to put it on my face before I shave, with cocoa butter shaving cream, I recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li>Keeps my super dry skin feeling wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It feels very soft and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells wonderful, absorbs quickly, and has a nice consistency (not too watery or thick,</li>
            <li>It is not sticky, but silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>: This version is fairly cheap and I believe still available through the Amazon Add-on program.</li>
            <li>My skin is happy after I apply, simply put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it works for me so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the lotion smells good, is easy to open and apply and moisturizes</li>
            <li>The scent alone is what prompted me to try this lotion first, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is creamy but not thick, and spreads very easily.</li>
            <li>I have been using this particular for over 5 years now and it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and so healthy.  </li>
            <li>Has a soft nice fragrance not anything overpowering.</li>
            <li>So far, it has its own feel with a cocoa butter scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, if you be pregnant, this stuff will keep dem stretch marks in check.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and using it to minimize stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and I use it on on my belly to soothe the itchiness and to avoid stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite lotion to use.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite lotions ever.</li>
            <li>from 3 days ago, Hello It is right there......</li>
            <li>and my whole body is soft and velvety and smooth!</li>
            <li>Definitely for summer , even though most people would say this isn&#x27;t for summer.</li>
            <li>I love that they give you various sizing options of the lotion, from 3 to 32 ounces.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how it feels when it&#x27;s first applied -</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s finally absorbed my skin is very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vaseline makes pretty honorable products, so you know what you&#x27;re going to get.  </li>
            <li>We tried so many different things</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it actually moistures my skin.</li>
            <li>Takes good care of my dry, sensitive, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>it smell so good its not thick like other body lotion</li>
            <li>i am a very DRY person and this does it for me.. and the added cocoa butter is not bad either!!!</li>
            <li>The scent is like your typical cocoa butter, but it&#x27;s not too strong or too sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li>It works really well for me and my family&#x27;s skin type.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of Cocoa Butter Vaseline Jelly, so imagine my surprise when I discover Vaseline has a whole line of lotions, including their cocoa butter scent.</li>
            <li>lotion is very liquid-y (not something I&#x27;m a fan of).</li>
            <li>Product can packaged very well.</li>
            <li>B001I90NNQ Nivea Body Daily Lotion, Original Moisture, 13.5 fl oz (400 ml)</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.. greasy with a grease less after math...</li>
            <li>you want a lotion without petrolatum, I would highly recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Therefore, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PUMP VERSION</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended in pump version!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>on I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Sometimes at night I&#x27;ll put it on my feet with socks for soft sandal ready feet in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have never seen a bigger smile.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised to find my torso soft and my feet still moisturized well.</li>
            <li>But for the cold chappy skin weather, this is great.</li>
            <li>This is great for winters, because its slightly oily, so this is definitely not a good summer lotion.</li>
            <li>I bought this product before I switched to eco friendly products at the time the lotion did serve its purpose for a few hours I would have to reapply during the day I will not reorder this product</li>
            <li>It is not necessarily bad, but if it&#x27;s hot or humid, locking in moisture is not a good thing.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, sinks in quickly, and doesn&#x27;t grease up at all if you use one pump per each arm, each leg, torso, back, feet.</li>
            <li>It greases up on my hands if I use too much, and have to wait a few minutes for it to soak in completely if using too much on hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sorry I used/bought this product, but I will probably move on once the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>if anything, this leans more on the thin and watery side).</li>
            <li>It is a light scent that isn&#x27;t harsh, artificial, or overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for very dry skin because it just is not thick enough</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for very dry skin because it just is not thick enough</li>
            <li> Major dry skin problem is gone.</li>
            <li> Sweating is the process which cools the body down, and having a thin layer of petrolatum on top of your skin is going to falter that process.</li>
            <li> Half a pump is enough for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours later after going outside briefly</li>
            <li> The order is that of a slightly dulled down chocolate bar, not too potent, but not too weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about keeping my skin moisturized, and always need to have the most moisturizing skin products I can find.</li>
            <li> 10oZ lasts quite a long time as well</li>
            <li> I am now a believer of Vaseline CocoaRadiant Lotion and will continue to buy this item for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> my hands get extremely dry and like to crack in the winter/spring</li>
            <li> But then again their skin probably isn&#x27;t as dry as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular bottle is a flip cap, which is hard to open and close, and can be very messy.</li>
            <li> it was what I expected</li>
            <li> This cleared up my dry skin in about half a bottle.</li>
            <li> and of course she was extremely upset.</li>
            <li> A thick lather lotion that deeply conditions the skin that it encounters.</li>
            <li> Very faint scent and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> know how serious it is and how itchy it can be.</li>
            <li> I use it immediately after the shower and to touch up my hands after being in the cold.</li>

            <li> I love this lotion. Makes my skin feel very soft</li>
            <li> my hands get extremely dry and like to crack in the winter/spring so I decided to buy some lotion for them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get a name brand, let alone vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the lotion smells good, is easy to open and apply and moisturizes well. 10oZ lasts quite a long time as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about keeping my skin moisturized, and always need to have the most moisturizing skin products I can find. To this day, this lotion is my favorite of everything I&#x27;ve tried across brands, and the price can&#x27;t be beat. The smell is wonderful, and it goes on and sinks into the skin easily.</li>
            <li> Love this product...keeps skin moisturized!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful, absorbs quickly, and has a nice consistency (not too watery or thick, if anything, this leans more on the thin and watery side). In regard to the grease-factor, I would like to explain something. This lotion has petrolatum in it (the second ingredient). Petrolatum is in almost all Vaseline products (petrolatum is the same thing as petroleum jelly), and is a SKIN PROTECTANT. This means that it sits on top of the skin to lock in moisture. It is not necessarily bad, but if it&#x27;s hot or humid, locking in moisture is not a good thing. Sweating is the process which cools the body down, and having a thin layer of petrolatum on top of your skin is going to falter that process. Therefore, this lotion is a great cool weather lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a lotion without petrolatum, I would highly recommend [[ASIN:B001I90NNQ Nivea Body Daily Lotion, Original Moisture, 13.5 fl oz (400 ml) (Pack of 3)]] which I use as a spring/summer lotion. It smells like roses.</li>
            <li> This made my skin feel good. It didn&#x27;t suck the moisture out of my skin (yes lotions have done this to me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again. Definitely for summer , even though most people would say this isn&#x27;t for summer. But then again their skin probably isn&#x27;t as dry as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do what works for you!</li>
            <li> It works really well for me and my family&#x27;s skin type.  What a nice hearty lotion.  It is soothing. thanks</li>
            <li> Keeps my super dry skin feeling wonderful.  The scent is light and not overpowering. Sometimes at night I&#x27;ll put it on my feet with socks for soft sandal ready feet in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of Cocoa Butter Vaseline Jelly, so imagine my surprise when I discover Vaseline has a whole line of lotions, including their cocoa butter scent. It is a light scent that isn&#x27;t harsh, artificial, or overwhelming at all. The scent alone is what prompted me to try this lotion first, and I&#x27;m glad I did. The lotion itself is creamy but not thick, and spreads very easily. I use it immediately after the shower and to touch up my hands after being in the cold. It goes on smoothly, sinks in quickly, and doesn&#x27;t grease up at all if you use one pump per each arm, each leg, torso, back, feet. It greases up on my hands if I use too much, and have to wait a few minutes for it to soak in completely if using too much on hands. Half a pump is enough for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours later after going outside briefly and my whole body is soft and velvety and smooth! I&#x27;m very surprised to find my torso soft and my feet still moisturized well. I like the lotion for feet a bit more than the petroleum because it soaks in better and isn&#x27;t in a jar which easily contaminates from fingers. I am now a believer of Vaseline CocoaRadiant Lotion and will continue to buy this item for as long as I can. I love that they give you various sizing options of the lotion, from 3 to 32 ounces.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. It smells delicious and does not leave my skin oily like many other lotions do.</li>
            <li> Great product makes your skin feel so good. Has a soft nice fragrance not anything overpowering. I would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> A thick lather lotion that deeply conditions the skin that it encounters. So far, it has its own feel with a cocoa butter scent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product because it: smells great, feels great, moisturizes great. Takes good care of my dry, sensitive, itchy skin. Husband loves the way my skin feels when I use this product &amp; that&#x27;s a plus. Good price too!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin tone evening out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is very liquid-y (not something I&#x27;m a fan of). I don&#x27;t like how it feels when it&#x27;s first applied - it&#x27;s almost sticky.  Once it&#x27;s finally absorbed my skin is very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is appealing; it&#x27;s a lotion-cocoa smell as one would expect.  I&#x27;m not sorry I used/bought this product, but I will probably move on once the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lotion to use. It keeps you smelling good and moisturized for most of the day!</li>
            <li> I bought this product before I switched to eco friendly products at the time the lotion did serve its purpose for a few hours I would have to reapply during the day I will not reorder this product</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!  And smells great too!  Would recommend this to anyone.Can&#x27;t beat the value for the price of  this product.</li>
            <li> Delivered as described and in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Good product. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, it does not leave your skin feeling greasy, just clean. The order is that of a slightly dulled down chocolate bar, not too potent, but not too weak. The only problem is the bottle itself. This particular bottle is a flip cap, which is hard to open and close, and can be very messy. Therefore, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PUMP VERSION, it is cleaner, faster and easier to use! This cleared up my dry skin in about half a bottle. It smells great and should be used by and man, woman or child who want clean, fresh looking skin all the time! Highly Recommended in pump version!&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps :)&lt;br /&gt;Note: This version is fairly cheap and I believe still available through the Amazon Add-on program. SO if lack of pump, doesn&#x27;t bother you, buy this product as is!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it keeps my skin from getting ashy in da winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, if you be pregnant, this stuff will keep dem stretch marks in check.</li>
            <li> This is great for winters, because its slightly oily, so this is definitely not a good summer lotion. But for the cold chappy skin weather, this is great. Once a day after bath, keeps you hydrated throughout. I prefer the fragrance of the cucumber version though.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hands and feet. It feels very soft and it smells good too. I will buy again after later. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Product can packaged very well. The actually product I had used before and I love the way my skin feel after using it. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and using it to minimize stretch marks. Very faint scent and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is literally the only lotion I will use over and over again and will continue to always buy!  I have been using this particular for over 5 years now and it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and so healthy.  It smells amazing and isn&#x27;t too oily.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, smells good, and leaves my skin feeling radiant! This will come in handy for the winter. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I been looking for body lotion that smell like cocoa butter I found . it smell so good its not thick like other body lotion that&#x27;s a good thing. affordable price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, so is the travel bottle I can throw in my gym/tanning bag, can&#x27;t say I get a glow from it cause I tan, but it smells good, soaks in fast, not oily or anything, works great on my face, helps keep it not dry, and I like to put it on my face before I shave, with cocoa butter shaving cream, I recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> This lotion smells really nice and it spreads smoothly. I&#x27;m pregnant and I use it on on my belly to soothe the itchiness and to avoid stretch marks. Surprisingly it works for me so far. Almost 8 months and no stretch mark yet on my belly (knock on wood). Try it. Value for money &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.. greasy with a grease less after math... keeps my skin hydrated for hours.. i am a very DRY person and this does it for me.. and the added cocoa butter is not bad either!!!</li>
            <li> smells goo just received</li>
            <li> Smells nice, goes on easy - don&#x27;t have to rub it in for five mins. Moisturized OK. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for very dry skin because it just is not thick enough</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer after my showers.. on my legs, chest and arms.  The scent is like your typical cocoa butter, but it&#x27;s not too strong or too sweet smelling.  Vaseline makes pretty honorable products, so you know what you&#x27;re going to get.  My skin is happy after I apply, simply put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to buy as an add-on I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Okay I am not a fan boy of lotion or Vaseline but this product deserves a review. My wife has eczema and anyone that know about this condition know how serious it is and how itchy it can be. My wife before we knew what eczema was would scratch all the time while she slept and when awake. Scares everywhere and of course she was extremely upset. We tried so many different things but none of them worked. When we came to this affordable product within about a week her skin tone evened out noticeably and the scares started to fade. I have never seen a bigger smile. I would highly recommend this product. Your skin will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review helped you please let me know. Thanks and happy shopping.</li>
            <li> It is in Opa Locka FL. from 3 days ago, Hello It is right there......</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite lotions ever. My family has for the longest been customers of the Vaseline brand, and one day I saw this and decided to buy this, and I have not regetted it one bit. I love the fact that it actually moistures my skin. I have some lotions that after I put it on, it appears like I didn&#x27;t even apply anything. That is definitely not the case with this brand. It&#x27;s awesome, with a nice smell to boot.</li>
            <li> have been using vaseline for a while it keep my skin moist and also leave a nice  smooth slim to your skin.</li>
            <li> Major dry skin problem is gone. Feels and wears great when applied and I don&#x27;t notice any reside problems as some others lotions do have.</li>
