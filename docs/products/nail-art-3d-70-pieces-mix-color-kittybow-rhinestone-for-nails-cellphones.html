            <li>Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed</li>
            <li>These are so cute!  </li>
            <li>On closer emanation this turns out NOT to be as wonderful as I first though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>quality is nice...</li>
            <li>now I am not as happy with it as I was in my first review.</li>
            <li>Over all I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these hello kitty&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I apply them on with some nail glue and voila, they&#x27;re on for a week or more.</li>
            <li>cute, did what I thought it would</li>
            <li>the nail polish top coats and also acrylic does not make the colors bleed...perfect for grab bags with friends...</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use these for so many projects.</li>
            <li>most of the Hello Kittys arw damaged.</li>
            <li>I love these and when I got them</li>
            <li>i am completely satisfied withy purchase</li>
            <li>Unless the seller can fix this, I don&#x27;t think I will be buying any more of these.</li>
            <li>absolutely the most adorable 3-d nail art peices ever!!  </li>
            <li>it made it easy for me</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I think I can rectify that with enamel, a fine tipped paint brush and some patience.</li>
            <li>The bows look super cute on toes.</li>
            <li>The hello kitty were big for my nails, but the bows looks fit great.  </li>
            <li>these are fabulous for nails</li>
            <li>Love it, so much fun to add on</li>
            <li>anywhere we love, feels more little touch, gives warm feeling to the personality!</li>
            <li>They are way too large to put on nails of most people.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of fun playing around with ideas.</li>
            <li>Really worth it.  </li>
            <li>I would give it a 5 star because they took the exact amount of money for what this item cost</li>
            <li>cuz if they say they&#x27;re going to send you a certain amount you want to go &amp; check it ,well I did start counting</li>
            <li>I also recevied the order fast.</li>
            <li>light blue kitties with 5 light blue bows&lt;br</li>
            <li>5 purple kitties are a MUCH lighter shade then the 5 purple bows.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>light pink kitties with 5 light pink bows</li>
            <li>The paint on the dress left much to be desired.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t get the whole 70 of them I only got 60..</li>
            <li>As far as using them for nail art; they are not flexible so they do not lie flush to the nail</li>
            <li>Hot Pink kitties with no bows to go with them</li>

            <li> but they are a little too big, nothing major.</li>
            <li> but not if I&#x27;m only going to get half of them..</li>

            <li> my daughter purchased these for nail art and to decorate a cell phone case; they fell off the nail and they never stuck; glue mever dried on he silicone case.  </li>
            <li> Neon Green bows with no kitties to go with them</li>
            <li> Somewhat sad; I was looking forward to have Hello Kitty charms that were other than pink.</li>

            <li> And the was this one random purple flower in there... not sure about that one.</li>

            <li> Was just as described. You get a great mix of hello Kitty and bows in lots of colors and sizes.</li>
            <li> These are so cute!  Looking forward to using them in my craft projects.  My daughter and her friends just love Hello Kitty so these will go over great!</li>
            <li> I had a lot of fun playing around with ideas. The bows look super cute on toes. I also recevied the order fast.</li>
            <li> The hello kitty were big for my nails, but the bows looks fit great.  The hello kitty can be made into earrings, was why I didn&#x27;t mind.  Over all I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these hello kitty&#x27;s. I bought them for my nails specifically because they are 3d, meaning they are going to stand out. I apply them on with some nail glue and voila, they&#x27;re on for a week or more. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how I got black kitty&#x27;s but no black bows. Not a deal breaker because I can buy them separately. Thank you!</li>
            <li> cute, did what I thought it would</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
            <li> absolutely the most adorable 3-d nail art peices ever!!  these are fabulous for nails any size of nail would work with these....quality is nice...the nail polish top coats and also acrylic does not make the colors bleed...perfect for grab bags with friends...definitely will be buying these again.  :)</li>
            <li> way to big for nails they don&#x27;t sit well on your nails.  waist of money</li>
            <li> # of items in my package was not what I was told before buying it! there4 I will not recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> Love it, so much fun to add on anywhere we love, feels more little touch, gives warm feeling to the personality!</li>
            <li> Anything Hello Kitty is just wonderful, my daughter loves them. I&#x27;m going to use these for so many projects. Thank You!</li>
            <li> there are about 40 pieces. most of the Hello Kittys arw damaged. i did not get half the colors shown. extremely disappointed. would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Somewhat sad; I was looking forward to have Hello Kitty charms that were other than pink. Didn&#x27;t happen. The paint on the dress left much to be desired. Thankfully, I think I can rectify that with enamel, a fine tipped paint brush and some patience. And the was this one random purple flower in there... not sure about that one.</li>
            <li> I love these and when I got them yes I&#x27;m curious cuz if they say they&#x27;re going to send you a certain amount you want to go &amp; check it ,well I did start counting and I&#x27;m very disappointed because I only got 60 of themwhat happened to the other 10 I would buy them again but not if I&#x27;m only going to get half of them..&lt;br /&gt;otherwise I would give it a 5 star because they took the exact amount of money for what this item cost but I didn&#x27;t get the whole 70 of them I only got 60..</li>
            <li> all great but they are a little too big, nothing major. i could work with them. i am completely satisfied withy purchase</li>
            <li> These look and work as described.  They are great products for a great price.  Really worth it.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> my daughter purchased these for nail art and to decorate a cell phone case; they fell off the nail and they never stuck; glue mever dried on he silicone case.  As far as using them for nail art; they are not flexible so they do not lie flush to the nail hence water gets under it and it eventually falls off.</li>
            <li> will send you out a bag of mixed bows and about 10 hello kitty in the same color BEWARE</li>
            <li> On closer emanation this turns out NOT to be as wonderful as I first though.&lt;br /&gt;The good part.&lt;br /&gt;I did get 70 pieces.&lt;br /&gt;5 light pink kitties with 5 light pink bows&lt;br /&gt;5 light blue kitties with 5 light blue bows&lt;br /&gt;5 black kitties with 5 black bows&lt;br /&gt;*Now Here Is Where It Goes Bad*&lt;br /&gt;Got 5 red kitties BUT 3 out to the 5 red bows 3 have NO rhinestones in them&lt;br /&gt;The 5 purple kitties are a MUCH lighter shade then the 5 purple bows.&lt;br /&gt;I got bright&lt;br /&gt;5 Yellow kitties with no bows to go with them.&lt;br /&gt;5 Hot Pink kitties with no bows to go with them&lt;br /&gt;5 Neon Green bows with no kitties to go with them&lt;br /&gt;5 Bright Orange bows with no kitties to go with them&lt;br /&gt;So now I am not as happy with it as I was in my first review. Unless the seller can fix this, I don&#x27;t think I will be buying any more of these. Too bad because they are very pretty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any bows, luv my Hello Kitties</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected. They are way too large to put on nails of most people. I ended up placing them on Jewelry boxes as decorations.</li>
