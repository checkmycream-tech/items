            <li>is probably a good buy for you.</li>
            <li>Truly exceptional.</li>
            <li>I swim every day, so this is a really nice tool to have.</li>
            <li>This does a good job of getting rid of most of it.  </li>
            <li>So I used it and then used my own shampoo afterward.</li>
            <li>I have a very light haired child and her hair was beginning to look and feel like straw when I started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>It needs to be  made more thicker.</li>
            <li>so I wonder if my hair is more prone to holding the chlorine.</li>
            <li>Between this product and the leave in conditioner, my hair is doing much better.  </li>
            <li>Most people can&#x27;t find this shampoo in the stores.  </li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>The product is great, a five star product no doubt, one I&#x27;ve used before and really like.</li>
            <li>I chose this because the description said it eas ok to use on babies and children.</li>
            <li>The scent was ok.</li>
            <li>My son is on swim team and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I made sure to keep the UltraSwim conditioner on the directed 3 minutes and</li>
            <li>My hair is better than ever.</li>
            <li>I love it and</li>
            <li>A fantastic product!</li>
            <li>my hair is dry, brittle and feels like straw when I wash it, but this product is the BEST ...</li>
            <li>A swim cap and ear plugs make the swim remarkably more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It was so smooth and shiny and healthy looking without the pool smell.</li>
            <li>Upkeep is easy, works as described.  </li>
            <li>beforehand provides a helpful barrier for the skin and can be even more helpful than using lotion after, when you just want to be clean and not sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is like a sponge and once it&#x27;s full of water, it&#x27;s not going to absorb any more.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I have curly hair- and learned that instead of using shampoos like these, I can mix baking soda in my sulfate free shampoo to make a paste and rub that into my hair to get the chlorine out instead.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is just perfect for swimmers who get in the water everyday and need to wash off the chlorine.</li>
            <li>Good value, and shipped far quicker than I could have imagined</li>
            <li>I go to the pool a lot, which took a significant toll on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo - it works exactly as it says it does.  </li>
            <li>but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as clean.  </li>
            <li>Each time I wash my hair with UltraSwim, I make sure I really lather up and scrubb</li>
            <li>(soaking)my hair with cool water.  </li>
            <li>The price seemed right--wonderful, in fact--but the shipping charge from this particular vendor more than tripled the price of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Works great when you start using before the hair turn green.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth trying</li>
            <li>P.S. Goggles (preferably with some kind of anti-fog stuff) are essential (of course).  </li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, so I ended up adding it to my regular shampoo and was able to create the results I wanted (more lathering ability).</li>
            <li>Use your own conditioner to get your hair back to the soft feeling we all love.</li>
            <li>was ruining the color pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?</li>
            <li>Her hair is now full of shine and very manageable.</li>
            <li>and my hair is soft, it smells good, and it feels revived... after using it only once!</li>
            <li>Maybe a few more times and it will be better.</li>
            <li>My bright blonde 6 year old lives in the pool during the summer.</li>
            <li>The shampoo helps remove chlorine a little bit, but not enough to be able to write a good review.  </li>
            <li>At first, I would just wash my hair each time with Pantene for curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels smooth and soft after every wash no matter how often I swim.</li>
            <li>I used Ultraswim shampoo and then the conditioner for the first time today</li>
            <li>necessary for swimmers for sure</li>
            <li>This seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>sure enough, after my shower, I could tell that my hair felt</li>
            <li>I love this product, only thing is I can&#x27;t find it in the stores once summer is over ...</li>
            <li>I swim laps pretty often and my hair was getting course and damaged.</li>
            <li>We purchased this shampoo, and after just one use, I&#x27;m able to comb his hair easily, and he no longer wakes up with a giant rats&#x27; nest on the back of his head.</li>
            <li>I could tell that my hair didn&#x27;t feel as good as it had after using the UltraSwim shampoo combo (mixed with my regular shampoo) and the UltraSwim conditioner.</li>
            <li>this shampoo does exactly what it says i just wish it was alittle cheaper if then i would buy a whole bunch of it</li>
            <li>Takes out all of the chlorine and leaves his hair super soft.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference on my hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swimmer, definitely a shampoo to have.</li>
            <li>so my hair doesn&#x27;t absorb as much of the pool water.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>One of the things i did start to do (learned it on line)is before i get in the pool, i always make sure to wet</li>
            <li>Works really well cleaning out chlorine&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My daughter also has very tangly curls</li>
            <li>Really works without using much at a time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, UltraSwim is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>And then using conditioner after the UltraSwim really improves the hair&#x27;s texture.  </li>
            <li>I like to mix it with my regular sulfate free shampoo-to try and lessen the damage.</li>
            <li>Her hair was really taking a hit from the chlorine.  </li>
            <li>my hair is softer, shinier and much healther.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very prompt.</li>
            <li>my hair dresser really noticed the difference immediately.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY shampoo that removes all the chlorine to leave beautifully clean hair.  </li>
            <li>Between this shampoo and getting my hair wet before the pool I&#x27;ve been able to retain my hair color much better than previously.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the conditioner.</li>
            <li>highly recommended product must have if you are a swimmer then buy it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, I went to have my hair cut and mentioned to my stylist that I had begun swimming regularly in a highly treated pool.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended also is the Ultra Swim Conditioner.</li>
            <li>does not fade any faster than it normally would.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scents and additives in cosmetic and grooming products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to compare it other than your traditional shampoos and conditioners but this is far far better</li>
            <li>I use about a dollar size amount in my hair and do be careful because it is very runny in that it will spill right out of your hand.  </li>
            <li>Really makes their dry, summer, chlorine damaged much softer and healthier!</li>
            <li>I first started swimming seriously last summer about 5 days a week.</li>
            <li>At first, I had no problems using my regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Hair soft, chlorine smell gone, sticky coating is history!  </li>
            <li>This works really well for removing chlorine from hair, and left it feeling quite decent.</li>
            <li>It completely elimates the straw feeling from your chlorine saturated hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and I really like my regular conditioner</li>
            <li>It did not leave it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Very helpful to keep my girls long hair manageable and not straw like, even in summer when we spend a lot of days at the pool!</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use everyday and really gets the chlorine smell out.  </li>
            <li>Only complaint is that the shampoo comes out too quick out of the bottle.</li>

            <li> Hair soft, chlorine smell gone, sticky coating is history!  </li>
            <li> This works really well for removing chlorine from hair, and left it feeling quite decent.</li>
            <li> It completely elimates the straw feeling from your chlorine saturated hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and I really like my regular conditioner</li>
            <li> It did not leave it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Very helpful to keep my girls long hair manageable and not straw like, even in summer when we spend a lot of days at the pool!</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use everyday and really gets the chlorine smell out.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the shampoo comes out too quick out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The type that usually doesn&#x27;t have real complaints when it comes to chlorine.</li>
            <li> I have two daughters, with very long hair, who swim several days a week.  </li>
            <li> I swim several times a week, and before using this shampoo, my hair  was dry and often reeked of chlorine.  </li>
            <li> However, the people at xtreme closeouts were really helpful and sorted the issue by sending me the item again within few days!!</li>
            <li> After every wash my hair felt dry and brittle even with loads of conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and brittle from swimming.  </li>
            <li> Then I used the Ultra Swim Conditioner, which is a must because you have to put the nutrients back into your hair that it needs after stripping it down.</li>
            <li> Which maybe true, but wwhen I opened it at home, it had a artificial blueberry scent that instant gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I put a little of ultra-swim shampoo on my hair under my cap prior to swimming and then wash my hair after swimming.  </li>
            <li> Went back to conditioner, lemon juice and a little shampoo mix in a bowl let it sit on hair for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li> Also my hair dresser told me to get my hair wet before getting in the pool as hair</li>
            <li> With 3 blonde girls swimming 3-5 day per week their hair was turning green.</li>
            <li> My kid had been crying over having his (short) hair combed for months, when I realized it was the swim-lessons chlorine in his hair that was making it so unkempt and knotty.</li>
            <li> The appearance and texture of the shampoo is thin, but it really does the job.  </li>
            <li> The other reviews are spot on-I also this this shampoo as a body gel when showering after a pool work out.  </li>
            <li> One other thing I do to complement the product is to use the sister conditioner before and after the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I got some of this stuff the other day.</li>
            <li> Plus, once the hair is lathered, the suds work beneath the arms and in other nether regions (TMI?)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with chlorine remaining in my hair, nor does it change color due to the chlorine.  </li>
            <li> Even when my hair was wet!</li>
            <li> It is small enough so i can carry it everywhere and always have it in my backpack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well on getting the green out of blonde hair in just a few washes.  </li>
            <li> and while we&#x27;re at it, using conventional shampoo before the swim helps the swim cap (preferably silicone) stay in place.  </li>
            <li> we have hard well water that we treat with Chlorine, so our daily baths and showers are like going swimming ...</li>
            <li> I have long hair that goes past my shoulder blades.  </li>
            <li> I have dark hair</li>
            <li> What I mean is that I use the conditioner in my hair prior to getting in the pool and then when I shower after pool use</li>

            <li> Everyday after she would get out of the pool we would wash her hair with this product.</li>
            <li> I was under the assumption that if we removed the chlorine from her hair by using this product, it would in turn prevent her hair from turning green........</li>
            <li> It is so difficult to get chlorine out of thick hair and actually takes me a couple of days to finally not smell it.</li>
            <li> By using the shampoo after every swim, it has eliminated the green tinge my hair got from swimming.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because my daughters hair had green tint to it( swimming everyday) and it&#x27;s hard to get it out all the way.</li>
            <li> Then i add a small amount of leave in conditioner to my hair to help lock out the chlorine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s getting all the chlorine out</li>
            <li> I followed with my usually Biolage and conditioner.</li>

            <li> It strips your hair of all of the crap (which is something we should do anyway once in a while...but not too often or your hair will be crappy) and the chlorine is absolutely gone!</li>

            <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair. I first started swimming seriously last summer about 5 days a week. At first, I would just wash my hair each time with Pantene for curly hair. This simply wasn&#x27;t enough. After every wash my hair felt dry and brittle even with loads of conditioner. This was almost going to be a deal breaker with my swimming until I did some research and found this shampoo. Glad I found it. My hair feels smooth and soft after every wash no matter how often I swim. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I go to the pool a lot, which took a significant toll on my hair. This works really well for removing chlorine from hair, and left it feeling quite decent. The only problem is that it smells quite unpleasant. But if you use your regular conditioner afterwards, it remedies the situation. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I swim several times a week, and before using this shampoo, my hair  was dry and often reeked of chlorine.  This product is amazing at restoring the hair after a pool swim and does a great job at removing the chlorine.  I also highly recommend the conditioner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my stylist recommends soaking my hair in cold water before swimming so my hair doesn&#x27;t absorb as much of the pool water.</li>
            <li> I have two daughters, with very long hair, who swim several days a week.  This is the ONLY shampoo that removes all the chlorine to leave beautifully clean hair.  We don&#x27;t ever use anything else!!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Apparently chlorine has to chemically broken down, not just washed out with plain soap. UltraSwim does a great job of this.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works well. It does take out the chlorine smell out of my hair after I swim.  Only complaint is that the shampoo comes out too quick out of the bottle. It needs to be  made more thicker.</li>
            <li> The item that I had ordered got misplaced by the carrier. However, the people at xtreme closeouts were really helpful and sorted the issue by sending me the item again within few days!! Excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> I swim everyday at the gym and after reading all the reviews on this product, I decided to try it. I have been using it for a week. Each time I wash my hair with UltraSwim, I make sure I really lather up and scrubb and I wash two times. The chlorine still does not come out. My hair is really thick and long so I wonder if my hair is more prone to holding the chlorine. I think it is worth trying but I do not recommend this product for everyone. I did see results from using the Neutrogena anti-residue shampoo.</li>
            <li> I swim at the gym 3-4 times a week.  My hair was so damaged from the chlorine that i was afraid i would have to stop swimming.  Then i went on line and found this product.  It is gentle enough to use everyday and really gets the chlorine smell out.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and my hair is no longer brittle.  One of the things i did start to do (learned it on line)is before i get in the pool, i always make sure to wet (soaking)my hair with cool water.  Then i add a small amount of leave in conditioner to my hair to help lock out the chlorine some what.  Between this product and the leave in conditioner, my hair is doing much better.  And the color, (i color my hair for the grays) does not fade any faster than it normally would. Most people can&#x27;t find this shampoo in the stores.  I have only found it at CVS on the bottem shelf where no one can notice it.  The price is $5.75 or so.  They don&#x27;t seem to carry the conditioner though.</li>
            <li> o my goodness i love this shampoo does exactly what it says i just wish it was alittle cheaper if then i would buy a whole bunch of it and it smells soo good i love it!! highly recommended product must have if you are a swimmer then buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifeguard and swim instructor for the summer and I have to get in the pool twice a day and then sit in the sun for hours. My hair was dry and the chlorine smell was IMPOSSIBLE to get out! I used Ultraswim shampoo and then the conditioner for the first time today and my hair is soft, it smells good, and it feels revived... after using it only once! I highly recommend this stuff- it&#x27;s cheap, you can buy it at Walmart.com for even cheaper, and IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> The other reviews are spot on-I also this this shampoo as a body gel when showering after a pool work out.  It works great to get the chlorine smell out of my pores.</li>
            <li> If you have have color-treated hair, as it stripped some of the brown out of my hair, and left it life-less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s getting all the chlorine out but my hairstylist cannot tell I have been swimming 2-3 times a week in an indoor pool for 6 months.  I have long hair that goes past my shoulder blades.  I use about a dollar size amount in my hair and do be careful because it is very runny in that it will spill right out of your hand.  I think you get the best results the sooner you use it after being in chlorinated water.  I tried waiting until I got home but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as clean.  One other thing I do to complement the product is to use the sister conditioner before and after the shampoo.  What I mean is that I use the conditioner in my hair prior to getting in the pool and then when I shower after pool use I use the shampoo and then the conditioner.  I have the best results doing it this way.  I don&#x27;t have much to compare it other than your traditional shampoos and conditioners but this is far far better and the price is good too.</li>
            <li> Works really well cleaning out chlorine&#x27;s. Effects</li>
            <li> The product is great, a five star product no doubt, one I&#x27;ve used before and really like. The price seemed right--wonderful, in fact--but the shipping charge from this particular vendor more than tripled the price of the shampoo. I&#x27;ll buy the shampoo again--from another vendor.</li>
            <li> We bought this for use at the pool. It completely elimates the straw feeling from your chlorine saturated hair. My daughter also has very tangly curls and we use the products now daily!</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scents and additives in cosmetic and grooming products. I chose this because the description said it eas ok to use on babies and children. Which maybe true, but wwhen I opened it at home, it had a artificial blueberry scent that instant gave me a headache. I gave it to another friend who swims.</li>
            <li> Works great when you start using before the hair turn green. Upkeep is easy, works as described.  I gave it 4 stars because my daughters hair had green tint to it( swimming everyday) and it&#x27;s hard to get it out all the way. That&#x27;s why I mentioned using it before the problem occurs.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo - it works exactly as it says it does.  I swim laps and my hair, no matter what shampoo i used was starting to feel like straw.   I used this based on the recommendation of another lap swimmer and my hair feels like silk again!</li>
            <li> If you have swimmers in in your family this is a must get product during the peak swimming months. I have a very light haired child and her hair was beginning to look and feel like straw when I started using this shampoo. Her hair is now full of shine and very manageable. It also smells great!</li>
            <li> This shampoo does keep your hair from drying out from being in the chlorine pool water. Good value, and shipped far quicker than I could have imagined it would.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work to remove the chlorine from my hair.</li>
            <li> I got some of this stuff the other day. I must have a bad condition of Chlorine in my hair... Even the bottle says after just one wash and all your chlorine is gone. I&#x27;m at 2 washes and I still have lots of chlorine in my hair. The scent was ok. I followed with my usually Biolage and conditioner. Maybe a few more times and it will be better.</li>
            <li> Really works without using much at a time.  Plus, once the hair is lathered, the suds work beneath the arms and in other nether regions (TMI?) to diminish that excessive chlorine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and while we&#x27;re at it, using conventional shampoo before the swim helps the swim cap (preferably silicone) stay in place.  A swim cap and ear plugs make the swim remarkably more comfortable.  Also, applying lotion (not to your forehead or the swim cap will slip) beforehand provides a helpful barrier for the skin and can be even more helpful than using lotion after, when you just want to be clean and not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, UltraSwim is the real deal.  One lather and rinse does the job.  And then using conditioner after the UltraSwim really improves the hair&#x27;s texture.  P.S. Goggles (preferably with some kind of anti-fog stuff) are essential (of course).  And for even muscular development, try breathing on every third stroke so that you&#x27;re alternating sides.  And remember:  REEEACH!!</li>
            <li> Works well on getting the green out of blonde hair in just a few washes.  necessary for swimmers for sure</li>
            <li> Totally removes the chlorine from my hair. I swim every day, so this is a really nice tool to have. Truly exceptional.</li>
            <li> Necessity for swimmers!</li>
            <li> My son is on swim team and I love this product. Takes out all of the chlorine and leaves his hair super soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with chlorine remaining in my hair, nor does it change color due to the chlorine.  The shampoo also smells good.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT and works well. I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My bright blonde 6 year old lives in the pool during the summer. Everyday after she would get out of the pool we would wash her hair with this product. Unfortunately her hair still turned green? This product didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; tint out of her hair. I was under the assumption that if we removed the chlorine from her hair by using this product, it would in turn prevent her hair from turning green........no such luck.</li>
            <li> This is a amaing product . After my daugter hair become dull and loose shine after swimming . But this shampoo do a great job on my daughters hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo actually works! Very helpful to keep my girls long hair manageable and not straw like, even in summer when we spend a lot of days at the pool! Great find!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference using this.  The best thing I&#x27;ve found to remove the chlorine smell and build up is the &amp;#34;swim Spray&amp;#34;.  This shampoo smells funky too.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> the smell of the pool is gross.  This does a good job of getting rid of most of it.  I have a salt water pool so I dont know how it works with chlorine.  But yay for not smelling that nasty pool smell.  I use this product with the same brand conditioner.</li>
            <li> This seems to work pretty well.  I dye my hair and the chlorine from the pool was ruining the color pretty quickly.  Also my hair dresser told me to get my hair wet before getting in the pool as hair is like a sponge and once it&#x27;s full of water, it&#x27;s not going to absorb any more.  Between this shampoo and getting my hair wet before the pool I&#x27;ve been able to retain my hair color much better than previously.  But I still wish the YMCA would get salt water pools!</li>
            <li> Works well - takes out the chlorine smell. I like to mix it with my regular sulfate free shampoo-to try and lessen the damage. I have curly hair- and learned that instead of using shampoos like these, I can mix baking soda in my sulfate free shampoo to make a paste and rub that into my hair to get the chlorine out instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ultraswim for over 20 years and it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re a swimmer in chlorine.  I have dark hair so I only use it here and there but if you have toe headed children, this is a must have in the summers</li>
            <li> Looked all over but couldn&#x27;t find this stuff locally. With 3 blonde girls swimming 3-5 day per week their hair was turning green. this did the trick.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown, almost black hair. The type that usually doesn&#x27;t have real complaints when it comes to chlorine. That was before I started swimming in a hotel pool that LOADS their water with hydrogen peroxide (and it tastes like salt, too!). At first, I had no problems using my regular shampoo and conditioner. About a week into swimming every day - even with a cap - and my hair started feeling like straw. Absolutely horrible. I tried leaving my regular conditioner in longer and even left some on the ends after my shower in the hopes of helping things. Didn&#x27;t work. So I started browsing the web and came across UltraSwim. Thank goodness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased both the UltraSwim Chlorine-Removal Shampoo and the UltraSwim Conditioner. I was disappointed in how watered down both the shampoo and conditioner seemed (the reason for giving 4*s and not 5). The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, so I ended up adding it to my regular shampoo and was able to create the results I wanted (more lathering ability). I made sure to keep the UltraSwim conditioner on the directed 3 minutes and sure enough, after my shower, I could tell that my hair felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that the chlorine-removal properties of the UltraSwim shampoo were what I was experiencing and I really like my regular conditioner, so I stopped using the UltraSwim conditioner and went back to using my regular conditioner. The results were disappointing. I could tell that my hair didn&#x27;t feel as good as it had after using the UltraSwim shampoo combo (mixed with my regular shampoo) and the UltraSwim conditioner. I switched back to the UltraSwim conditioner and the results improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I went to have my hair cut and mentioned to my stylist that I had begun swimming regularly in a highly treated pool. She said she couldn&#x27;t tell. Even when my hair was wet! After another appointment 2 months later - my stylist still can&#x27;t feel any chlorine build-up. If you are at your wit&#x27;s end and just can&#x27;t take it anymore, this is probably a good buy for you. You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?this is probably a good buy for you. You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?</li>
            <li> My mom used this shampoo on my blond hair when I was a little girl to get the &amp;#34;chlorine green&amp;#34; out. Now I use it on my girls and it works just as well. Really makes their dry, summer, chlorine damaged much softer and healthier!</li>
            <li> It is so difficult to get chlorine out of thick hair and actually takes me a couple of days to finally not smell it. This shampoo is a wonderful invention. It strips your hair of all of the crap (which is something we should do anyway once in a while...but not too often or your hair will be crappy) and the chlorine is absolutely gone! I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the smell but what can you do? So I used it and then used my own shampoo afterward. Then I used the Ultra Swim Conditioner, which is a must because you have to put the nutrients back into your hair that it needs after stripping it down. It was so smooth and shiny and healthy looking without the pool smell. I recommend this to swimmers!</li>
            <li> My kid had been crying over having his (short) hair combed for months, when I realized it was the swim-lessons chlorine in his hair that was making it so unkempt and knotty. We purchased this shampoo, and after just one use, I&#x27;m able to comb his hair easily, and he no longer wakes up with a giant rats&#x27; nest on the back of his head. Hooray!</li>
            <li> The shampoo helps remove chlorine a little bit, but not enough to be able to write a good review.  And I still smell chlorine in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and brittle from swimming.  I put a little of ultra-swim shampoo on my hair under my cap prior to swimming and then wash my hair after swimming.  My hair is better than ever.</li>
            <li> By using the shampoo after every swim, it has eliminated the green tinge my hair got from swimming. Very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> The product did take the chlorine out of my hair. It did not leave it feeling soft. Even when I use the conditioner. Use your own conditioner to get your hair back to the soft feeling we all love.</li>
            <li> My daughter is on a swim team and swims several times a week.  Her hair was really taking a hit from the chlorine.  When she used regular shampoo, her hair still felt like it had a \\&quot;coating\\&quot; on it, not to mention she couldn&#x27;t get the smell of the chlorine out.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Desperate, I ordered a bottle of this shampoo and, voila, it works just like it says!  Hair soft, chlorine smell gone, sticky coating is history!  Highly recomended also is the Ultra Swim Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this product, only thing is I can&#x27;t find it in the stores once summer is over ... we have hard well water that we treat with Chlorine, so our daily baths and showers are like going swimming ... my hair is dry, brittle and feels like straw when I wash it, but this product is the BEST ... I love it and my hair is softer, shinier and much healther. I use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t alter my hair color with, seeing that I color my hair to cover the greys that I&#x27;m getting. I stand by this product ... that is why I am here to order it so I have it through the winter months as well. I also use the Ultra Swim conditioner with it ... both are great products.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a very good product.  Gets all the chlorine out including the smell.  I plan on buying this product again.  Is it sold in stores?</li>
            <li> I swim laps pretty often and my hair was getting course and damaged. This product seems to get the chlorine out without stripping it too bad. Shipping was very prompt.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just perfect for swimmers who get in the water everyday and need to wash off the chlorine. The cap closes well and never spills in my bag. It is small enough so i can carry it everywhere and always have it in my backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works best with the conditioner. It makes a huge difference on my hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swimmer, definitely a shampoo to have.</li>
            <li> The appearance and texture of the shampoo is thin, but it really does the job.  I use it immediately after every swim and my hair dresser really noticed the difference immediately.  She had recommended I use something to get the chlorine put of my hair, especially since my hair is color treated.  I also use the same brand conditioner after each swim.</li>
            <li> You need this product if you plan on swimming in Chlorine.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product! I&#x27;ve recently begun swimming 3-5 days per week and the cholorine was killing my hair - my regular shampoo couldn&#x27;t seem to handle it. This has been a &amp;#34;lifesaver&amp;#34; (aquatic pun intended).</li>
            <li> Never saw much difference in the green hair.  Went back to conditioner, lemon juice and a little shampoo mix in a bowl let it sit on hair for about 15 minutes and Voilla works like a charm.</li>
