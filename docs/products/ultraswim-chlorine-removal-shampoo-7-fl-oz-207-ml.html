            <li>With Ultra Swim it takes all the smell away, I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>A+, I&#x27;m glad I bought the four pack!</li>
            <li>Good price and shipped very quickly!  </li>
            <li>The results are amazing.</li>
            <li>make sure to wash my hair immediately after leaving the pool and use a generous amount of the shampoo so as to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li>This product is good, the hair feels Ok after using the shampoo and the chlorine odor is gone.</li>
            <li>I did some research and decided that the grapeseed oil I was using in her hair was probably having some kind of reaction with the chlorine.  </li>
            <li>My hair also has a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>The ash-color was gone, and a warm tone was revealed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Conditioner is kind of watery, so I apply a lot.</li>
            <li>Shampoo is ok, but does not leave hair feeling as good as others I have used.</li>
            <li>It seems to be popular at the pool, everyone else has it too.</li>
            <li>Or maybe it is just because the product is so diluted that it isn&#x27;t as effective?  </li>
            <li>I was mostly concerned, though, with ridding my hair of the damaging chlorine since I swim five days a week and Ultra-Swim seems effective.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is so effective that every time I go to my hair stylist he compliments me on how healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 years with great success.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M FEEL VERY FINE MY HAIR WITH THIS SHAMPOO</li>
            <li>At this price for this quantity, it is a very good deal, particularly with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>Although a \\&quot;thin\\&quot; shampoo, it creates a rich lather and does a good job of getting rid of the chlorine.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no other alternative to this product and it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li>I experienced my first problem with amazon after 100 orders.  </li>
            <li>Now it looks like I have very lightly frosted tips.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and it always works wonderful and leaves my hair feeling nice.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used it and am pleased!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very good smell and leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Love Ultra Swim  shampoo.</li>
            <li>They say there is no chlorine damage and when they touch my hair, they cannot believe how healthy it feels (note--</li>
            <li>I finish my shampooing with my favorite brand of volume shampoo.  </li>
            <li>By finishing with my favorite volume shampoo, I&#x27;m sure the chlorine is out</li>
            <li>I love this product and will recommend this to my friends who love swiming.</li>
            <li>It says on the bottle that it is safe for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I like this product and along with the ULTRA conditioner my hair has more body and manageability.</li>
            <li>I made sure to keep the UltraSwim conditioner on the directed 3 minutes and</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Try with the conditioner for even better results.</li>
            <li>My go-to shampoo for healthy hair in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I have bought three and will buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought and re-bought this shampoo many times on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Glad there is a way to get it because it is a must for summer.</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems to wash off the chlorine well, but I have to make sure to work it through her hair well.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many types of shampoo.</li>
            <li>It was UltraSwim, and I found it worked much better for swimmers like me.</li>
            <li>This is a truly worthwhile product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The amount of time I &amp; my hair spend in the chlorinated pool would surely have turned my hair into shining silvery straw if it weren&#x27;t for Ultra Swim Shampoo.</li>
            <li>well it is ok, it does the job, but not for every day use.</li>
            <li>I swim often and was hoping this product would keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>but this is ok.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>.. love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to buy them some more.  </li>
            <li>help hair stay healthy even with swimming for 3+ hours a day</li>
            <li>I used the Ultraswim Shampoo and Conditioner religiously after every practice and my hair stayed in perfect condition.   </li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell Three seemed to be better.</li>
            <li>Really keeps your hair in great condition during pool season.</li>
            <li>so I knew it would be ok.  </li>
            <li>Most will want to use a conditioner for that reason.</li>
            <li>This is one of our favorite staple products.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I have been using this product after I swim at the pool for many years.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for kids in swimming team and they love it.</li>
            <li>My daughter swam for a summer in camp two times a week and ever since her hair has been more like a doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know and can&#x27;t day for sure</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>Even better when combined with Ultra Swim Conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I have more money in my wallet.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser saw the difference as well and was impressed with the results especially since it was not a \\&quot;salon\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>After the first wash, I noticed a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li>It conditions better on my three children ages 7, 11, and 14.  </li>
            <li>and I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many swim caps with no luck.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and the fact that you get 4 at a time.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I shampoo with UltraSwim right after swimming to get all the chlorine out, follow it up with a good conditioner (Hair Rules), and if I want to do a treatment, I do a hair mayonnaise treatment.  </li>
            <li>It was always so soft and beautiful and the chemicals changed it.</li>
            <li>best shampoo i have found to remove chlorine from my children&#x27;s hair after long summer days swimming.</li>
            <li>It washes out the chlorine pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have fine and very light colored hair</li>
            <li>What makes a great company isn&#x27;t when you buy a product and are happy with it, few can screw that up.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem the best for scalp cleaning though, so sometimes I use a different shampoo when I&#x27;ve not swam to clean my scalp better.</li>
            <li>and they both make your hair smell good and nice and soft</li>
            <li>Also like that you can get squeaky clean hair without using a lot of the product!</li>
            <li>The most important thing you can do to help your hair is shower before you get in.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I don&#x27;t have any green-haired children this summer.</li>
            <li>Of course, finding a pool and using it is more important.</li>
            <li>far as smell goes, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li>, I really don&#x27;t think I would look good in &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Contrary to other reviews here, we have not been impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>It prevents drying and other hair damage perfectly.</li>
            <li>She swims daily so this is a great product to remove the chlorine build up and keep her hair shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Thus, Ultraswim shampoo comes very quickly out of these bottles.</li>
            <li>It would literally take an hour to comb it out with a fine tooth comb.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to be doing a fine job of removing chlorine.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant perfume and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in the condition of their hair.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is a FANTASTIC product.</li>
            <li>It can be a bit pricy so buy the four pack at 4 dollars each with free shipping or look for it on sale in retail locations.</li>
            <li>if you get in a chlorine filled pool, you need this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This was a present for my granddaughter, her mom thinks this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I will say my daughters hair is smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my hair, effectively removes the chlorine, and doesn&#x27;t leave it \\&quot;flat\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Got a great deal on the 4-pack, way cheaper than buying individual bottles at a store.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say this shampoo has restored my hair to 85% of its former self.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo for regular swimmers</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this after swimming in the pool, so it&#x27;s important that we have it available to get out the cholrine.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo not only for swimmers.</li>
            <li>shampoo does a very good job at removing chlorine as well as other minerals that can damage hair.</li>
            <li>(I do NOT recommend the UltraSwim Conditioner---use your favorite brand instead, as long as it&#x27;s a good quality brand---see my review of the UltraSwim conditioner for details).  </li>
            <li>but it seems that using the UltraSwim product has made a significant difference for her.</li>
            <li>but this does a good job in general.  </li>
            <li>Buying the 4- pack is really worth it!</li>
            <li>Anyone who spends a great deal of time in water like I do, knows that keeping her hair in good shape is tough when you need to find hair care products that will remove chlorine from your locks.    </li>
            <li>I swim 3 times a week in a pool that uses chlorine as well as a saline solution to clean the water.</li>
            <li>I bought this item to clean my bathing suit and skirt.  </li>
            <li>Then I clean both items with some of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The smell is clean, and beats smelling the chlorine on her any day.  </li>
            <li>We clean our hair with it and we clean our suits with it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair really clean with no hint of chlorine or choline smell.  </li>
            <li>In addition to removing pool chlorine, it leaves hair clean and silky.</li>
            <li>Great for dry hair and works like a charm on chlorine.</li>
            <li>While traditional clarifying shampoos are good and provide constant results, Ultra Swim is the best because it is specifically formulated to remove and strip the chlorine from the hair ends and restore hair to it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what we would do without it and the price is right!</li>
            <li>It seems to work ok, but you really have to vigorously shampoo the hair, and maybe even do it twice to get all the chlorine out.</li>
            <li>It is gentle to my hair and seems to take most of the chlorine out.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair sweet smelling and shiny.</li>
            <li>but I can say that as a (almost) daily swimmer, my hair stays in good condition and the gray doesn&#x27;t have a greenish cast as some blonds and grays take on....</li>
            <li>I use the Ultra Swim condition in addition on my hair only and it does seem to do a fairly good job of conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy this products cause it has such good reviews on it.</li>
            <li>In combination with the conditioner, it helps keep your hair from during green and brittle and it smells good too!</li>
            <li>works great to keep the damage minimal!</li>
            <li>Hey, what do I know, I am bold and gray.</li>
            <li>Sells out in stores quickly.</li>
            <li>and it helps my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li>I had tried high quality shampoos and conditioners, but this product is actually better.  </li>
            <li>We use just a little bit of the UltraSwim in the shower per instructions after swimming and it neutralizes the chlorine in our hair leaving it soft and healthy; and it smells nice, not perfumed but clean and nice.</li>
            <li>Better to use it in conjunction with your normal shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t do a lot for frizz/fine hair/volume/etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Along the lines of using more - it doesn&#x27;t foam up like normal shampoo</li>
            <li>I have naturally blond hair which is also very fine and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>As a new swimmer, I will continue to use this product, but I have to find something more...    </li>
            <li>Does leave your hair dry and brittle, so a good backup shampoo/condititoner is in order.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works, smells nice and does not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong on chlorine, but it&#x27;s also gentle, so I never have a flake.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly not because I have great hair---it&#x27;s all thanks to the UltraSwim Shampoo!</li>
            <li>where my daughter&#x27;s hair turned into a sticky tangled mess despite taking great care of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the UltraSwim conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize her hair enough, but definitely love the shampoo!</li>
            <li>I have tried several brands of chlorine removal shampoos and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>Very good for swimmers as well as other people who use normal mineral water.</li>
            <li>This is a great value and prevents kids hair from turning green and unmanagable.  </li>
            <li>With light-haired grandchildren, this works great to keep the chlorine green and straw</li>
            <li>I tried vinegar, rubbing a fresh lemon over my body, everything.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, so I ended up adding it to my regular shampoo and was able to create the results I wanted (more lathering ability).</li>
            <li>The Ultra Swim doesn&#x27;t get all the chlorine but leaves my hair fairly moisturized during the week and on Sundays the Paul Mitchell shampoo gets the rest of the buildup, and the deep conditioner really replenishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>4 bottles is well worth it for a summer child.  </li>
            <li>Ultra Swim is a product that swimmers know is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Combining it with the conditioner make it so much more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>So worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Love how it take the chlorine ickies out and leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>the only kind that gets out the chlorine</li>
            <li>It also is economical in use.</li>
            <li>Because of last two concerns, you end up going through the bottles faster - so not cost effective</li>
            <li>I have white hair and it strips the pollution that yellows it and adds a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase IMO.</li>
            <li>It is a nice enough shampoo</li>
            <li>The price was pretty god so not a bad value but having the time to wash twice is a pain.</li>
            <li>We have tried other shampoos, nothing works better, nothing smells better.</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo in the shower right after I come out of the pool.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?</li>
            <li>However, the conditioner restores everything right as rain.</li>
            <li>As soon as I squirt it into my cupped hand, it runs right trough my fingers.  </li>
            <li>Works well and delivery was right on time</li>
            <li>I use it right after swimming, and I don&#x27;t pre-condition, too much work!</li>
            <li>Hair feels super soft and smells grea!!!  </li>
            <li>bought for friend she likes very much</li>
            <li>I expected more clean hair than what it does.</li>
            <li>Great product hard to find else where.  </li>
            <li>sure enough, after my shower, I could tell that my hair felt</li>
            <li>ive been swimming consistently 3-5 times a week for close to 10 years.</li>
            <li>In order to keep my hair soft and damage free I follow with a concentrated conditioner.</li>
            <li>The fragrance when smelled in the bottle is pretty, but produces a 10 foot cloud around my daughter after she uses it.  </li>
            <li>I train in the pool several times a week and needed something better to wash out the chlorine...</li>
            <li>If anyone has a cure-all I&#x27;d be interested in hearing about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Avid swimmer, and this works well to get the closing dryness etc from hair.  </li>
            <li>I will try another brand next time to try for a better product.</li>
            <li>This works better than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The price here is a bit cheaper than when I bought my first bottle at Walgreens to try it out.  </li>
            <li>- so chlorine removal is an absolute MUST!  </li>
            <li>I prefer to use UltraSwim first to shampoo my hair thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>This stuff actually has a safe chemical in it that neutralizes chlorine.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>What else can I say about shampoo that&#x27;s specialized for swimmers except that it&#x27;s swimmer endorsed... by my swimmer ;-)</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo first to strip the bromine out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the next day service, Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon!</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 is I just can&#x27;t say I &#x27;love&#x27; my shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>The price was better than at the local drugstore</li>
            <li>* Need to use more (than regular shampoo) to get results</li>
            <li>It does not appear too harsh for my hair, which has stayed in good shape.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is that it is quite a bit cheaper than some of the other brands.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and clean...</li>
            <li>You need to be sure to use enough to get it to lather on your head and really activate (one review mentioned it doesn&#x27;t lather</li>
            <li>I could tell that my hair didn&#x27;t feel as good as it had after using the UltraSwim shampoo combo (mixed with my regular shampoo) and the UltraSwim conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only shampoo that keeps my sons hair looking good after daily swim practice.  </li>
            <li>I swim, have a super sensitive scalp so can&#x27;t use conditioner and have baby fine super straight processed blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I would just suggest that for medium to long hair it is used twice to ensure a better result.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo when I my hair was relaxed, while it was transitioning and still use it as a full natural.</li>
            <li>Left my hair smelling fresh and clean instead of like chlorine.</li>
            <li>I started using this shampoo after every swim and not only did we all keep our hair in great shape, but my oldest daughters hair is actually going back to its original soft sweetness!!</li>
            <li>this year swim team practice but a lot of more strain on the hair but with help of UltraSwim shampoo and Dove intensive care conditioner by kids blond locks were admired rather than dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>Unlike some sulfur-containing shampoos, this one smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to swimmers!</li>
            <li>As a regular swimmer, it is important to get the chlorine out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried this for a week straight and nothing happened.</li>
            <li>also, i happen to really like the scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>That product always worked well for me but as a clarifying shampoo it can be very harsh/drying on my hair.</li>
            <li>They can use it every day as it is gentle on their hair.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product if you have a swimmer.</li>
            <li>The wife really likes this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Your hair will feel very stripped otherwise.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been in swim lessons once a week now for over a year, and the smell of chlorine was really building up in her hair.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived in a timely fashion at a reasonable price, but does not work as well as promised.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo as a chlorine remover.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is so much healthier with this shampoo</li>
            <li>Now i need to use it at first then use my normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>If I stay in the pool any length of time, my hair turns very brittle</li>
            <li>Wish it were available year-round at places like Walmart, pharmacies, anywhere LOCAL.</li>
            <li>I would shampoo really well</li>
            <li>Her hair was getting very brassy and damaged by the chlorine...</li>
            <li>Seems to work really well for getting chlorine out of hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li>My daughter swims on a team and her hair gets very chlorine saturated.  </li>
            <li>How do you ever know if a product really works?  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really does take the chlorine out.  </li>
            <li>I was really struggling with my hair.  </li>
            <li>One wash after swimming and the chlorine is really gone.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Really like the scent afterwards - and no hint of chlorine.  </li>
            <li>Together, they really help limit some of the damage done by the chlorine.</li>
            <li>It really gets rid of the chlorine smell from my hair and body (didn&#x27;t do anything to help the suit).  </li>
            <li>Maybe because I&#x27;ve got really curly hair</li>
            <li>, I find this stuff really liquid.  </li>
            <li>I use this everyday and it&#x27;s extremely effective at preventing damage.</li>
            <li>Easy fix is to show the older ones and apply it to my younger one.  </li>
            <li>One other note, I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and find I can use only about 1 in 10 hair products because most smell too strongly for me.  </li>
            <li>One of the other swimmers told me she used an Aveda detox-shampoo product that worked better without the chemical smell.</li>
            <li>It is long and was really getting damaged by frequent swims, but is healthy again.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried many other swim shampoos</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s at about 90% back to its original shape fromTWO years ago.</li>
            <li>We have had an Endless Pool for many years, my wife and I swim three days a week.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected!</li>
            <li>Chlorine, particularly in indoor pools, can be very concentrated.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I swim at the local YMCA regularly and I&#x27;m convinced they use pure Clorox because that pool has so much chlorine in there</li>
            <li>Also if you need a special shampoo for your hair you will still need to use it as this product ONLY REMOVES THE CHLORINE FROM YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a shampoo out there that can completely remove 100% of the chlorine from your hair when you swim ever day, but for the $, this stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I now alternate Ultra-Swim with other shampoos and use a different conditioner as theirs isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Love slight flavor of the shampoo  </li>
            <li>Left my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I would recommend lathering up with the shampoo particularly on the crown and the tips for maximum results.  </li>
            <li>It took only three or four uses to rid my greenish hair of a whole summer&#x27;s worth of chlorine.  </li>
            <li>This really does work and gets the chlorine right out of your hair and gets it back on track.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, I went to have my hair cut and mentioned to my stylist that I had begun swimming regularly in a highly treated pool.</li>
            <li>ive tried ever high end</li>
            <li>My background in swimming comes from competitively swimming in high school and college about 8x a week, for 90 minutes during every swim.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, along with the Ultra Swim conditioner (see my longer evaluation there).</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone swimming.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I use it, but I&#x27;m not really sure if the chorine has been removed or it&#x27;s just masked by the very strong fragrance the shampoo has.  </li>
            <li>i wish it had pump action rather than tilting cap - sometimes shampoo comes out too much.</li>
            <li>What makes a great company is how the react when something goes wrong.  </li>
            <li>Plus this shampoo is so cheap, I hardly expected this miracle from it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason we&#x27;ve been willing to go the extra mile, so to speak, is because this product really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using UltraSwim chlorine-removal shampoo for a few months now and just purchased more because it seems like it works.  </li>
            <li>I shower with it after my swim and my hair feels fairly normal for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>My tap water is normal, municipally-chlorinated water.</li>
            <li>After using Ultra-Swim for a short time, I (and others) noticed copper and golden highlights in my hair.</li>
            <li>It seems to be gentler than the normal drugstore shampoo I had been using on her.  </li>
            <li>It lays on the water as a gas and can actually cause reactions by being absorbed through the skin.  </li>
            <li>Leave no funky odor, just soft/normal hair when I use this and then use my normal conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Follow it with a good conditioner and while your hair may lighten in the sun, it won&#x27;t get green and dry.  </li>
            <li>This is our new swimming staple.  </li>
            <li>really think ths shampoo is meant for kids or young people who have a lot of natural oils in their hair.</li>
            <li>While conditioner is a must afterwards, this product makes a great shampoo and body wash, and left no discernible smell behind after over an hour in the pool.</li>
            <li>My two sons swim several times per week and their hair was becoming really dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>This product will keep your hair from becoming dry and brittle and should be used by anyone who swims in a chlorinated pool on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Usually just shampoo once and quick at that, and rarely do I have chlorine smell to hair.  </li>
            <li>but I believe that this product did just as good a job in keeping my hair black and soft as any other swim shampoo for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been purchasing Ultra Swim from a local store for a number of years, but unfortunately it&#x27;s only available at the one store that&#x27;s far from home.</li>
            <li>At first, I had no problems using my regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This shampoo removed it on first use and I will use it regularly.</li>
            <li>I purchase this pretty regularly.</li>
            <li>After shampooing with Ultra-Swim, I smooth the suds down my neck, chest, shoulders and and let the rinse water take it to parts south.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell, just a little too intense.</li>
            <li>Still not exactly the same as if I didn&#x27;t swim but far, far better.</li>
            <li>We have very fine hair and even though mine doesn&#x27;t turn green (just my 2 blonde girls), it would feel like straw.</li>
            <li>Then I follow-up with my regular moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, ending with a small amount of a leave-in good conditioner which helps protect my hair for the next swim.  </li>
            <li>We live in Southern California and the kids seem to spend the whole summer in pools and Chlorine .  </li>
            <li>My hair never looks dry - it is always shiny and healthy - and I am not a young person!!!  </li>
            <li>I am hoping to find the extra large bottle if there is any.</li>
            <li>Your hair will soak up the clean water and have less room for chlorine.</li>
            <li>That helped clear the smell out of the skirt.  </li>
            <li>For many years I just experimented with different shampoos and conditioners to take care of my short blonde &#x27;do and cut it short again in the fall.</li>
            <li>It not only gets out the chlorine smell but really conditions my hair adding body and decreasing the dryig effects of chlorine.</li>
            <li>I am using this shampoo on my 9yr old and 5yr old.</li>
            <li>and I really like my regular conditioner</li>
            <li>, she does still use her old conditioner</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>I have my hair professionally colored every 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>x 3 months of summer +3 bottles of Ultra swim shampoo &#x3D; thankfully soft manageable great-smelling hair all around.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, naturally blond hair</li>
            <li>I put about a teaspoon of olive oil in my hair using a soft bristled brush to distribute it.</li>
            <li>My daughter spends over 40 hours a week in the pool - this shampoo keeps her hair soft and manageable and not smelling like a pool.</li>
            <li>...according to my barber who recommended a product like this when I started swimming frequently.</li>
            <li>it seems to remove chlorine after swimming - i&#x27;m somewhat sensitive to smells and after using this myself and two kids don&#x27;t smell like chlorine.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised at the difference it made.</li>
            <li>No green straw hair even when in the pool 3 days a week.  </li>
            <li>This product takes out the smell, does not strip the color and leaves my hair soft and</li>
            <li>But if I stop there, my hair will feel very straw-like the next day.</li>
            <li>I use this on my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair 3-4 times per week.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference if I use a different shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used this product for a long time and it never failed.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and WOW what a difference.  </li>
            <li>then i think this one is professional, it can reduce the times for washing my hair....</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and my wife likes it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really works or if it&#x27;s the only chlorine removal shampoo out there.</li>
            <li>and I added in the 5 yr old this time.</li>
            <li>However you will still need to use a conditioner to make your hair soft after swimming.</li>
            <li>I paid almost as much for 1 bottle at my local pharmacy as I did for 4 bottles at Amazon.</li>
            <li>He uses this shampoo and it really keeps the yellow out from the chlorine.</li>
            <li>, it feels moisturizing and completely removes the chlorine smell from my hair.</li>
            <li>She likes that her hair is soft, manageable and no chlorine smell.</li>
            <li>And as a moderately frequent swimmer (2x week)</li>
            <li>UltraSwim is so simple and really works.  </li>
            <li>, so I find I have to use extra product to get it to cover my whole head.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical but this is really good stuff.</li>
            <li>Possibly the public pools (in Las Vegas) carry more chlorine than other -I</li>
            <li>there are not many easily obtained choices.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good experiences using this product in the past, and now that I&#x27;m back in the pool again (4x a week), regular shampoo/conditioner just doesn&#x27;t cut it, especially in the chlorine smell department.</li>
            <li>After a few days of using this shampoo, she has noticed significant improvement in her hair.  </li>
            <li>Their hair, two very fine and one thick, is left soft and no trace of chlorine smell.</li>
            <li>Platinum blond hair that turned green did not come clean with this shampoo....</li>
            <li>This stuff smells decent enough and gets the chlorine out.</li>
            <li>This shampoo helped me care for my processed, porous hair during a daily high chlorine routine.</li>
            <li>Every time I got hot or wet, or perspired the smell became intolerable.</li>
            <li>We started using Ultra Swim and her hair is back to normal now.  </li>
            <li>However, after repeated uses of this shampoo after swims and a separate unrelated conditioning product, my hair is regularly in 95%+ normal condition.  </li>
            <li>After 2-3 days my hair was almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>It just makes it slightly more difficult to use than a nice thick formula.</li>
            <li>That worked a little better but still allowed my hair to get wet.</li>
            <li>We bough 4 bottles at once from Amazon and they shipped fast and will be used all summer long!</li>
            <li>and I got only 5 and half bottles and a job to clean up the spill.</li>
            <li>This shampoo wasn&#x27;t noticeably different from any general shampoo we normally use.  </li>
            <li>But both my kids have really light hair, and after only a few dips I started noticing a greenish tinge.  </li>
            <li>This got the green out of my daughters light blonde hair!</li>
            <li>In just a few uses his hair is back to super soft - almost baby soft.</li>
            <li>Never going back to its natural, soft beauty.</li>
            <li>People often comment that they can&#x27;t believe she has such long, shiny hair when she spends so much time in the pool!</li>
            <li>I hate the smell left in my hair after the pool even days later this stuff completely knocks it out, and it smells awesome.</li>
            <li>Multi pack is super convenient for those that use it on a daily basis, keeps the costs down.</li>
            <li>This stuff lathers just fine (at least for a guy).  </li>
            <li>Without proper hair management, my hair would become brittle over the entire season and gradually become a light brown color when it used to be black.</li>
            <li>This last summer I learned to swim as an adult and began hunting for anti chlorine products.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of days to get used to the smell, but now I don&#x27;t notice it, and it definitely rinses out completely.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has restored and continues to protect my 7 year old blonde hair swimmer.  </li>
            <li>It is back to being soft again after my conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li>I can barely breathe.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years but frequently have a problem finding it in my local drug store.  </li>
            <li>The next day the UPS guy picked up the product from my front porch and two days later I had a new one, at no return or additional shipping costs to me.  </li>
            <li>Wider distribution would probably help that, but this stuff really does help in keeping the hair from being extremely brittle.</li>
            <li>After the second wash, my 6 year old&#x27;s long, thick hair could easily be combed thru after her baths.</li>
            <li>This made my son&#x27;s hair go from awful and frizzy to nice and smooth and shiny again!</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>my hair will be clear but very very dry....</li>
            <li>This shampoo takes everything (good and bad) out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>This 2014 amazon.com shampoo was clear and runny and didn&#x27;t keep the green tint completely out of her hair.</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> A+, I&#x27;m glad I bought the four pack!</li>
            <li> Good price and shipped very quickly!  </li>
            <li> The results are amazing.</li>
            <li> make sure to wash my hair immediately after leaving the pool and use a generous amount of the shampoo so as to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li> This product is good, the hair feels Ok after using the shampoo and the chlorine odor is gone.</li>
            <li> I did some research and decided that the grapeseed oil I was using in her hair was probably having some kind of reaction with the chlorine.  </li>
            <li> My hair also has a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> The ash-color was gone, and a warm tone was revealed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Conditioner is kind of watery, so I apply a lot.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is ok, but does not leave hair feeling as good as others I have used.</li>
            <li> It seems to be popular at the pool, everyone else has it too.</li>
            <li> Or maybe it is just because the product is so diluted that it isn&#x27;t as effective?  </li>
            <li> I was mostly concerned, though, with ridding my hair of the damaging chlorine since I swim five days a week and Ultra-Swim seems effective.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is so effective that every time I go to my hair stylist he compliments me on how healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 years with great success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M FEEL VERY FINE MY HAIR WITH THIS SHAMPOO</li>
            <li> At this price for this quantity, it is a very good deal, particularly with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> Although a \\&quot;thin\\&quot; shampoo, it creates a rich lather and does a good job of getting rid of the chlorine.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no other alternative to this product and it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li> I experienced my first problem with amazon after 100 orders.  </li>
            <li> Now it looks like I have very lightly frosted tips.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and it always works wonderful and leaves my hair feeling nice.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used it and am pleased!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very good smell and leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Love Ultra Swim  shampoo.</li>
            <li> They say there is no chlorine damage and when they touch my hair, they cannot believe how healthy it feels (note--</li>
            <li> I finish my shampooing with my favorite brand of volume shampoo.  </li>
            <li> By finishing with my favorite volume shampoo, I&#x27;m sure the chlorine is out</li>
            <li> I love this product and will recommend this to my friends who love swiming.</li>
            <li> It says on the bottle that it is safe for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product and along with the ULTRA conditioner my hair has more body and manageability.</li>
            <li> I made sure to keep the UltraSwim conditioner on the directed 3 minutes and</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> Try with the conditioner for even better results.</li>
            <li> My go-to shampoo for healthy hair in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I have bought three and will buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and re-bought this shampoo many times on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Glad there is a way to get it because it is a must for summer.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to wash off the chlorine well, but I have to make sure to work it through her hair well.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many types of shampoo.</li>
            <li> It was UltraSwim, and I found it worked much better for swimmers like me.</li>
            <li> This is a truly worthwhile product.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The amount of time I &amp; my hair spend in the chlorinated pool would surely have turned my hair into shining silvery straw if it weren&#x27;t for Ultra Swim Shampoo.</li>
            <li> well it is ok, it does the job, but not for every day use.</li>
            <li> I swim often and was hoping this product would keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> but this is ok.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> .. love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to buy them some more.  </li>
            <li> help hair stay healthy even with swimming for 3+ hours a day</li>
            <li> I used the Ultraswim Shampoo and Conditioner religiously after every practice and my hair stayed in perfect condition.   </li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Three seemed to be better.</li>
            <li> Really keeps your hair in great condition during pool season.</li>
            <li> so I knew it would be ok.  </li>
            <li> Most will want to use a conditioner for that reason.</li>
            <li> This is one of our favorite staple products.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product after I swim at the pool for many years.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for kids in swimming team and they love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter swam for a summer in camp two times a week and ever since her hair has been more like a doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know and can&#x27;t day for sure</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> Even better when combined with Ultra Swim Conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I have more money in my wallet.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser saw the difference as well and was impressed with the results especially since it was not a \\&quot;salon\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> After the first wash, I noticed a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li> It conditions better on my three children ages 7, 11, and 14.  </li>
            <li> and I love this shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many swim caps with no luck.  </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and the fact that you get 4 at a time.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I shampoo with UltraSwim right after swimming to get all the chlorine out, follow it up with a good conditioner (Hair Rules), and if I want to do a treatment, I do a hair mayonnaise treatment.  </li>
            <li> It was always so soft and beautiful and the chemicals changed it.</li>
            <li> best shampoo i have found to remove chlorine from my children&#x27;s hair after long summer days swimming.</li>
            <li> It washes out the chlorine pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have fine and very light colored hair</li>
            <li> What makes a great company isn&#x27;t when you buy a product and are happy with it, few can screw that up.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem the best for scalp cleaning though, so sometimes I use a different shampoo when I&#x27;ve not swam to clean my scalp better.</li>
            <li> and they both make your hair smell good and nice and soft</li>
            <li> Also like that you can get squeaky clean hair without using a lot of the product!</li>
            <li> The most important thing you can do to help your hair is shower before you get in.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I don&#x27;t have any green-haired children this summer.</li>
            <li> Of course, finding a pool and using it is more important.</li>
            <li> far as smell goes, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li> , I really don&#x27;t think I would look good in &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews here, we have not been impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> It prevents drying and other hair damage perfectly.</li>
            <li> She swims daily so this is a great product to remove the chlorine build up and keep her hair shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Thus, Ultraswim shampoo comes very quickly out of these bottles.</li>
            <li> It would literally take an hour to comb it out with a fine tooth comb.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to be doing a fine job of removing chlorine.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant perfume and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference in the condition of their hair.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is a FANTASTIC product.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit pricy so buy the four pack at 4 dollars each with free shipping or look for it on sale in retail locations.</li>
            <li> if you get in a chlorine filled pool, you need this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my granddaughter, her mom thinks this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I will say my daughters hair is smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my hair, effectively removes the chlorine, and doesn&#x27;t leave it \\&quot;flat\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Got a great deal on the 4-pack, way cheaper than buying individual bottles at a store.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say this shampoo has restored my hair to 85% of its former self.  </li>
            <li> Great shampoo for regular swimmers</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this after swimming in the pool, so it&#x27;s important that we have it available to get out the cholrine.  </li>
            <li> Great shampoo not only for swimmers.</li>
            <li> shampoo does a very good job at removing chlorine as well as other minerals that can damage hair.</li>
            <li> (I do NOT recommend the UltraSwim Conditioner---use your favorite brand instead, as long as it&#x27;s a good quality brand---see my review of the UltraSwim conditioner for details).  </li>
            <li> but it seems that using the UltraSwim product has made a significant difference for her.</li>
            <li> but this does a good job in general.  </li>
            <li> Buying the 4- pack is really worth it!</li>
            <li> Anyone who spends a great deal of time in water like I do, knows that keeping her hair in good shape is tough when you need to find hair care products that will remove chlorine from your locks.    </li>
            <li> I swim 3 times a week in a pool that uses chlorine as well as a saline solution to clean the water.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to clean my bathing suit and skirt.  </li>
            <li> Then I clean both items with some of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The smell is clean, and beats smelling the chlorine on her any day.  </li>
            <li> We clean our hair with it and we clean our suits with it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair really clean with no hint of chlorine or choline smell.  </li>
            <li> In addition to removing pool chlorine, it leaves hair clean and silky.</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair and works like a charm on chlorine.</li>
            <li> While traditional clarifying shampoos are good and provide constant results, Ultra Swim is the best because it is specifically formulated to remove and strip the chlorine from the hair ends and restore hair to it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what we would do without it and the price is right!</li>
            <li> It seems to work ok, but you really have to vigorously shampoo the hair, and maybe even do it twice to get all the chlorine out.</li>
            <li> It is gentle to my hair and seems to take most of the chlorine out.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair sweet smelling and shiny.</li>
            <li> but I can say that as a (almost) daily swimmer, my hair stays in good condition and the gray doesn&#x27;t have a greenish cast as some blonds and grays take on....</li>
            <li> I use the Ultra Swim condition in addition on my hair only and it does seem to do a fairly good job of conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy this products cause it has such good reviews on it.</li>
            <li> In combination with the conditioner, it helps keep your hair from during green and brittle and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> works great to keep the damage minimal!</li>
            <li> Hey, what do I know, I am bold and gray.</li>
            <li> Sells out in stores quickly.</li>
            <li> and it helps my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li> I had tried high quality shampoos and conditioners, but this product is actually better.  </li>
            <li> We use just a little bit of the UltraSwim in the shower per instructions after swimming and it neutralizes the chlorine in our hair leaving it soft and healthy; and it smells nice, not perfumed but clean and nice.</li>
            <li> Better to use it in conjunction with your normal shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t do a lot for frizz/fine hair/volume/etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Along the lines of using more - it doesn&#x27;t foam up like normal shampoo</li>
            <li> I have naturally blond hair which is also very fine and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> As a new swimmer, I will continue to use this product, but I have to find something more...    </li>
            <li> Does leave your hair dry and brittle, so a good backup shampoo/condititoner is in order.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works, smells nice and does not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong on chlorine, but it&#x27;s also gentle, so I never have a flake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not because I have great hair---it&#x27;s all thanks to the UltraSwim Shampoo!</li>
            <li> where my daughter&#x27;s hair turned into a sticky tangled mess despite taking great care of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the UltraSwim conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize her hair enough, but definitely love the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of chlorine removal shampoos and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Very good for swimmers as well as other people who use normal mineral water.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and prevents kids hair from turning green and unmanagable.  </li>
            <li> With light-haired grandchildren, this works great to keep the chlorine green and straw</li>
            <li> I tried vinegar, rubbing a fresh lemon over my body, everything.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, so I ended up adding it to my regular shampoo and was able to create the results I wanted (more lathering ability).</li>
            <li> The Ultra Swim doesn&#x27;t get all the chlorine but leaves my hair fairly moisturized during the week and on Sundays the Paul Mitchell shampoo gets the rest of the buildup, and the deep conditioner really replenishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4 bottles is well worth it for a summer child.  </li>
            <li> Ultra Swim is a product that swimmers know is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Combining it with the conditioner make it so much more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> So worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Love how it take the chlorine ickies out and leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> the only kind that gets out the chlorine</li>
            <li> It also is economical in use.</li>
            <li> Because of last two concerns, you end up going through the bottles faster - so not cost effective</li>
            <li> I have white hair and it strips the pollution that yellows it and adds a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase IMO.</li>
            <li> It is a nice enough shampoo</li>
            <li> The price was pretty god so not a bad value but having the time to wash twice is a pain.</li>
            <li> We have tried other shampoos, nothing works better, nothing smells better.</li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo in the shower right after I come out of the pool.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?</li>
            <li> However, the conditioner restores everything right as rain.</li>
            <li> As soon as I squirt it into my cupped hand, it runs right trough my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Works well and delivery was right on time</li>
            <li> I use it right after swimming, and I don&#x27;t pre-condition, too much work!</li>
            <li> Hair feels super soft and smells grea!!!  </li>
            <li> bought for friend she likes very much</li>
            <li> I expected more clean hair than what it does.</li>
            <li> Great product hard to find else where.  </li>
            <li> sure enough, after my shower, I could tell that my hair felt</li>
            <li> ive been swimming consistently 3-5 times a week for close to 10 years.</li>
            <li> In order to keep my hair soft and damage free I follow with a concentrated conditioner.</li>
            <li> The fragrance when smelled in the bottle is pretty, but produces a 10 foot cloud around my daughter after she uses it.  </li>
            <li> I train in the pool several times a week and needed something better to wash out the chlorine...</li>
            <li> If anyone has a cure-all I&#x27;d be interested in hearing about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Avid swimmer, and this works well to get the closing dryness etc from hair.  </li>
            <li> I will try another brand next time to try for a better product.</li>
            <li> This works better than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The price here is a bit cheaper than when I bought my first bottle at Walgreens to try it out.  </li>
            <li> - so chlorine removal is an absolute MUST!  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use UltraSwim first to shampoo my hair thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> This stuff actually has a safe chemical in it that neutralizes chlorine.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> What else can I say about shampoo that&#x27;s specialized for swimmers except that it&#x27;s swimmer endorsed... by my swimmer ;-)</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo first to strip the bromine out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the next day service, Amazon!  </li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon!</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 is I just can&#x27;t say I &#x27;love&#x27; my shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li> The price was better than at the local drugstore</li>
            <li> * Need to use more (than regular shampoo) to get results</li>
            <li> It does not appear too harsh for my hair, which has stayed in good shape.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is that it is quite a bit cheaper than some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and clean...</li>
            <li> You need to be sure to use enough to get it to lather on your head and really activate (one review mentioned it doesn&#x27;t lather</li>
            <li> I could tell that my hair didn&#x27;t feel as good as it had after using the UltraSwim shampoo combo (mixed with my regular shampoo) and the UltraSwim conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shampoo that keeps my sons hair looking good after daily swim practice.  </li>
            <li> I swim, have a super sensitive scalp so can&#x27;t use conditioner and have baby fine super straight processed blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I would just suggest that for medium to long hair it is used twice to ensure a better result.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo when I my hair was relaxed, while it was transitioning and still use it as a full natural.</li>
            <li> Left my hair smelling fresh and clean instead of like chlorine.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo after every swim and not only did we all keep our hair in great shape, but my oldest daughters hair is actually going back to its original soft sweetness!!</li>
            <li> this year swim team practice but a lot of more strain on the hair but with help of UltraSwim shampoo and Dove intensive care conditioner by kids blond locks were admired rather than dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Unlike some sulfur-containing shampoos, this one smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to swimmers!</li>
            <li> As a regular swimmer, it is important to get the chlorine out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried this for a week straight and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> also, i happen to really like the scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> That product always worked well for me but as a clarifying shampoo it can be very harsh/drying on my hair.</li>
            <li> They can use it every day as it is gentle on their hair.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product if you have a swimmer.</li>
            <li> The wife really likes this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel very stripped otherwise.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been in swim lessons once a week now for over a year, and the smell of chlorine was really building up in her hair.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely fashion at a reasonable price, but does not work as well as promised.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo as a chlorine remover.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is so much healthier with this shampoo</li>
            <li> Now i need to use it at first then use my normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> If I stay in the pool any length of time, my hair turns very brittle</li>
            <li> Wish it were available year-round at places like Walmart, pharmacies, anywhere LOCAL.</li>
            <li> I would shampoo really well</li>
            <li> Her hair was getting very brassy and damaged by the chlorine...</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well for getting chlorine out of hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> My daughter swims on a team and her hair gets very chlorine saturated.  </li>
            <li> How do you ever know if a product really works?  </li>
            <li> This shampoo really does take the chlorine out.  </li>
            <li> I was really struggling with my hair.  </li>
            <li> One wash after swimming and the chlorine is really gone.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> Really like the scent afterwards - and no hint of chlorine.  </li>
            <li> Together, they really help limit some of the damage done by the chlorine.</li>
            <li> It really gets rid of the chlorine smell from my hair and body (didn&#x27;t do anything to help the suit).  </li>
            <li> Maybe because I&#x27;ve got really curly hair</li>
            <li> , I find this stuff really liquid.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it&#x27;s extremely effective at preventing damage.</li>
            <li> Easy fix is to show the older ones and apply it to my younger one.  </li>
            <li> One other note, I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and find I can use only about 1 in 10 hair products because most smell too strongly for me.  </li>
            <li> One of the other swimmers told me she used an Aveda detox-shampoo product that worked better without the chemical smell.</li>
            <li> It is long and was really getting damaged by frequent swims, but is healthy again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many other swim shampoos</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at about 90% back to its original shape fromTWO years ago.</li>
            <li> We have had an Endless Pool for many years, my wife and I swim three days a week.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected!</li>
            <li> Chlorine, particularly in indoor pools, can be very concentrated.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so I swim at the local YMCA regularly and I&#x27;m convinced they use pure Clorox because that pool has so much chlorine in there</li>
            <li> Also if you need a special shampoo for your hair you will still need to use it as this product ONLY REMOVES THE CHLORINE FROM YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a shampoo out there that can completely remove 100% of the chlorine from your hair when you swim ever day, but for the $, this stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I now alternate Ultra-Swim with other shampoos and use a different conditioner as theirs isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Love slight flavor of the shampoo  </li>
            <li> Left my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I would recommend lathering up with the shampoo particularly on the crown and the tips for maximum results.  </li>
            <li> It took only three or four uses to rid my greenish hair of a whole summer&#x27;s worth of chlorine.  </li>
            <li> This really does work and gets the chlorine right out of your hair and gets it back on track.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then, I went to have my hair cut and mentioned to my stylist that I had begun swimming regularly in a highly treated pool.</li>
            <li> ive tried ever high end</li>
            <li> My background in swimming comes from competitively swimming in high school and college about 8x a week, for 90 minutes during every swim.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, along with the Ultra Swim conditioner (see my longer evaluation there).</li>
            <li> Highly reccomended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone swimming.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use it, but I&#x27;m not really sure if the chorine has been removed or it&#x27;s just masked by the very strong fragrance the shampoo has.  </li>
            <li> i wish it had pump action rather than tilting cap - sometimes shampoo comes out too much.</li>
            <li> What makes a great company is how the react when something goes wrong.  </li>
            <li> Plus this shampoo is so cheap, I hardly expected this miracle from it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason we&#x27;ve been willing to go the extra mile, so to speak, is because this product really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using UltraSwim chlorine-removal shampoo for a few months now and just purchased more because it seems like it works.  </li>
            <li> I shower with it after my swim and my hair feels fairly normal for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> My tap water is normal, municipally-chlorinated water.</li>
            <li> After using Ultra-Swim for a short time, I (and others) noticed copper and golden highlights in my hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to be gentler than the normal drugstore shampoo I had been using on her.  </li>
            <li> It lays on the water as a gas and can actually cause reactions by being absorbed through the skin.  </li>
            <li> Leave no funky odor, just soft/normal hair when I use this and then use my normal conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Follow it with a good conditioner and while your hair may lighten in the sun, it won&#x27;t get green and dry.  </li>
            <li> This is our new swimming staple.  </li>
            <li> really think ths shampoo is meant for kids or young people who have a lot of natural oils in their hair.</li>
            <li> While conditioner is a must afterwards, this product makes a great shampoo and body wash, and left no discernible smell behind after over an hour in the pool.</li>
            <li> My two sons swim several times per week and their hair was becoming really dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> This product will keep your hair from becoming dry and brittle and should be used by anyone who swims in a chlorinated pool on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Usually just shampoo once and quick at that, and rarely do I have chlorine smell to hair.  </li>
            <li> but I believe that this product did just as good a job in keeping my hair black and soft as any other swim shampoo for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been purchasing Ultra Swim from a local store for a number of years, but unfortunately it&#x27;s only available at the one store that&#x27;s far from home.</li>
            <li> At first, I had no problems using my regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo removed it on first use and I will use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I purchase this pretty regularly.</li>
            <li> After shampooing with Ultra-Swim, I smooth the suds down my neck, chest, shoulders and and let the rinse water take it to parts south.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell, just a little too intense.</li>
            <li> Still not exactly the same as if I didn&#x27;t swim but far, far better.</li>
            <li> We have very fine hair and even though mine doesn&#x27;t turn green (just my 2 blonde girls), it would feel like straw.</li>
            <li> Then I follow-up with my regular moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, ending with a small amount of a leave-in good conditioner which helps protect my hair for the next swim.  </li>
            <li> We live in Southern California and the kids seem to spend the whole summer in pools and Chlorine .  </li>
            <li> My hair never looks dry - it is always shiny and healthy - and I am not a young person!!!  </li>
            <li> I am hoping to find the extra large bottle if there is any.</li>
            <li> Your hair will soak up the clean water and have less room for chlorine.</li>
            <li> That helped clear the smell out of the skirt.  </li>
            <li> For many years I just experimented with different shampoos and conditioners to take care of my short blonde &#x27;do and cut it short again in the fall.</li>
            <li> It not only gets out the chlorine smell but really conditions my hair adding body and decreasing the dryig effects of chlorine.</li>
            <li> I am using this shampoo on my 9yr old and 5yr old.</li>
            <li> and I really like my regular conditioner</li>
            <li> , she does still use her old conditioner</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> I have my hair professionally colored every 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> x 3 months of summer +3 bottles of Ultra swim shampoo &#x3D; thankfully soft manageable great-smelling hair all around.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, naturally blond hair</li>
            <li> I put about a teaspoon of olive oil in my hair using a soft bristled brush to distribute it.</li>
            <li> My daughter spends over 40 hours a week in the pool - this shampoo keeps her hair soft and manageable and not smelling like a pool.</li>
            <li> ...according to my barber who recommended a product like this when I started swimming frequently.</li>
            <li> it seems to remove chlorine after swimming - i&#x27;m somewhat sensitive to smells and after using this myself and two kids don&#x27;t smell like chlorine.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at the difference it made.</li>
            <li> No green straw hair even when in the pool 3 days a week.  </li>
            <li> This product takes out the smell, does not strip the color and leaves my hair soft and</li>
            <li> But if I stop there, my hair will feel very straw-like the next day.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair 3-4 times per week.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference if I use a different shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a long time and it never failed.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and WOW what a difference.  </li>
            <li> then i think this one is professional, it can reduce the times for washing my hair....</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really works or if it&#x27;s the only chlorine removal shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> and I added in the 5 yr old this time.</li>
            <li> However you will still need to use a conditioner to make your hair soft after swimming.</li>
            <li> I paid almost as much for 1 bottle at my local pharmacy as I did for 4 bottles at Amazon.</li>
            <li> He uses this shampoo and it really keeps the yellow out from the chlorine.</li>
            <li> , it feels moisturizing and completely removes the chlorine smell from my hair.</li>
            <li> She likes that her hair is soft, manageable and no chlorine smell.</li>
            <li> And as a moderately frequent swimmer (2x week)</li>
            <li> UltraSwim is so simple and really works.  </li>
            <li> , so I find I have to use extra product to get it to cover my whole head.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this is really good stuff.</li>
            <li> Possibly the public pools (in Las Vegas) carry more chlorine than other -I</li>
            <li> there are not many easily obtained choices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good experiences using this product in the past, and now that I&#x27;m back in the pool again (4x a week), regular shampoo/conditioner just doesn&#x27;t cut it, especially in the chlorine smell department.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this shampoo, she has noticed significant improvement in her hair.  </li>
            <li> Their hair, two very fine and one thick, is left soft and no trace of chlorine smell.</li>
            <li> Platinum blond hair that turned green did not come clean with this shampoo....</li>
            <li> This stuff smells decent enough and gets the chlorine out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helped me care for my processed, porous hair during a daily high chlorine routine.</li>
            <li> Every time I got hot or wet, or perspired the smell became intolerable.</li>
            <li> We started using Ultra Swim and her hair is back to normal now.  </li>
            <li> However, after repeated uses of this shampoo after swims and a separate unrelated conditioning product, my hair is regularly in 95%+ normal condition.  </li>
            <li> After 2-3 days my hair was almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> It just makes it slightly more difficult to use than a nice thick formula.</li>
            <li> That worked a little better but still allowed my hair to get wet.</li>
            <li> We bough 4 bottles at once from Amazon and they shipped fast and will be used all summer long!</li>
            <li> and I got only 5 and half bottles and a job to clean up the spill.</li>
            <li> This shampoo wasn&#x27;t noticeably different from any general shampoo we normally use.  </li>
            <li> But both my kids have really light hair, and after only a few dips I started noticing a greenish tinge.  </li>
            <li> This got the green out of my daughters light blonde hair!</li>
            <li> In just a few uses his hair is back to super soft - almost baby soft.</li>
            <li> Never going back to its natural, soft beauty.</li>
            <li> People often comment that they can&#x27;t believe she has such long, shiny hair when she spends so much time in the pool!</li>
            <li> I hate the smell left in my hair after the pool even days later this stuff completely knocks it out, and it smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Multi pack is super convenient for those that use it on a daily basis, keeps the costs down.</li>
            <li> This stuff lathers just fine (at least for a guy).  </li>
            <li> Without proper hair management, my hair would become brittle over the entire season and gradually become a light brown color when it used to be black.</li>
            <li> This last summer I learned to swim as an adult and began hunting for anti chlorine products.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of days to get used to the smell, but now I don&#x27;t notice it, and it definitely rinses out completely.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has restored and continues to protect my 7 year old blonde hair swimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is back to being soft again after my conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li> I can barely breathe.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years but frequently have a problem finding it in my local drug store.  </li>
            <li> The next day the UPS guy picked up the product from my front porch and two days later I had a new one, at no return or additional shipping costs to me.  </li>
            <li> Wider distribution would probably help that, but this stuff really does help in keeping the hair from being extremely brittle.</li>
            <li> After the second wash, my 6 year old&#x27;s long, thick hair could easily be combed thru after her baths.</li>
            <li> This made my son&#x27;s hair go from awful and frizzy to nice and smooth and shiny again!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> my hair will be clear but very very dry....</li>
            <li> This shampoo takes everything (good and bad) out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> This 2014 amazon.com shampoo was clear and runny and didn&#x27;t keep the green tint completely out of her hair.</li>
            <li> I use it with the UltraSwim conditioner too and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it behave differently than my normal shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My blond hair turns a little green after several days at the pool, but Ultra Swim removes the chlorine and returns it to its original color.  </li>
            <li> My hair is always silky soft and has no split ends or other damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other chlorine removal products we&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t work near as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> Earlier reviews talked about how this shampoo can leave your hair flat or greasy, etc.  </li>
            <li> means I&#x27;m going through a whole bottle a week (compared to one per month for my regular shampoo) for my just past shoulder length</li>
            <li> All I know is tha since we&#x27;ve been using this, my hair, the little one&#x27;s hair and her hair have been perfectly normal, and in her case, repaired.</li>
            <li> : Initially when writing my review, my hair was still in pretty bad shape after not using any special chlorine removal products for a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> The type that usually doesn&#x27;t have real complaints when it comes to chlorine.</li>
            <li> (the conditioner says to leave in that long, so I figured I&#x27;d give the shampoo the same amount of time).  </li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I will use as long as I swim in a chlorinated pool.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot, but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; up, which for my children make it a little harder to know how much to use.  </li>
            <li> The kids&#x27; hair was just as stiff and and brittle while using this product as it was using our normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am black with natural hair (3c-4a)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a handful of different products to clear out the green from the chlorine.</li>
            <li> Very dilute - half of it runs down the drain&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I use a highly chlorinated pool at least two days a week, have grey hair and it is essential to use chlorine removing shampoo to avoid &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; hair.  </li>
            <li> Four bottles will go a long ways,</li>
            <li> My hair (what I have left) was getting brittle and rough.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and said her long hair are easier to manage.</li>
            <li> but I could still smell chlorine ALL DAY LONG.  </li>
            <li> We started using this when our kids were young and doing year round swimming.</li>
            <li> I have used Ultra Swim for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am a male with thick brown hair, new to the world of swimming.  </li>
            <li> swim often and this really protects my hair and keeps the green out!!</li>
            <li> My seven year old son&#x27;s hair was getting brittle and stiff from swimming three times a week.</li>
            <li> Ultraswim conditioner make my hair really dry and not soft and silky like it claims.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is no different than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the chlorine and other residue left on my hair.  </li>
            <li> She has very long hair.</li>
            <li> that becomes very rough and coarse over the swim season because I do not wear a swim cap in the pool.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> It gets the chlorine out of my hair and skin and doesn&#x27;t dry them out.</li>
            <li> My daughter swims 6 days a week and had frizzy dry, chlorine smelling hair for the longest time.  </li>
            <li> (helps to prevent itchy dry skin from the chlorine &amp; water).</li>
            <li> but it made my hair tangle and so dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my daughter blond hair tried twice left in for 10 minutes the last time still green .</li>
            <li> and my daughter still has a few bottles left for next season.  </li>
            <li> A complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> ---you may need a bit more---I&#x27;ve got hair half way down my back and even with all my hair, I get it to lather properly).  </li>
            <li> As a result my hair has gotten very dry regardless of the shampoo/conditioning treatment that I do.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to work, my blonde daughter&#x27;s hair didn&#x27;t turn green or dry during her swim season!</li>
            <li> Helps eliminate chlorine from hair, but not effective at completely restoring hair to pre-chlorine condition.  </li>
            <li> and there is no hint of green in my platinum blonde hair.</li>
            <li> The pool I go to tends to over chlorinate the pool, yet I have absolutely no damage to my hair or even any signs that I swim.  </li>
            <li> I spritz and brush it through wet hair before I get in the pool, and then again after I shower.</li>
            <li> Before she gets in the pool we wet her hair.  </li>
            <li> Use everyday after se practice to get chlorine out not only for hair it also work well for body.</li>
            <li> I have a blonde haired daughter who&#x27;s hair often turns to straw and gets a hint of green tinge to it in the summer months.  </li>
            <li> But you must remember to thoroughly wet your hair BEFORE you swim and</li>
            <li> It feels stringy and rough.  </li>
            <li> However my husband mentioned that my hair has a skunky smell when wet after I use the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> When I received this order one bottle was completely empty, it had leaked out all of the inside of the box.  </li>
            <li> but my hair still gets wet.  </li>
            <li> I wear a cap however my hair still gets wet.  </li>
            <li> My kids were taking daily swim lessons and after a few weeks, their hair was turning to straw.</li>
            <li> I try to not get my hair wet in the pool, so the chlorine in my hair isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> I swim six days a week and without this lovely stuff my poor hair is stiff and dull.</li>
            <li> Usually, I shower and shampoo again in the evening, with a regular hair care shampoo, though, because this one leaves my hair with less \\&quot;life\\&quot; and bounce if it&#x27;s the only shampoo I use.  </li>
            <li> She had been using her usual shampoo and was dissatisfied with the ability of that brand to remove the chlorine smell, and was also looking for a product that does not dry her hair out.</li>
            <li> I still do have to use a harsh remover once every other week to get the extra</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, I squeezed the bottle way too hard and wasted a lot of shampoo.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Even when my hair was wet!</li>
            <li> I could not find a product that would work until I read the reviews for this product by other buyers.</li>
            <li> At first, my hairdresser recommended an expensive shampoo for removing chlorine, then I saw this UltraSwim on Amazon and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> So I usually also wash my hair with regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have never seen it in any other store, so</li>
            <li> UltraSwim removes it with one shampooing and is unbelievably priced low at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Can &#x27;t find it anywhere but here and one other swim site.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did not work for me as the other reviews stated.  </li>
            <li> If you use this please use it with other conditioner.</li>
            <li> Her hair is never dry, brittle, or dull.</li>
            <li> My 9-year old swims all summer and this has helped slow down the straw hair!  </li>
            <li> Hair still green and dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was green at the ends and dry.</li>
            <li> I swim on average, every other day.  </li>
            <li> We use Chlorine in the pool and it used to damage our hair, making it dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fragile hair (for years I was highlighting, perming, coloring, flat ironing, curling ironing, etc.).   </li>
            <li> Even though it says it&#x27;s hydrating be careful with using it too often as I did find it to be a little drying when I used it two days in a row.</li>
            <li> My hair was very green and it only helped a little.</li>
            <li> i also have long hair (well past my shoulders).</li>
            <li> I had dark hair, so never had a problem going in a chlorinated pool.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, black hair (male)</li>
            <li> Crazy, right?</li>
            <li> I have dark brown, almost black hair.</li>
            <li> The on line price is less than the drug store down the street.</li>
            <li> My daughter has blond hair and we have used this shampoo daily for the past month, and she still have green slimy hair!</li>
            <li> less chlorine will penetrate your hair.</li>
            <li> I had to ship back all 4 bottles which is silly, but it&#x27;s a big company, they have all this automated on their end -</li>
            <li> I wish there was something stronger or the pools put less chlorine.</li>
            <li> I had previously used run-of-the-mill garnier fructis shampoo.</li>
            <li> Since he won&#x27;t wear a swim cap, I&#x27;ve searched long and hard to find a product that will remove the chlorine build up.  </li>
            <li> This is particuarly hard on long hair for girls</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark blonde hair past my shoulders and always thought it was a dull ash-blonde.</li>
            <li> This stuff does dry out hair and make it stiff, so I usually use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Bought for my little boy who started taking swim lessons.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get chlorine out of hair, even a little.</li>
            <li> But this shampoo with their conditioner did little to help save my hair.  </li>
            <li> A little background info: I swim competitively year round, in the winter (September-February) and summer (April-August), 6 days a week for 2 hours each day.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find something to take the green out of my little girl&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I let my dark blonde hair get far to green before getting serious about removing the offending chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Prevents green hair.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo combined with the conditioner keeps my hair from getting dried out and removes the chlorine smell.  </li>
            <li> I have streaked hair so this helps get the chlorine out after I swim so it doesn&#x27;t turn green</li>
            <li> Both of my kids have green hair from swimming all summer.</li>
            <li> I got the Ultra Swim to use everyday after swimming</li>
            <li> I used to have problems with my hair turning green from the chlorine, but now after using this shampoo I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend for the everyday user.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like the chemically smell it left behind.      </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to use a heavy duty conditioner to maintain softness, but this hits the mark for removing chlorine.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after I swim.  </li>
            <li> I swam everyday this summer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a pool almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> I actually had to stop using it because I smelled worse than I would have if I had just smelled like chlorine.</li>
            <li> She has been swimming a couple days a week, but we have been using this shampoo even on the days she has not swam in the hopes of getting the green out.</li>
            <li> My daughter swims everyday in a chlorinated pool.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days of using UltraSwim, their hair was noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> This time, the package arrived with a missing cap.  </li>
            <li> I started swimming everyday and my hair turned to straw.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is not a great detangler.  </li>
            <li> Having two kids with blond hair and spending lots of time in chlorinated water this shampoo was a lifesaver with getting rid of the green chlorine hair.</li>
            <li> I used this brand in 2013 and it worked well to keep the green tint out of my daughters barbie-blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Ultra Swim prevents all the harsh side effects that chlorine can have on your hair.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday and have never had a problem</li>
            <li> Their hair kept getting a green tint and always smelled of chlorine.</li>
            <li> BUT it feels like a really harsh stripping shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it is a waste</li>
            <li> but I still need to use vinegar to get the green out</li>
            <li> My hair is stiff as a board.</li>
            <li> My son swims 4-5 times per week and his hair was stiff and breaking.</li>
            <li> ive had trouble getting ultraswim in the past.</li>
            <li> Although the instructions do not say to, I usually let it sit on my hair for a few minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather much, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too badly.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but necessary if you swim in a chlorinated pool.</li>
            <li> and I am usually in the pool 3-4 days a week.</li>
            <li> Not sure it is working as suppose to work - may be.  </li>
            <li> I usually swim about 50 laps in the morning, which takes me about an hour.</li>
            <li> But the conditioner unfortunately does not work the same</li>
            <li> have used it in the past 4 years after pool.</li>
            <li> Then shampoo and condition as usual.</li>
            <li> I swim a few times a week and wash my hair with this in swim days!  </li>
            <li> I am usually in the pool 2 hours each day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it helps</li>
            <li> Immediately changed my granddaughter&#x27;s thin, blond hair back to silky from feeling hard and brittle from swim team!</li>
            <li> Too many variables since 2 years have passed since the sever damage, BUT, she has long hair, so it&#x27;s not all new hair growth and it was still terrible, plastic-like and horrible to brush every day since that fateful swim summer.</li>
            <li> UltraSwim has a faint, but not problematic odor that is gone once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I always time it and keep the shampoo in for at least 3 mins.</li>
            <li> I was naive about how chlorine dries hair making it brittle and yes, unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> sometimes as late as 4 hours post-swim.  </li>
            <li> If you swim regularly and don&#x27;t want your hair to feel like its covered in crazy glue, use this stuff.</li>
            <li> Takes the chlorine out of skin and hair, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li> I know, it&#x27;s a liquid, duh.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure it removes the smell of the chlorine, yet just covers it up with something that smells even worse.</li>
            <li> We signed up for some serious swimming at our gym</li>
            <li> The same situation makes it doubly bad for one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad and seems to dissipate once the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long,thick, curly hair and post swim comb outs were really tough before this product.</li>
            <li> If you swim in public pool and hate dealing with chlorine in your hair , this is a must have.</li>
            <li> I color my hair too, which made the situation even worse.  </li>
            <li> it is irritating to the eyes.</li>
            <li> Unscented version needed, the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; smells worse than the chlorine would.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed, but it&#x27;s amazon</li>
            <li> I noticed that the shirt still had a &amp;#34;chlorine smell&amp;#34; to it , so I put both items in the washer on delicate using cold water.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how watered down both the shampoo and conditioner seemed (</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just too expensive compare to this.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m wrong.</li>
            <li> Oh, and this one is expensive at CVS but the price at Amazon is A LOT cheaper.</li>
            <li> It was my recollection that the shampoo was thicker and milky, but I could be wrong.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, and my hair still felt weird after I used</li>
            <li> I was SO sad.</li>
            <li> This product can be difficult to find on some store shelves.  </li>
            <li> i hate all the harsh chemicals in this, but without another option for removing the chlorine from my kids&#x27; hair we have been using this.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the formula is very thin and liquidy.  </li>
            <li> The results were disappointing.</li>
            <li> I rinse both items in cold water.  </li>
            <li> Then I rinse both items in cold water.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointment with the way the 4 pack was shipped.</li>
            <li> Removes chlorine, but leaves grease/residue that&#x27;s impossible to wash out.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> Painfully</li>
            <li> i hate the scent -- too artificial.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I gave my 4 bottles of Ultra Swim away  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> We were disappointed in the results of this product.  </li>
            <li> I use to hate how I still smelled like chlorine even after taking a shower, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.</li>
            <li> and I hate that chlorine smell.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t smell bad, either!</li>
            <li> I also smelled like the nasty chlorine water.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> Takes out the nasty chlorine smell too.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works well for my children.  They smelled chlorinated and this took it away.  Smells nice and fresh.  good price</li>
            <li> Left my hair smelling fresh and clean instead of like chlorine.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Good value.</li>
            <li> I have been swimming for over a month now, 4days a week. and there is no hint of green in my platinum blonde hair. The chlorine smell goes away. The only reason I did not give it a five is bc it&#x27;s drying to the hair. But I haven&#x27;t tried their conditioner so maybe that would help. I use a deep conditioning one bc of my bleached hair. I highly recommend this to swimmers! Esp. Blondes. You can&#x27;t be the price! Four bottles will go a long ways,</li>
            <li> great price for 4 pack!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been purchasing Ultra Swim from a local store for a number of years, but unfortunately it&#x27;s only available at the one store that&#x27;s far from home. It never goes on sale and the price never varies. Also, sometimes they&#x27;re out! Enter Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason we&#x27;ve been willing to go the extra mile, so to speak, is because this product really works. If my kids don&#x27;t use it their hair is trashed and they smell like walking swimming pools. We only wish they made a body wash, too!</li>
            <li> Ultra Swim seems to work well for my daughter.  She swims three days a week.  The nice thing is that it is quite a bit cheaper than some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great. I swim just about every day. My hair (what I have left) was getting brittle and rough. I also smelled like the nasty chlorine water. This stuff smells decent enough and gets the chlorine out. I use it as a body wash too after being in the pool and it works great on my skin as well. The chlorine smell was killing me before I bought this pack, and now I don&#x27;t reek like the pool everywhere I go... the price is right.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! Gets the chlorine out after just one wash and with my short hair; I don&#x27;t use a swim cap.  Left my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> My 9-year old swims all summer and this has helped slow down the straw hair!  We bough 4 bottles at once from Amazon and they shipped fast and will be used all summer long!</li>
            <li> I love to swim! But I don&#x27;t like what the chlorine does to my hair. Love Ultra Swim  shampoo. It gets chlorine out of my hair.</li>
            <li> My kids and I are in the pool 9 months of the year and without this product we would have straw on our heads.  Ultra Swim actually takes the chlorine out of your hair by binding it to sodium thiosulfate.  (ooh, fancy chemicals!)  Follow it with a good conditioner and while your hair may lighten in the sun, it won&#x27;t get green and dry.  I have used it for years and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.  I would not purchase it again.  My hair was very green and it only helped a little.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fragile hair (for years I was highlighting, perming, coloring, flat ironing, curling ironing, etc.).   This shampoo is amazing!   I&#x27;ve been swimming 3-4 times a week for 2 years now and even with the fragile hair I have, when I go to get it cut, every stylist that&#x27;s touched my hair tells me that they cannot believe I swim.  They say there is no chlorine damage and when they touch my hair, they cannot believe how healthy it feels (note--I&#x27;ve stopped all the damaging coloring, perming, etc. that I mention above, so that also helps).    I use this shampoo in the shower right after I come out of the pool.  You need to be sure to use enough to get it to lather on your head and really activate (one review mentioned it doesn&#x27;t lather---you may need a bit more---I&#x27;ve got hair half way down my back and even with all my hair, I get it to lather properly).  I always time it and keep the shampoo in for at least 3 mins. (the conditioner says to leave in that long, so I figured I&#x27;d give the shampoo the same amount of time).  I then use conditioner for 3 mins. (I do NOT recommend the UltraSwim Conditioner---use your favorite brand instead, as long as it&#x27;s a good quality brand---see my review of the UltraSwim conditioner for details).  I finish my shampooing with my favorite brand of volume shampoo.  Earlier reviews talked about how this shampoo can leave your hair flat or greasy, etc.  By finishing with my favorite volume shampoo, I&#x27;m sure the chlorine is out and them I get the body and bounce from another shampoo.    Even with all the swimming, my hair is healthier than ever.  The pool I go to tends to over chlorinate the pool, yet I have absolutely no damage to my hair or even any signs that I swim.  It&#x27;s certainly not because I have great hair---it&#x27;s all thanks to the UltraSwim Shampoo!</li>
            <li> Love slight flavor of the shampoo  Also like that you can get squeaky clean hair without using a lot of the product!</li>
            <li> Every summer I bleach my hair.For many years I just experimented with different shampoos and conditioners to take care of my short blonde &#x27;do and cut it short again in the fall. This last summer I learned to swim as an adult and began hunting for anti chlorine products.The difference in the texture and color hold of my hair was amazing! NO crunchy, wispy crispy ends! And no lingering swim smell. This shampoo helped me care for my processed, porous hair during a daily high chlorine routine. I am impressed and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I go to swim almost 2 or 3 times per week. This product helps me remove the chlorine and improve my hair quality. I love this product and will recommend this to my friends who love swiming.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great to remove chlorine.  I&#x27;ve used it since I was a kid (35 years!!). Prevents green hair.  Does not remove salt water though in my experience.</li>
            <li> My sons use this in conjunction with the cream rinse to help remove the chlorine.  In our experience nothing removes it all and this is not an inexpensive proposition.  Wider distribution would probably help that, but this stuff really does help in keeping the hair from being extremely brittle.</li>
            <li> It says on the bottle that it is safe for color-treated hair. I have used it twice, with the UltraSwim conditioner, and it has stripped some of the color out of my brown hair. My hair is stiff as a board. I will need to do a lot of conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;I really think ths shampoo is meant for kids or young people who have a lot of natural oils in their hair.</li>
            <li> Must have if you swim, detangkes and smells great.</li>
            <li> Must have for my kids to use after swimming. Before this, we bought Paul Mitchell but it&#x27;s just too expensive compare to this. Both works equally well.</li>
            <li> If you swim in public pool and hate dealing with chlorine in your hair , this is a must have. When used with Ultraswim conditioner it does an excellent job of taking chlorine out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using UltraSwim for over 30 years.  As a regular swimmer, it is important to get the chlorine out of my hair.  The shampoo combined with the conditioner keeps my hair from getting dried out and removes the chlorine smell.  It is expensive, but necessary if you swim in a chlorinated pool.</li>
            <li> Any one who swims regularly, needs chlorine removing shampoo.  The is the Best.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews here, we have not been impressed with this product.  I have 2 kids who swim competitively both during the winter season (Oct-Mar) and the summer season (Jun-Jul).  This shampoo wasn&#x27;t noticeably different from any general shampoo we normally use.  The kids&#x27; hair was just as stiff and and brittle while using this product as it was using our normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> A must have for swimmers. This is the only stuff that works on my daughter&#x27;s hair after being in the pool.</li>
            <li> Ultra Swim does a wonderful job of removing chlorine from my hair after spending an afternoon in the pool.  It not only gets out the chlorine smell but really conditions my hair adding body and decreasing the dryig effects of chlorine.</li>
            <li> Good product! I have streaked hair so this helps get the chlorine out after I swim so it doesn&#x27;t turn green</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Works well during the summer for my toe-headed swimmer.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff!  Usually just shampoo once and quick at that, and rarely do I have chlorine smell to hair.  Hair still needs a good conditioner.  I wish I had bought the conditioner of the same brand.</li>
            <li> Both of my kids have green hair from swimming all summer. I tried this for a week straight and nothing happened. Hair still green and dry. DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> After 8 months of swimming 3 times a week my hair was a wreck.  I was naive about how chlorine dries hair making it brittle and yes, unmanageable.  I color my hair too, which made the situation even worse.  I bought UltraSwim shampoo based on the comments here and in one washing I had my hair \\&quot;back.\\&quot;  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.    One other note, I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and find I can use only about 1 in 10 hair products because most smell too strongly for me.  UltraSwim has a faint, but not problematic odor that is gone once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I am using this shampoo on my 9yr old and 5yr old. It&#x27;s good shampoo for kids to use after swimming. It removes all chlorine and its odor also. Loved it!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product and along with the ULTRA conditioner my hair has more body and manageability.</li>
            <li> Ultra-Swim Chlorine Removal Shampoo is a great product. It does just what it says.     When you are in the pool on a regular basis you begin to smell chlorine on your body all the time. Taking Water Aerobics three times a week, I could not get away from the chlorine odor. It was in my hair and my skin. Every time I got hot or wet, or perspired the smell became intolerable. No amount of showering or shampooing removed the odor. I tried vinegar, rubbing a fresh lemon over my body, everything. Then I tried Ultra-Swim Chlorine Removal Shampoo.    After shampooing with Ultra-Swim, I smooth the suds down my neck, chest, shoulders and and let the rinse water take it to parts south. The results are amazing. Even while blow drying my hair with heat, the chlorine odor is gone. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown, almost black hair. The type that usually doesn&#x27;t have real complaints when it comes to chlorine. That was before I started swimming in a hotel pool that LOADS their water with hydrogen peroxide (and it tastes like salt, too!). At first, I had no problems using my regular shampoo and conditioner. About a week into swimming every day - even with a cap - and my hair started feeling like straw. Absolutely horrible. I tried leaving my regular conditioner in longer and even left some on the ends after my shower in the hopes of helping things. Didn&#x27;t work. So I started browsing the web and came across UltraSwim. Thank goodness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased both the UltraSwim Chlorine-Removal Shampoo and the UltraSwim Conditioner. I was disappointed in how watered down both the shampoo and conditioner seemed (the reason for giving 4*s and not 5). The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, so I ended up adding it to my regular shampoo and was able to create the results I wanted (more lathering ability). I made sure to keep the UltraSwim conditioner on the directed 3 minutes and sure enough, after my shower, I could tell that my hair felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that the chlorine-removal properties of the UltraSwim shampoo were what I was experiencing and I really like my regular conditioner, so I stopped using the UltraSwim conditioner and went back to using my regular conditioner. The results were disappointing. I could tell that my hair didn&#x27;t feel as good as it had after using the UltraSwim shampoo combo (mixed with my regular shampoo) and the UltraSwim conditioner. I switched back to the UltraSwim conditioner and the results improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I went to have my hair cut and mentioned to my stylist that I had begun swimming regularly in a highly treated pool. She said she couldn&#x27;t tell. Even when my hair was wet! After another appointment 2 months later - my stylist still can&#x27;t feel any chlorine build-up. If you are at your wit&#x27;s end and just can&#x27;t take it anymore, this is probably a good buy for you. You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?this is probably a good buy for you. You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?</li>
            <li> I use this as soon as I finish swimming but I don&#x27;t actually see any difference in my hair compared with how it was when I didn&#x27;t shampoo with this.</li>
            <li> ive been swimming consistently 3-5 times a week for close to 10 years. i also have long hair (well past my shoulders). this is the only swimmers shampoo that actually works. ive tried ever high end one just out of curiousity and bcs ive had trouble getting ultraswim in the past. and they did nothing to get rid of the chemicals. also, i happen to really like the scent of this shampoo. like chemical apples.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo workd great.  I have two blond children that swim twice a week and I can tell the difference after switching to this shampoo.  Their hair is no longer greenish crispy.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife, who swims quite regularly. She had been using her usual shampoo and was dissatisfied with the ability of that brand to remove the chlorine smell, and was also looking for a product that does not dry her hair out. I bought this for her based on the price and she has been very pleased, she does still use her old conditioner but it seems that using the UltraSwim product has made a significant difference for her. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I swim every day &amp; use this shampoo every day.  I use the conditioner twice a week.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years &amp; do recommend if you&#x27;re a swimmer.  Actually I use it in the winter too when I&#x27;m not swimming.  It makes my hair shiny &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> Been using it for ten years.</li>
            <li> UltraSwim Shampoo is excellent. In combination with the conditioner, it helps keep your hair from during green and brittle and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works !!  I swim in a chlorinated pool every day. My hair was green at the ends and dry. I use this every day followed by conditioner. My hair is soft and shiney. My hairdresser noticed the differenvce in my hair only a week after I began using it.  This is the only shampoo I will use as long as I swim in a chlorinated pool.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my daughter blond hair tried twice left in for 10 minutes the last time still green .</li>
            <li> I have my hair professionally colored every 5 weeks.  I am a brunette, but my stylist lightens it, and also puts in blonde highlights.  I swim 4-5 times a week, between 30-60 minutes each workout.  I use this shampoo as soon as I can get home, sometimes as late as 4 hours post-swim.  My colorist has told me that if I hadn&#x27;t told her I swim, she wouldn&#x27;t have known.  She says that there is no trace of chlorine or damage to my hair, and there it has also not been lightened by either the chemicals in the pool or by the shampoo.  I am VERY pleased!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters who swim almost every day in the summer.  It seems to work ok, but you really have to vigorously shampoo the hair, and maybe even do it twice to get all the chlorine out.</li>
            <li> Four daily swimmers x 3 months of summer +3 bottles of Ultra swim shampoo &#x3D; thankfully soft manageable great-smelling hair all around.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for after swimming. I have long hair and it always works wonderful and leaves my hair feeling nice.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, naturally blond hair and I am usually in the pool 3-4 days a week. I have always used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Shampoo Three which is designed to get chlorine out. That product always worked well for me but as a clarifying shampoo it can be very harsh/drying on my hair. I got the Ultra Swim to use everyday after swimming and now I only use the Paul Mitchell once a week along with a deep conditioning mask. This combo works well for me. The Ultra Swim doesn&#x27;t get all the chlorine but leaves my hair fairly moisturized during the week and on Sundays the Paul Mitchell shampoo gets the rest of the buildup, and the deep conditioner really replenishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a swimmer I can also recommend [[ASIN:B000TKH6G2 It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Leave In Product, 4-Ounces]]. I use this everyday and it&#x27;s extremely effective at preventing damage. I spritz and brush it through wet hair before I get in the pool, and then again after I shower. The most important thing you can do to help your hair is shower before you get in. Your hair will soak up the clean water and have less room for chlorine.</li>
            <li> UltraSwim removes the chlorine and the smell of it from your hair without drying it out.  I would recommend it along with Agree Swimmer&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li> I swim 3 times a week in a pool that uses chlorine as well as a saline solution to clean the water. I have naturally blond hair which is also very fine and prone to breakage. I used to have problems with my hair turning green from the chlorine, but now after using this shampoo I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make sure to wash my hair immediately after leaving the pool and use a generous amount of the shampoo so as to work up a good lather. Although the instructions do not say to, I usually let it sit on my hair for a few minutes before rinsing. In order to keep my hair soft and damage free I follow with a concentrated conditioner. Once it&#x27;s dry I put about a teaspoon of olive oil in my hair using a soft bristled brush to distribute it. My hair is always silky soft and has no split ends or other damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does a very good job at removing chlorine as well as other minerals that can damage hair. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I swim 4 or 5 times a week and have been using this now for over a month.  It is gentle to my hair and seems to take most of the chlorine out.  I still do have to use a harsh remover once every other week to get the extra but this does a good job in general.  I recommend for the everyday user.</li>
            <li> Works well at eliminating the cholorine.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo for the swimmer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been swimming for 40 years, my wife has been swimming for 40 years, my son has been swimming for 10 years. We are competitive swimmers. We have tried other shampoos, nothing works better, nothing smells better. If you have gills, webbed fingers, and breathe chlorine, do your hair a favor, shampoo with ultra swim.</li>
            <li> After a month of swimming laps, I noticed my hair started to look like straw.  So, I followed the pros advice, and began wetting my hair, coating it in conditioner, and then putting my cap on over that.  Nope, I still had straw hair!  So I bought this product, but I didn&#x27;t see that it made a big difference.  I also didn&#x27;t like the chemically smell it left behind.      One of the other swimmers told me she used an Aveda detox-shampoo product that worked better without the chemical smell. I gave my 4 bottles of Ultra Swim away  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This product is good, the hair feels Ok after using the shampoo and the chlorine odor is gone. I would just suggest that for medium to long hair it is used twice to ensure a better result.</li>
            <li> We have a pool in our backyard, so my kids are always swimming.  Out of no where my daughter&#x27;s hair turned into a sticky tangled mess despite taking great care of it.  I did some research and decided that the grapeseed oil I was using in her hair was probably having some kind of reaction with the chlorine.  It would literally take an hour to comb it out with a fine tooth comb.  We started using Ultra Swim and her hair is back to normal now.  It only takes 30 seconds to brush it out!  Before she gets in the pool we wet her hair.  As soon as she gets out we rinse it and wash it with the Ultra Swim, followed by a leave in conditioner.  We will be using this stuff after every swim, forever!</li>
            <li> I bought it, because I saw someone else using it at the pool shower room.  Even though i used it generously, I could still smell and feel my hair with chlorine....will try something different next time.</li>
            <li> We were disappointed in the results of this product.  It did not get the chlorine out as well as described.  We have finished one bottle and still there are traces   of chlorine in the hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter spends over 40 hours a week in the pool - this shampoo keeps her hair soft and manageable and not smelling like a pool. Try with the conditioner for even better results.</li>
            <li> My go-to shampoo for healthy hair in the summer.  My blond hair turns a little green after several days at the pool, but Ultra Swim removes the chlorine and returns it to its original color.  Better to use it in conjunction with your normal shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t do a lot for frizz/fine hair/volume/etc.</li>
            <li> No chlorine smell left after washing.  My hair is in good condition even with swimming 5 days a week!</li>
            <li> Good product and gets the chlorine out as promised.  Does leave your hair dry and brittle, so a good backup shampoo/condititoner is in order.</li>
            <li> At the beginning of every summer, I stock up on this product along w/the conditioner for my daughters who lifeguard at the pool.  They have beautiful. brunette hair and this product ensures that the sun &amp; chlorine keeps their hair healthy,  It has a very nice smell.</li>
            <li> I guess it removes the chlorine. I bought it for my daughter. The fragrance when smelled in the bottle is pretty, but produces a 10 foot cloud around my daughter after she uses it.  She has very long hair.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this to counter act the chlorine in the shower water.  Helps hold the color in your hair. Hey, what do I know, I am bold and gray.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and prevents kids hair from turning green and unmanagable.  I use it on both my son and daughter.</li>
            <li> best stuff out there!!! I wish it came in a gallon size bc I have three swimmers!!! I will always have this in my house!! One soaping and chlorine is gone. the smell and feel afterward is awesome too!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M FEEL VERY FINE MY HAIR WITH THIS SHAMPOO</li>
            <li> Use everyday after se practice to get chlorine out not only for hair it also work well for body. Recommended for all swimmer</li>
            <li> I am a daily swimmer.  I was losing my hair before switching to Ultra Swim. It removes the Chlorine from my hair, so it does not damage it. It also leaves my hair smooth.  It is a FANTASTIC product.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters are swimmers. This shampoo smells great and gets the chlorine out of their hair. They can use it every day as it is gentle on their hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this is really good stuff. I have bought three and will buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using UltraSwim chlorine-removal shampoo for a few months now and just purchased more because it seems like it works.  I shower with it after my swim and my hair feels fairly normal for the rest of the day.  Usually, I shower and shampoo again in the evening, with a regular hair care shampoo, though, because this one leaves my hair with less \\&quot;life\\&quot; and bounce if it&#x27;s the only shampoo I use.  I was mostly concerned, though, with ridding my hair of the damaging chlorine since I swim five days a week and Ultra-Swim seems effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and re-bought this shampoo many times on Amazon. It does the trick and removes the chorine smell. It can be a bit pricy so buy the four pack at 4 dollars each with free shipping or look for it on sale in retail locations.</li>
            <li> if you get in a chlorine filled pool, you need this shampoo. it will revive your hair and make it feel like hair again.</li>
            <li> I have a blonde haired daughter who&#x27;s hair often turns to straw and gets a hint of green tinge to it in the summer months.  She swims daily so this is a great product to remove the chlorine build up and keep her hair shiny and healthy.  You&#x27;ll need to use a heavy duty conditioner to maintain softness, but this hits the mark for removing chlorine.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great and is reasonably priced. Sells out in stores quickly. Glad there is a way to get it because it is a must for summer.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my granddaughter, her mom thinks this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Good price and shipped very quickly!  Most importantly, I don&#x27;t have any green-haired children this summer.</li>
            <li> Keeps me swimming daily!</li>
            <li> ...according to my barber who recommended a product like this when I started swimming frequently. Noticeable lack of chlorine smell, and I would recommend this. Good price</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well for me.  I use it everyday after I swim.  It does not appear too harsh for my hair, which has stayed in good shape.</li>
            <li> Cheapest place I could find.  4 bottles is well worth it for a summer child.  Works great to take out chlorine smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a competitive swimmer, swimming 4 times a week.  Without this shampoo, her hair would have been ruined.  This shampoo seems to wash off the chlorine well, but I have to make sure to work it through her hair well.  Then I use Biolage conditioning balm to moisturize.  Her hair smells great after the shampoo and the smell stays even after the conditioner.  I&#x27;ve tried the UltraSwim conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize her hair enough, but definitely love the shampoo!</li>
            <li> UltraSwim Chlorine-Removal Shampoo was ship on time.  Have been using for three weeks now.  Not sure it is working as suppose to work - may be.  I expected more clean hair than what it does.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this.  I train in the pool several times a week and needed something better to wash out the chlorine...this is perfect and gentle too!</li>
            <li> I bought this item to clean my bathing suit and skirt.  It does a superb job on the swimming suit- which is chlorine resistant, but not on the skirt- which is not chlorine resistant.  I rinse both items in cold water.  Then I clean both items with some of this shampoo.  Then I rinse both items in cold water.  I noticed that the shirt still had a &amp;#34;chlorine smell&amp;#34; to it , so I put both items in the washer on delicate using cold water.  That helped clear the smell out of the skirt.  I probably should have bought a cleaner specifically for swimsuits, but this item was recommended to me by a friend.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but it dries my hair and makes it freezzy</li>
            <li> My hair always gets damaged by swimming in the public pool. I tried so many types of shampoo. This shampoo works!</li>
            <li> A little background info: I swim competitively year round, in the winter (September-February) and summer (April-August), 6 days a week for 2 hours each day. My hair, being curly and unmanageable otherwise, becomes utterly and hopelessly tangled and brittle. The chlorine dries it out so every time I brush my hair, I need to take a shower with shampoo and conditioner just so I can actually do it.&lt;br /&gt;One day I borrowed my friend&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, which we often do after practice amongst our team members. It was UltraSwim, and I found it worked much better for swimmers like me. My hair was easier to comb and it left no chlorine residue... and it didn&#x27;t smell bad, either! I went out and bought both shampoo and conditioner myself and have been using it since then. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!!  It&#x27;s the only shampoo that keeps my sons hair looking good after daily swim practice.  Since he won&#x27;t wear a swim cap, I&#x27;ve searched long and hard to find a product that will remove the chlorine build up.  This is the only thing that will work.</li>
            <li> My daughter had fried swimmers hair. I could not find a product that would work until I read the reviews for this product by other buyers. I will say my daughters hair is smooth and shinny. I really recommend this product if you have a swimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I let my dark blonde hair get far to green before getting serious about removing the offending chemicals.  I swam everyday this summer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a handful of different products to clear out the green from the chlorine. If anyone has a cure-all I&#x27;d be interested in hearing about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointment with the way the 4 pack was shipped. The unsecured bottles leaked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a pool almost everyday.  I use UltraSwim after each session in the water.  It is gentle on my hair, effectively removes the chlorine, and doesn&#x27;t leave it \\&quot;flat\\&quot;.  My hair also has a nice shine.  The shampoo is so effective that every time I go to my hair stylist he compliments me on how healthy my hair is. I use the UltraSwim conditioner every couple of weeks, and while it is very good, the shampoo is GREAT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a shampoo out there that can completely remove 100% of the chlorine from your hair when you swim ever day, but for the $, this stuff works pretty well. Got a great deal on the 4-pack, way cheaper than buying individual bottles at a store. Stick with the shampoo, though - the conditioner is useless, and you&#x27;re better off just buying an ultramoisturizing one of another brand.</li>
            <li> The wife really likes this shampoo.</li>
            <li> it seems to remove chlorine after swimming - i&#x27;m somewhat sensitive to smells and after using this myself and two kids don&#x27;t smell like chlorine. it is irritating to the eyes. i wish it had pump action rather than tilting cap - sometimes shampoo comes out too much.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark blonde hair past my shoulders and always thought it was a dull ash-blonde. My tap water is normal, municipally-chlorinated water. I do not swim. After using Ultra-Swim for a short time, I (and others) noticed copper and golden highlights in my hair. The ash-color was gone, and a warm tone was revealed. I think that the chlorine in the tap water had accumulated in my hair. I now alternate Ultra-Swim with other shampoos and use a different conditioner as theirs isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Avid swimmer, and this works well to get the closing dryness etc from hair.  I also use it to rinse my bathing suit</li>
            <li> This is great. Immediately changed my granddaughter&#x27;s thin, blond hair back to silky from feeling hard and brittle from swim team! Don&#x27;t even need a conditioner after.</li>
            <li> This has made a great difference in my hair. It is long and was really getting damaged by frequent swims, but is healthy again. I am pleasantly surprised at the difference it made.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I have been swimming several times a week for several years now. At first, my hairdresser recommended an expensive shampoo for removing chlorine, then I saw this UltraSwim on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It gets the chlorine out and it works so well that I also use it as a body wash when I shower after swimming. It gets the chlorine out of my hair and skin and doesn&#x27;t dry them out. I use to hate how I still smelled like chlorine even after taking a shower, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a truly worthwhile product.  No green straw hair even when in the pool 3 days a week.  Takes out the nasty chlorine smell too.</li>
            <li> I swim laps 2-3 times a week and always use this afterwards.  I can&#x27;t tell that my hair has been in a chlorinated pool.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell left in my hair after the pool even days later this stuff completely knocks it out, and it smells awesome. I use it with the UltraSwim conditioner too and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it behave differently than my normal shampoo and conditioner. I also use it to get chlorine out of my swim suit. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> works great to keep the damage minimal!</li>
            <li> As a triatlete I swim 3- 5 times a week.  I was worred about chorine damage to my color treated hair and I hate that chlorine smell. This product works great! I have been using it for 2 years with great success. This product takes out the smell, does not strip the color and leaves my hair soft and shiney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ultra Swim for almost the18 years I have been a swim instructor and life guard.  The amount of time I &amp; my hair spend in the chlorinated pool would surely have turned my hair into shining silvery straw if it weren&#x27;t for Ultra Swim Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for swimmers!</li>
            <li> I use a highly chlorinated pool at least two days a week, have grey hair and it is essential to use chlorine removing shampoo to avoid &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; hair.  there are not many easily obtained choices.</li>
            <li> Unscented version needed, the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; smells worse than the chlorine would. I actually had to stop using it because I smelled worse than I would have if I had just smelled like chlorine. Please make an option to buy an unscented version.</li>
            <li> I usually swim about 50 laps in the morning, which takes me about an hour. So I end up having my hair soaked in chlorine for a good amount of time. This product definitely gets the chlorine out. It doesn&#x27;t lather much, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too badly. One downside I&#x27;ve found is that you definitely can&#x27;t use it on it&#x27;s own. I use this and the corresponding conditioner. But if I stop there, my hair will feel very straw-like the next day. So I usually also wash my hair with regular shampoo and conditioner. But this product is definitely a must have for me. It gets the chlorine out.</li>
            <li> well it is ok, it does the job, but not for every day use. will use only for summer when i swim</li>
            <li> I swim often and was hoping this product would keep my hair healthy. It&#x27;s a bit diluted and takes quite a lot of shampoo to wash my medium length hair. I also seem to have to shampoo twice until the chlorine smell is gone. I haven&#x27;t tried many other swim shampoos so don&#x27;t know what else is out there but this is ok. I will try another brand next time to try for a better product. The price was pretty god so not a bad value but having the time to wash twice is a pain.</li>
            <li> My kids use this after swim team and it works well. A little bit goes a long way. The three pack I order usually last six months between three kids.</li>
            <li> great product. I have been using for years.  This is a very good shampoo and truly takes away any pool chlorine or pool smell  I use the product every day with another shampoo. This is a very good product  I have always had great delivery and through Amazon get a great price.  Look at buying the multiple pack for savings</li>
            <li> I am a male with thick brown hair, new to the world of swimming.  I started swimming in a chlorine-filled pool 3 or 4 times a week in the last couple months.  I am happy to say this shampoo has restored my hair to 85% of its former self.  Nevertheless, I think I need an additional stronger chlorine removal product and/or a really good conditioner.  Please note that the number one ingredient in this shampoo is water.  Thus, Ultraswim shampoo comes very quickly out of these bottles. The first few times I used it, I squeezed the bottle way too hard and wasted a lot of shampoo.  As a new swimmer, I will continue to use this product, but I have to find something more...    Review edit 6 months later: Initially when writing my review, my hair was still in pretty bad shape after not using any special chlorine removal products for a couple of months.  However, after repeated uses of this shampoo after swims and a separate unrelated conditioning product, my hair is regularly in 95%+ normal condition.  I now fully recommend this product.  Don&#x27;t forget to load up on good conditioner...</li>
            <li> Swimmers rejoice!!  Anyone who spends a great deal of time in water like I do, knows that keeping her hair in good shape is tough when you need to find hair care products that will remove chlorine from your locks.    I swim on average, every other day.  While traditional clarifying shampoos are good and provide constant results, Ultra Swim is the best because it is specifically formulated to remove and strip the chlorine from the hair ends and restore hair to it&#x27;s natural state. I would recommend lathering up with the shampoo particularly on the crown and the tips for maximum results.  I notice there is no lingering chlorine smell which is great!!  Ultra Swim is a product that swimmers know is worth every penny.  A great product.  Ultra Swim keeps my hair looking great, without the damaging side affects of chlorine.</li>
            <li> I swim about 4-5 days a week, and my hair was getting brittle and crunchy.  It took about 3 or so shampooings with Ultraswim before I started noticing a difference.  But, in all fairness it has definitely made a difference.  Just be warned that you NEED to use a conditioner with this shampoo.  Your hair will feel very stripped otherwise.  Ultraswim&#x27;s conditioner is as good a choice as any.    The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the formula is very thin and liquidy.  It just makes it slightly more difficult to use than a nice thick formula.</li>
            <li> This works, I like it.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair 3-4 times per week.  She&#x27;s been in swim lessons once a week now for over a year, and the smell of chlorine was really building up in her hair.  This works better than regular shampoo.  The smell of chlorine is still there a bit, but nothing like before.  She never cries if it gets in her eyes either.  It seems to be gentler than the normal drugstore shampoo I had been using on her.  The smell is clean, and beats smelling the chlorine on her any day.  The price here is a bit cheaper than when I bought my first bottle at Walgreens to try it out.  I have never seen it in any other store, so buying online is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying something else. My daughter has blond hair and we have used this shampoo daily for the past month, and she still have green slimy hair! She has been swimming a couple days a week, but we have been using this shampoo even on the days she has not swam in the hopes of getting the green out. I am not sure it removes the smell of the chlorine, yet just covers it up with something that smells even worse.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely fashion at a reasonable price, but does not work as well as promised. Platinum blond hair that turned green did not come clean with this shampoo....tomato juice worked better!</li>
            <li> I am a 5-day a week swimmer and I buy this shampoo in multi-packs!  I have fine and very light colored hair - so chlorine removal is an absolute MUST!  I prefer to use UltraSwim first to shampoo my hair thoroughly.  Then I follow-up with my regular moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, ending with a small amount of a leave-in good conditioner which helps protect my hair for the next swim.  My hair never looks dry - it is always shiny and healthy - and I am not a young person!!!  I have tried several brands of chlorine removal shampoos and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Removes chlorine, but leaves grease/residue that&#x27;s impossible to wash out. I&#x27;ll have to make a salon appointment to strip my hair.</li>
            <li> I also just discovered that it gets the chlorine out of swimsuits too! Way cheaper than suit saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just a marketing gimmick....This stuff actually has a safe chemical in it that neutralizes chlorine.</li>
            <li> My daughter swims everyday in a chlorinated pool.  I wanted to prevent damage to her beautiful hair.  This helps keep her hair healthly looking and the price is great.</li>
            <li> My two sons swim several times per week and their hair was becoming really dry and brittle. Within a few days of using UltraSwim, their hair was noticeably softer. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had dark hair, so never had a problem going in a chlorinated pool.  But both my kids have really light hair, and after only a few dips I started noticing a greenish tinge.  We use this all summer as their regular shampoo, and have no problems anymore.</li>
            <li> Helps eliminate chlorine from hair, but not effective at completely restoring hair to pre-chlorine condition.  Painfully S...L...O...W... shipping from this company.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best to rinse out the chlorine from my hair when I swim.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very good smell and leave my hair soft.But the conditioner unfortunately does not work the same</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. My hair feels clean and soft. Before I started to use it my hair felt crunchy and smelled of chlorine.</li>
            <li> have been using this shampoo for boy and girl.. works great and takes out the chlorine and the smell.. love it</li>
            <li> This shampoo is no different than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works, smells nice and does not dry out my hair. This is the first time I have used it and am pleased!!</li>
            <li> Both my college age daughters teach swim lessons and I bought this on impulse to help them get the chlorine out of their hair. They tried it and loved it!  I&#x27;m about to buy them some more.  If you are a swimmer (or the father of one) this is a good product for you.</li>
            <li> help hair stay healthy even with swimming for 3+ hours a day</li>
            <li> this does seem to get the chlorine out and leave my hair softer. It doesn&#x27;t seem the best for scalp cleaning though, so sometimes I use a different shampoo when I&#x27;ve not swam to clean my scalp better.</li>
            <li> My background in swimming comes from competitively swimming in high school and college about 8x a week, for 90 minutes during every swim. I have thick, black hair (male) that becomes very rough and coarse over the swim season because I do not wear a swim cap in the pool. Without proper hair management, my hair would become brittle over the entire season and gradually become a light brown color when it used to be black. I have tried more expensive products including [[ASIN:B0041LAZRC Reflect H2O Swim Conditioner]], but I believe that this product did just as good a job in keeping my hair black and soft as any other swim shampoo for a fraction of the price. I used the Ultraswim Shampoo and Conditioner religiously after every practice and my hair stayed in perfect condition.   *DISCLAIMER: I will post an almost identical product review on the Ultraswim Conditioner because I believe these products go best \\&quot;hand-in-hand\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It helps, but you must you a conditioner. Paul Mitchell Three seemed to be better. Ultra Swim conditioner doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It takes away the chlorine smell and leaves your hair smelling and feeling great.  Would recommend without reservation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ultra Swim shampoo for years now. It has lept my hair intact, even after years of exposure to chlorine. I will continue to use it and recommend it to anyone that swims in pools.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo as a chlorine remover. I can really tell the difference if I use a different shampoo.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo.  Leaves my hair sweet smelling and shiny.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great. we all have used it for years now.</li>
            <li> AAA+++ Would buy from this supplier without hesitation!!!</li>
            <li> This works well and is great for the price.</li>
            <li> Combining it with the conditioner make it so much more manageable and soft.  Hair feels super soft and smells grea!!!  Multi pack is super convenient for those that use it on a daily basis, keeps the costs down.</li>
            <li> Bought for my little boy who started taking swim lessons. His hair does not feel like straw anymore after I switched to ultra swim shampoo and conditioner. Conditioner is kind of watery, so I apply a lot.</li>
            <li> Although a \\&quot;thin\\&quot; shampoo, it creates a rich lather and does a good job of getting rid of the chlorine. But you must remember to thoroughly wet your hair BEFORE you swim and less chlorine will penetrate your hair. This product will keep your hair from becoming dry and brittle and should be used by anyone who swims in a chlorinated pool on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I swim about a mile a day and this stuff works great for getting the Cl out.  I tried regular shampoo, but it just wouldn&#x27;t work.  I disagree with another review of this that it doesn&#x27;t lather well.  It sounds like you need to soften your water a bit.  This stuff lathers just fine (at least for a guy).  It&#x27;s a must to get the conditioner with this.  This shampoo takes everything (good and bad) out of your hair.  It feels stringy and rough.  However, the conditioner restores everything right as rain.</li>
            <li> So worth the purchase.  Other chlorine removal products we&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t work near as well as this one.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is so much healthier with this shampoo</li>
            <li> This is the best chlorine-removal shampoo I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve been using it for 10+ years with excellent results. Before I found out about it my hair always looked frizzled and stood out. When I lived in Florida they sold it at all the stores but now I can only find it here on Amazon. It&#x27;s probably cheaper any. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for regular swimmers</li>
            <li> If you swim regularly and don&#x27;t want your hair to feel like its covered in crazy glue, use this stuff.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does a really great job removing chlorine. I used this product for a long time and it never failed. Buying the 4- pack is really worth it!</li>
            <li> One bottle leaked all over the inside of the shipping box. Shampoo is ok, but does not leave hair feeling as good as others I have used.</li>
            <li> Good price and good product. My daughter loves it and said her long hair are easier to manage. She used it after every swim.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! Highly recommend, along with the Ultra Swim conditioner (see my longer evaluation there). Love how it take the chlorine ickies out and leave my hair soft and shiny. Oh, and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s pricing on these two products.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for swimmers.  One application gets the chlorine out!</li>
            <li> I swim every day and my hair was suffering.  I tried this product and WOW what a difference.  Gets rid of the chlorine and other residue left on my hair.  Leaves my hair soft and smooth.  However my husband mentioned that my hair has a skunky smell when wet after I use the shampoo.  It&#x27;s not too bad and seems to dissipate once the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I color my hair so I want to get the Chorine out as soon as possible when I swim.  I use it, but I&#x27;m not really sure if the chorine has been removed or it&#x27;s just masked by the very strong fragrance the shampoo has.  Not a bad smell, just a little too intense.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no other alternative to this product and it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li> Before i use this. i always use shampoo twice everytime after swimming to protect my hair. then i think this one is professional, it can reduce the times for washing my hair....but i&#x27;m wrong. Now i need to use it at first then use my normal shampoo. it is also twice! if i did do that but only use Ultraswim. my hair will be clear but very very dry....</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product from Amazon from time to time.  This time, the package arrived with a missing cap.  As a result, the shampoo spilled all over and I got only 5 and half bottles and a job to clean up the spill.</li>
            <li> great to keep hear nice and in good condition after swim.&lt;br /&gt;we have used it in the past 4 years after pool. this year swim team practice but a lot of more strain on the hair but with help of UltraSwim shampoo and Dove intensive care conditioner by kids blond locks were admired rather than dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Really keeps your hair in great condition during pool season. My daughter has long,thick, curly hair and post swim comb outs were really tough before this product.</li>
            <li> Great price and delivered promptly.  What else can I say about shampoo that&#x27;s specialized for swimmers except that it&#x27;s swimmer endorsed... by my swimmer ;-)</li>
            <li> This is our new swimming staple.  We clean our hair with it and we clean our suits with it.  It does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> What makes a great company isn&#x27;t when you buy a product and are happy with it, few can screw that up.  What makes a great company is how the react when something goes wrong.  I experienced my first problem with amazon after 100 orders.  When I received this order one bottle was completely empty, it had leaked out all of the inside of the box.  I was annoyed, but it&#x27;s amazon so I knew it would be ok.  I went through their return process which was quite simple.  The next day the UPS guy picked up the product from my front porch and two days later I had a new one, at no return or additional shipping costs to me.  I had to ship back all 4 bottles which is silly, but it&#x27;s a big company, they have all this automated on their end - I get that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it&#x27;s great.  I swim 3 times a week and without this stuff my hair becomes like wire.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses the shampoo and conditioner every time she gets off the pool and they work well.</li>
            <li> This got the green out of my daughters light blonde hair!</li>
            <li> Swim a lot and use it. Takes the chlorine out of skin and hair, at least in my experience. Of course, finding a pool and using it is more important.</li>
            <li> I swim  laps regularly.  Regular shampoo didn&#x27;t remove chlorine build-up.  This shampoo removed it on first use and I will use it regularly.</li>
            <li> My seven year old son&#x27;s hair was getting brittle and stiff from swimming three times a week. I bought this shampoo at our local swim shop and it&#x27;s done wonders. In just a few uses his hair is back to super soft - almost baby soft. I am hoping to find the extra large bottle if there is any. This product has worked great in our home and it smells delicious too.</li>
            <li> Chlorine, particularly in indoor pools, can be very concentrated.  It lays on the water as a gas and can actually cause reactions by being absorbed through the skin.  The same situation makes it doubly bad for one&#x27;s hair.  I had tried high quality shampoos and conditioners, but this product is actually better.  Highly reccomended.  Good delivery.</li>
            <li> it removes chlorine from your hair. it does it well. my hair is soft and my wife likes it. buy this product.</li>
            <li> I started swimming everyday and my hair turned to straw. I have long, thick, fine hair. This was not optimal. So I tried using a swim cap. That worked a little better but still allowed my hair to get wet. That and I had a headache by the end of the hour. Once I started using this shampoo, my hair is back to being just as lustrous as it ever was. I use this shampoo first to strip the bromine out of my hair. Then shampoo and condition as usual. (I use Tigi Bed Head Superstar Shampoo and Aussie Moist conditioner.) The smell is gone and the chemicals do not damage my hair. Great shampoo! I have not tried their swimsuit wash but am planning on trying it out, too.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is a great product for those who are &amp;#34;swimmers&amp;#34;.  I have &amp;#34;colored&amp;#34; hair and always always worry about being in the chlorinated pool water during the summer, I really don&#x27;t think I would look good in &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;.  This shampoo has eliminated that fear.  I really loved the feel of my hair after using this product, as well as the ease of styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who using a pool - whether you have colored hair or not - since chlorine is NOT your hairs friend, UltraSwim is!</li>
            <li> swim often and this really protects my hair and keeps the green out!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Ultra Swim!  It literally saved my daughter&#x27;s hair this summer.  Last summer, after swimming daily and sun exposure, I had to cut 5 inches off her hair.  This summer, I washed her hair daily with Ultra Swim and then used a leave in conditioner and her hair is silky!</li>
            <li> i had to have this! my daughters hair was unmanageable after being in the pool for hours that she didn&#x27;t want to go swimming anymore. this saved us!</li>
            <li> If I stay in the pool any length of time, my hair turns very brittle/turns to straw.  I&#x27;m very glad to have found this shampoo because it has saved me from straw hair.  Leave no funky odor, just soft/normal hair when I use this and then use my normal conditioner.  Wish it were available year-round at places like Walmart, pharmacies, anywhere LOCAL.</li>
            <li> I took up swimming for physical therapy 3 times a week.  I use a swim cap but my hair still gets wet.  I would shampoo really well but I could still smell chlorine ALL DAY LONG.  With Ultra Swim it takes all the smell away, I love it!</li>
            <li> I swim, have a super sensitive scalp so can&#x27;t use conditioner and have baby fine super straight processed blonde hair.  I use this shampoo exclusively, whether I&#x27;ve swum that day or not.  It leaves my hair really clean with no hint of chlorine or choline smell.  Not drying.  Only drawback is not a great detangler.  Most will want to use a conditioner for that reason.</li>
            <li> Swim season is over and my daughter still has a few bottles left for next season.  Great product hard to find else where.  Love the next day service, Amazon!  This is one of our favorite staple products.  Thanks again Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love it I didn&#x27;t think it would work but I noticed it gets rod of the chlorine smell and my hair is not as damaged</li>
            <li> It seemed to work, my blonde daughter&#x27;s hair didn&#x27;t turn green or dry during her swim season!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent for removing chlorine after swimming. At this price for this quantity, it is a very good deal, particularly with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> Same as the product sold in the stores. Does a good job of removing chlorine from hair. I wish there was something stronger or the pools put less chlorine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product after I swim at the pool for many years.  It removes all of the pool chemicals and leaves my hair in good condition.  Please continue offering this product.</li>
            <li> I use this after all my swim workouts and it does a great job in cleansing my hair and with some conditioner your hair won&#x27;t feel like you just swam.  Granted I have short hair so I can&#x27;t comment on tangles, etc...but for an after swim shampoo it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I am black with natural hair (3c-4a) and I love this product! I use it right after swimming, and I don&#x27;t pre-condition, too much work! Rather I always have my hair in a protective style when I swim (braids, twist, etc.) and I use my swimming days as the time to do hair treatment. I shampoo with UltraSwim right after swimming to get all the chlorine out, follow it up with a good conditioner (Hair Rules), and if I want to do a treatment, I do a hair mayonnaise treatment.  If I don&#x27;t want to do a treatment, then I put in a leave in conditioner, and keep on with my day. I have used this shampoo when I my hair was relaxed, while it was transitioning and still use it as a full natural. I haven&#x27;t had any hair shedding or drying with this shampoo, overall no hindrance on my hair health! It works for me, so I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> We started using this when our kids were young and doing year round swimming. Having two kids with blond hair and spending lots of time in chlorinated water this shampoo was a lifesaver with getting rid of the green chlorine hair.</li>
            <li> Good after-pool swim shampoo and at a good price.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of days to get used to the smell, but now I don&#x27;t notice it, and it definitely rinses out completely.  It took only three or four uses to rid my greenish hair of a whole summer&#x27;s worth of chlorine.  Now I use it every time I go to the pool.  It&#x27;s strong on chlorine, but it&#x27;s also gentle, so I never have a flake.</li>
            <li> I swim a few times a week and wash my hair with this in swim days!  I bleach (highlight) my hair and the chlorine never effects  or damages my hair.</li>
            <li> Does a good job in removing chlorine from my kids hair. I command it.</li>
            <li> My son swims 4-5 times per week and his hair was stiff and breaking. After using this shampoo, his hair got smoother and shiny. I used for myself and it indeed made the difference. Also it smells good. I highly recommend to anyone swimming. Oh, and this one is expensive at CVS but the price at Amazon is A LOT cheaper.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has restored and continues to protect my 7 year old blonde hair swimmer.  Her hair was getting very brassy and damaged by the chlorine...this shampoo stripped the chlorine (over time) and continues to protect her hair...we also use the ultra swim conditioner.  A must product if you are in a chlorinated pool regularly!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well for removing chlorine post swim.  This stuff does dry out hair and make it stiff, so I usually use [[ASIN:B0009I4MKW Nexxus Therappe Shampoo, 33.8 oz]] after using this, and then put in conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. It doesn&#x27;t get chlorine out of hair, even a little. A complete waste of money! Do not buy!!</li>
            <li> I used this brand in 2013 and it worked well to keep the green tint out of my daughters barbie-blonde hair.  It was my recollection that the shampoo was thicker and milky, but I could be wrong.  This 2014 amazon.com shampoo was clear and runny and didn&#x27;t keep the green tint completely out of her hair.</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well for getting chlorine out of hair without damaging it. Unlike some sulfur-containing shampoos, this one smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for kids in swimming team and they love it.</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 is I just can&#x27;t say I &#x27;love&#x27; my shampoo.  LOL  This product seems to be doing a fine job of removing chlorine.  I accidentally ordered this stuff twice so am well stocked.  This turned out well as I have been using it to shampoo with and as a body wash.  No chlorine smell after the shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, and my hair still felt weird after I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I bought four bottles!</li>
            <li> It seems to be popular at the pool, everyone else has it too. I don&#x27;t know if it really works or if it&#x27;s the only chlorine removal shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> After months of swimming my hair was beginning to turn &amp;#34;blorange&amp;#34; (blonde/orange).  Then I heard about Ultra Swim.  Now it looks like I have very lightly frosted tips.  Better than it was but not perfect. If you swim a lot buy the 4 pack.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is designed to take the chlorine out of your hair. I swim six days a week and without this lovely stuff my poor hair is stiff and dull. This works. I love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter swam for a summer in camp two times a week and ever since her hair has been more like a doll&#x27;s hair. It was always so soft and beautiful and the chemicals changed it. It&#x27;s been 2 years since that camp and her hair was STILL like that! Never going back to its natural, soft beauty. I was SO sad. We signed up for some serious swimming at our gym and I added in the 5 yr old this time. We swam 4-5 times a week. I started using this shampoo after every swim and not only did we all keep our hair in great shape, but my oldest daughters hair is actually going back to its original soft sweetness!! I don&#x27;t know and can&#x27;t day for sure if it&#x27;s this shampoo. Too many variables since 2 years have passed since the sever damage, BUT, she has long hair, so it&#x27;s not all new hair growth and it was still terrible, plastic-like and horrible to brush every day since that fateful swim summer. All I know is tha since we&#x27;ve been using this, my hair, the little one&#x27;s hair and her hair have been perfectly normal, and in her case, repaired. It&#x27;s at about 90% back to its original shape fromTWO years ago. Crazy, right? Plus this shampoo is so cheap, I hardly expected this miracle from it. I&#x27;ve also started washing out our swimsuits with it to save the color and material. Seems to work well!!</li>
            <li> This is a great followup product to be used with it&#x27;s shampoo mate after swimming in a chlorine or salt water pool. It prevents drying and other hair damage perfectly. I keep a stock of it because I never want to run out.</li>
            <li> bought for friend she likes very much</li>
            <li> It works and arrived on time</li>
            <li> best shampoo i have found to remove chlorine from my children&#x27;s hair after long summer days swimming. i love this product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for chlorine hair!!  This made my son&#x27;s hair go from awful and frizzy to nice and smooth and shiny again!</li>
            <li> I am a Triathlete Coach and I swim 5 days a week. I am usually in the pool 2 hours each day. I have used Ultra Swim for a long time. It keeps my hair in great condition. Chlorine can make your hair brittle and strip the color. Ultra Swim prevents all the harsh side effects that chlorine can have on your hair. I have recommended it to my athletes and they are all using it as well.</li>
            <li> We have had an Endless Pool for many years, my wife and I swim three days a week. We use Chlorine in the pool and it used to damage our hair, making it dry and stiff. We use just a little bit of the UltraSwim in the shower per instructions after swimming and it neutralizes the chlorine in our hair leaving it soft and healthy; and it smells nice, not perfumed but clean and nice. Now we can swim and go off to work without being so concerned about our hair.</li>
            <li> We live in Southern California and the kids seem to spend the whole summer in pools and Chlorine .  This is particuarly hard on long hair for girls and so once we found this shampoo (and the accompanying conditioner) we keep it in stock and use it constantly.  It makes a huge difference in the condition of their hair.  We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My daughter swims on a team and her hair gets very chlorine saturated.  It starts to look like doll hair.  If she uses the UltraSwim regularly this doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> How do you ever know if a product really works?  I&#x27;m not sure but I can say that as a (almost) daily swimmer, my hair stays in good condition and the gray doesn&#x27;t have a greenish cast as some blonds and grays take on....when exposed to chlorine.  It has a pleasant perfume and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> Makes a noticeable difference in hair softener.  Even better when combined with Ultra Swim Conditioner. Amazon price point is very good.</li>
            <li> I needed to find something to get the chlorine out of my hair so I don&#x27;t lose the color in my treated hair, this product does just what it says, I also got the conditioner and they both make your hair smell good and nice and soft</li>
            <li> I was told my hair does not smell like chlorine anymore so the product does what it advertises. However you will still need to use a conditioner to make your hair soft after swimming. Also if you need a special shampoo for your hair you will still need to use it as this product ONLY REMOVES THE CHLORINE FROM YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> this stuff works at our pool, it removes the smell and straw like feeling in hair, being in a 4 pack I dont have to remember to order as often</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner before I go swimming and it helps my hair tremendously. I still wear a cap to keep my hair from moving around and getting tangled. The cap combined with the conditioner is perfect. I aslo use the shampoo and conditioner after I swim and they are great.</li>
            <li> I always used Aloe Rid to take the chlorine out if my hair and my kids hair. I panicked when it was discontinued. We have very fine hair and even though mine doesn&#x27;t turn green (just my 2 blonde girls), it would feel like straw. Salons recommended Paul Mitchell Shampoo 1. Smells great and nice shampoo but does not remove chlorine. UltraSwim removes it with one shampooing and is unbelievably priced low at Amazon.com. I paid almost as much for 1 bottle at my local pharmacy as I did for 4 bottles at Amazon. We all have silky hair and I have more money in my wallet.</li>
            <li> My husband swims 5 days a week at the Y and he has gray hair. He uses this shampoo and it really keeps the yellow out from the chlorine. Don&#x27;t know what we would do without it and the price is right!</li>
            <li> I swim 5-7times a week.  I wear a cap however my hair still gets wet.  As a result my hair has gotten very dry regardless of the shampoo/conditioning treatment that I do.  I decided to give this a try with very low expectations.  I absolutely love this shampoo!  It has made a world of difference in my hair. It is back to being soft again after my conditioning treatment.  I only need to use the ultra swim shampoo and use a different conditioner.  I wish I had tried this years ago. My hairdresser saw the difference as well and was impressed with the results especially since it was not a \\&quot;salon\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have bought it twice.. It washes out the chlorine pretty good. Will continue to buy it</li>
            <li> Best chlorine removal shampoo it gets it all out in one wash and I use it everyday and have never had a problem</li>
            <li> In addition to removing pool chlorine, it leaves hair clean and silky.</li>
            <li> I swim every day and all of a sudden started getting an itchy rash.  I use this product as a shampoo, body wash, and swim suit detergent!</li>
            <li> This is the best Chlorine shampoo we have every found.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I can find this shampoo.  With light-haired grandchildren, this works great to keep the chlorine green and straw feel out of the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. My kids were taking daily swim lessons and after a few weeks, their hair was turning to straw. After the first wash, I noticed a remarkable difference. After the second wash, my 6 year old&#x27;s long, thick hair could easily be combed thru after her baths. I don&#x27;t even swim in chlorine and used it on myself a few times and it really seemed to strip all the buildup off my hair. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as stated.  Helps to remove the chlorine and the chlorine smell from your hair.  Even though it says it&#x27;s hydrating be careful with using it too often as I did find it to be a little drying when I used it two days in a row.</li>
            <li> use to obtain this product from Walgreens, but it was discontinued in the Madison area, so went to the computer.  I swim three times a week in a pool, using chlorine.</li>
            <li> Its very good for all who like to swim.</li>
            <li> Very good product at a good price.  This product can be difficult to find on some store shelves.  My wife uses this after swimming in the pool, so it&#x27;s important that we have it available to get out the cholrine.  Getting it here in quantity makes life simple.  The product does an excellent job.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> We swim non stop in the summer in the pool.  This shampoo really does take the chlorine out.  After I use it, my hair smell wonderful and it is some what conditioned too.  It conditions better on my three children ages 7, 11, and 14.  I use the Ultra Swim condition in addition on my hair only and it does seem to do a fairly good job of conditioning my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot, but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; up, which for my children make it a little harder to know how much to use.  Easy fix is to show the older ones and apply it to my younger one.  The price was better than at the local drugstore and it came when promised.  I would definitely recommend this shampoo for swimmers who swim in pools.</li>
            <li> Very good for swimmers as well as other people who use normal mineral water. I am not swimmer but i use it and get good result.</li>
            <li> I swim 3-4 days a week and 6-7 in the summer. This shampoo is great at helping get the chlorine out</li>
            <li> No chlorine smell at all after washing my hair with this stuff. I swim five days a week and I love this shampoo, it feels moisturizing and completely removes the chlorine smell from my hair.</li>
            <li> I do not know what I would do without it. I pair it with the UltraSwim conditioner after every swim. It has kept my hair manageable.</li>
            <li> My daughter swims 6 days a week and had frizzy dry, chlorine smelling hair for the longest time.  After a few days of using this shampoo, she has noticed significant improvement in her hair.  Now after several weeks, she loves this shampoo.  She likes that her hair is soft, manageable and no chlorine smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and clean...no conditioner needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many swim caps with no luck.  And as a moderately frequent swimmer (2x week) I was really struggling with my hair.  UltraSwim is so simple and really works.  No chemical smell, no floral or overpowering smell.  One wash after swimming and the chlorine is really gone.  In fact, last time I was at the beauty parlor, my hairdresser asked me why I had stopped swimming - she had made an assumption based on my hair.  I was glad to tell her she was wrong, I am still swimming.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my three swim club teens. Their hair kept getting a green tint and always smelled of chlorine. This product really works. Their hair, two very fine and one thick, is left soft and no trace of chlorine smell. However we did find that if this product is not rinsed out properly it will leave your hair with a crispy coating.</li>
            <li> Great for swimmers, perfect size, and very reasonably priced.  Works great to help keep the chlorine out of hair and keep it healthy looking.</li>
            <li> My daughter is on a swim team and is in chlorine 4-5 days a week. After trying a variety of shampoos, this one is the best! Her hair is never dry, brittle, or dull. People often comment that they can&#x27;t believe she has such long, shiny hair when she spends so much time in the pool! This multi-pack was a great deal - it&#x27;s so great to have extras in the house!</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans some of the chlorine out of my hair but not all.  Even during multiple shampoos.  I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> Have used this to hand-wash a swimsuit used for water aerobics.  Really like the scent afterwards - and no hint of chlorine.  But I will have to use it over several weeks in order to see if it keeps my suit from shredding.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo since 5 or 6 years and find it the only kind that gets out the chlorine well. It also is economical in use. Buying it online is way cheaper then in the store.</li>
            <li> I swim daily and need this product (along with the conditioner) to get the chlorine out of my hair.  My barber says the condition of my hair has improved dramatically since I began using them both.</li>
            <li> After swimming, my hair would smell like chlorine for a couple of days.  This shampoo removes it after just one use!  I would  recommend using the UltraSwim Conditioner with it.  Together, they really help limit some of the damage done by the chlorine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as shampoo, I use it as body wash.  I try to not get my hair wet in the pool, so the chlorine in my hair isn&#x27;t a problem.  This works well as a body wash to remove the chlorine from your skin (helps to prevent itchy dry skin from the chlorine &amp; water).</li>
            <li> i hate all the harsh chemicals in this, but without another option for removing the chlorine from my kids&#x27; hair we have been using this.  seems to work well.  i hate the scent -- too artificial.</li>
            <li> This really does work and gets the chlorine right out of your hair and gets it back on track. Wish they had a body wash!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good experiences using this product in the past, and now that I&#x27;m back in the pool again (4x a week), regular shampoo/conditioner just doesn&#x27;t cut it, especially in the chlorine smell department. While conditioner is a must afterwards, this product makes a great shampoo and body wash, and left no discernible smell behind after over an hour in the pool. A+, I&#x27;m glad I bought the four pack!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I swim at the local YMCA regularly and I&#x27;m convinced they use pure Clorox because that pool has so much chlorine in there I can barely breathe. (I&#x27;m Joking, I know they don&#x27;t use actual Clorox chlorine).  Even after showering and shampooing twice, I would still smell like the pool all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as smell goes, this stuff is great.  It really gets rid of the chlorine smell from my hair and body (didn&#x27;t do anything to help the suit).  BUT it feels like a really harsh stripping shampoo.  Maybe because I&#x27;ve got really curly hair and I need extra moisturizing?  But I&#x27;m not getting the \\&quot;softness\\&quot; that others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I find this stuff really liquid.  I know, it&#x27;s a liquid, duh.  But when I shampoo and condition, I pour the product into my hand before placing it on my hair so I can control the amount of product.  As soon as I squirt it into my cupped hand, it runs right trough my fingers.  It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m just using water.  I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo or conditioner (or body wash for that matter) that runs like this.  I feel like it is a waste and I end up using more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the lines of using more - it doesn&#x27;t foam up like normal shampoo, so I find I have to use extra product to get it to cover my whole head.  Or maybe it is just because the product is so diluted that it isn&#x27;t as effective?  Ditto with the conditioner.  This combined with the diluted nature means I&#x27;m going through a whole bottle a week (compared to one per month for my regular shampoo) for my just past shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Gets rid of chlorine smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t help texture of curly hair - makes it frizzier&lt;br /&gt;* Very dilute - half of it runs down the drain&lt;br /&gt;* Need to use more (than regular shampoo) to get results&lt;br /&gt;* Because of last two concerns, you end up going through the bottles faster - so not cost effective</li>
            <li> Great shampoo not only for swimmers. I have white hair and it strips the pollution that yellows it and adds a nice shine. Also great to soak my suits after a swim in the pool.</li>
            <li> good chlorine removal shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years. I have brown hair so I&#x27;m not sure how it helps blondes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to use every once in a while just for a clarifier even if I haven&#x27;t swam lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use it after a swim and never have pinestraw hair. It smells good also.</li>
            <li> Great product! It does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Just awesome.  Use all the time - even when I&#x27;m taking a hiatus from swimming.  Great for dry hair and works like a charm on chlorine.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected! Can &#x27;t find it anywhere but here and one other swim site.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. My son swims for 2 1/2 hours 6 days aweek. We found this shampoo and it takes the chlorine smell out of his hair and it also softens his hair as well. Great product.</li>
            <li> I purchase this pretty regularly. I love the shampoo and the fact that you get 4 at a time. And UltraSwim always ships in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I swim a lot and this product is very effective in getting chlorine out of your hair.  I have been using it for years but frequently have a problem finding it in my local drug store.  The on line price is less than the drug store down the street.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like straw after swimming 4-5 days a week for a month. I had previously used run-of-the-mill garnier fructis shampoo. After 2-3 days my hair was almost back to normal. Still not exactly the same as if I didn&#x27;t swim but far, far better. Definitely worth the purchase IMO.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did not work for me as the other reviews stated.  I even used it with their chlorine removing conditioner specified. Possibly the public pools (in Las Vegas) carry more chlorine than other -I don&#x27;t know.  But this shampoo with their conditioner did little to help save my hair.  I returned it.  Thank you Amazon for being so wonderful on your product guarantee.</li>
            <li> Works well and delivery was right on time</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this products cause it has such good reviews on it. I gave it a try and it seems to wash my hair ok but it made my hair tangle and so dry. If you use this please use it with other conditioner. Ultraswim conditioner make my hair really dry and not soft and silky like it claims.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find something to take the green out of my little girl&#x27;s hair.  She swims 2 or 3 times a day.  this just didn&#x27;t work.  It is a nice enough shampoo but I still need to use vinegar to get the green out and then I use a shampoo and moisturizing conditioner.</li>
