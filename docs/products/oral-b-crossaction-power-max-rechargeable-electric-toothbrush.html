            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the product.</li>

            <li>I am so thrilled with this great bargain of a toothbrush!</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is great, the charge lasts for about a week, and it&#x27;s keeping our teeth in great shape.  </li>
            <li>Got it and is has been great.</li>

            <li>We love it!!</li>
            <li>Good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li>This product is good for teeth cleaning and the charging feature is very nice.</li>
            <li>But i was pleasantly surpised.</li>
            <li>As ever, a good product from Oral-B.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d not have opened this, I already have a sonicare toothbrush, works just as good for cleaning, just doesn&#x27;t remove stains like the prophy brush does.</li>
            <li>best offer available..     </li>
            <li>Feel my teeth get a good cleaning with the dual-action brushing.  </li>
            <li>The price was really good</li>
            <li>This usually is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels so good after brushing with this.</li>
            <li>Good price, and dependable.</li>
            <li>It is good for me to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good entry level rechargeable electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Holds charge for 2 weeks plus and cleans good.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years and have been happy with them.  </li>
            <li>This was so great that I got 4 more for relatives.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I also found that my Cross-Action rechargeable effectively died after about five years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did--it&#x27;s much superior.  </li>
            <li>The battery is good and it lasts more than a week when it is charged one time.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work great, but it had a great price!</li>
            <li>Liked it</li>
            <li>I really liked my Sonic brush, but can&#x27;t find it or replacement brushheads anymore.  </li>
            <li>For a nice effect after brushing rinse the brush with Hydrogen Peroxide and brush with that.    </li>
            <li>own toothbrush just like this for around 8 to 10 years...</li>
            <li>Great tooth brush with replacement brushes easily available at most any store.  </li>
            <li>I already own a Oral B electric toothbrush and i am very happy with the cleaning action.</li>
            <li>Being from the Cincinnati area originally, I use a lot of Proctor and Gamble products and for the most part been happy with them.  </li>
            <li>I got a great deal on it (about $8), so I&#x27;m definitely happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li>but its great and so worth the money.</li>
            <li>This tootbrush works great and price was right.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to hold while brushing.</li>
            <li>I liked the bristle motion on the Crest Spin way better, but this one is fine.</li>
            <li>The brush has a rotating action in the front part of the brush which is very good for cleaning one&#x27;s tongues.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a smaller teeth brush than your teeth for a best cleaning quality.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Works well - cleans the teeth and battery charge holds for more than a week.</li>
            <li>So it gets 4 stars for not providing more information about the product.</li>
            <li>Overall product quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a couple of years now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>When I got it, I was more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>It may be best to purchase the product from a local pharmacy then to purchase it on line.  </li>
            <li>No reason to spend more, this brush delivers.</li>
            <li>but I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I almost gave this four stars because I have a $100 oral b brush that is way better than this.</li>
            <li>and this is way better.</li>
            <li>I think that it moves around ok</li>
            <li>I figured that it&#x27;ll be able to swivel it out...</li>
            <li>But if you are going to pay more than 10</li>
            <li>Also, I read that you don&#x27;t have to recharge that many times to get it to work...</li>
            <li>HE&#x27;S SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>This was a gift that didn&#x27;t get used much but the price and shipping was great.</li>
            <li>The are many pros and cons about tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li>you like - the more</li>
            <li>When I typed oh-ral B that is a non-to-subtle way to indicate that it is better than a stick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothbrush for many months.</li>
            <li>This product was just okay.</li>
            <li>(Or just throw more batteries into the landfill.)</li>
            <li>What more do I have to say?</li>
            <li>Perhaps there are better devices, but not for this price.</li>
            <li>I have been using oral-B for more than 1 year.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stop making this toothbrush!! :)</li>
            <li>It cleans more than mannual brushteeth.</li>
            <li>Bristles are way too hard--Oral B should know better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to spend the money on this.</li>
            <li>It has really made my teeth look and feel great.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the Crest Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It was very worth it!</li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean and seem whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a pretty good tooth brush.</li>
            <li>but other than that, the brush does what its supposed to do, awesome cross movement, great quality bristles and good power.</li>
            <li>i would say this toothbrush would easily cost $25 or more but for $11?</li>
            <li>And remember what the doctor says: Clean your teeth 3 times a day, 5 minutes each!</li>
            <li>5) Clean your tounge and gums!  </li>
            <li>Seems to do a good job and the head isn&#x27;t to large.</li>
            <li>No such tool came with it, nor is this incredible trademarked tool indicated on the diagram in the instructions.  </li>
            <li>an important tool in keeping my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>so it can be easily carried around.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans and feels like a toothbrush that could easily cost 5x as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stand up easily in the charger and wasn&#x27;t convenient  to keep on sink.</li>
            <li>I like the strength it produces and it is easy to charge.</li>
            <li>You can easily get the replacement heads at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a long time does a very good job</li>
            <li>This is a very good electric toothbrush with some unique features relative to others in the market.</li>
            <li>However, this may be my own problem because I do have gums that are more sensitive than most people.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still very reasonably priced, and has the most power, but you pay a dollar more or so for each replacement brush.</li>
            <li>five years for a $15 unit is fine--</li>
            <li>Having said that, for the money, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.     </li>
            <li>the charging station doesn&#x27;t have a light or anything</li>
            <li>, hope it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for a cheap electric toothbrush that gets the job done, then this is for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This works fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are cheap as well.  </li>
            <li>I CAN&#x27;T SAY ENOUGH HOW HAPPY SHE IS WITH THIS  PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush has a good up-and-down action, to get in those, cracks and cranies, of you&#x27;r teeth.   </li>
            <li>Easy to replace but need the special tool that it comes with.</li>
            <li>Very nice second to my primary toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is very good and comparable to other costly brushes.</li>
            <li>It was very affordable also!!!</li>
            <li>I honestly feel like I&#x27;ve been in for a mini-cleaning at the dentist after using this particular brush</li>
            <li>(With any of these, you have to be aware that the real cost is in the brush heads, which cost $4-6 each; you get a good deal on the unit because you&#x27;re locked into buying the heads.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the purchase and recommend it to anyone interested in a quality product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first electric toothbrush I bought, at a Dentist&#x27;s recommendation that I get one, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine another brush, electric or otherwise, doing a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This being my first electric toothbrush, I find it to be ok.</li>
            <li>I thought it worked well originally</li>
            <li>Awesome value...works better than more expensive toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>That being said, I was looking for something like a rubber prophy brush like what they use to clean your teeth at the dentist.</li>
            <li>Its such a good toothbrush I was nervous because it was so cheap</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it doesn&#x27;t clean the teeth</li>
            <li>Okay so i bought this toothbrush from Walmart... seemed like a reasonable price for an electric tooth brush with a free charger...    </li>
            <li>Remember to replace the brush head and clean that area where the head connects.    </li>
            <li>It is wonderfull to clean teeth.</li>
            <li>toothbrush works well and leaves my mouth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li>My wife has a ORAL B 3000 series, and hers has a special lower speed on it for the more sensitive teeth, and that is a much better toothbrush, I want to buy one like hers, but for now until I get that money, I&#x27;ll stick to my $5 toothbrushes....</li>
            <li>Originally I would have given the toothbrush a 5 star - did a nice job cleaning my teeth, held a charge, wasn&#x27;t too loud.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I only paid 5 dollars for this item, I&#x27;m gonna say that a 3 star rating is good.</li>
            <li>This is replacing another Oral-B pulsating rechargeable brush that I loved and used for over 4 years that finally died.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and get a good one...</li>
            <li>I looked for a replacement handle for the Oral-B Professional Care that we had had for years and liked.</li>
            <li>Overall a good electric toothbrush in this price.</li>
            <li>It works fabulously and charges right on my sink.</li>
            <li>I love my new oral B!</li>
            <li>The instructions tell you to use the \\&quot;quick release tool\\&quot; to remove the brushhead.  </li>
            <li>There is a soft bristle version available, I think, but it was like $6 more or something ...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even do a better job than a normal toothbrush.     </li>
            <li>At only $12 I felt like I had nothing to lose and to give it a shot, and my teeth are very glad I did.    </li>
            <li>First time to use a electric toothbrush, have to say I really enjoy using it</li>
            <li>My older toothbrush seemed to be more powerful, but I don&#x27;t mind this one.  </li>
            <li>I love the the electrics for the kids too, because I know how long they&#x27;ve been brushing by the sound - without standing over them!</li>
            <li>First of all, I can&#x27;t believe Amazon sell toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>For the most part, I have been most pleased with my Amazon purchases over the past 12 years, but this purchase makes me feel I&#x27;ve been had.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with my new brush.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the fact that it isn&#x27;t quite as powerful could sometimes be a plus.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>weak,not worth the money</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Holds a powerful charge for about 5 days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Double-action really is good for getting into small spaces (top of the brush) or just buffing and general cleaning (back of the brush)&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable in the hand and the mouth -- the brush itself isn&#x27;t too large and the grip is soft and fits my hand perfectly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size unlike</li>
            <li>The battery is great, charging station is small</li>
            <li>It is surely a good deal for less than 5.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are cheap, and it gets my teeth white, and they feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace it, as it looked to be as good, but for less money for the toothbrush and for refills.  </li>
            <li>It really packs a punch and has more action than my retired brush.</li>
            <li>The battery type are great for only a short time.  </li>
            <li>Great tooth brush, just hard to find replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Even though the toothbrush was still working fine, I eventually tossed it and got a new one once the ick factor was too much to deal with.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not in love with is the battery.</li>
            <li>But when I first started using it</li>
            <li>Since there is no timer, you have to make sure that you are brushing equally all the sides.     </li>
            <li>I had an Oral B crossaction for many years and it finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>but most of them were so big to handle.  </li>
            <li>, just be aware that there&#x27;s a trick to replacing the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>of course I flossed first, but still....</li>
            <li>I use it twice everyday and it does hold a pretty good charge.</li>
            <li>Have had this for several weeks and for the price have never had a better one.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied - especially for the cost.    </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t remember exactly,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to go back to using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Just make sure the first time you charge it you don&#x27;t unplug it or take it off in the middle of the 24 hour charge.</li>
            <li>I noticed how much whiter his teeth were!</li>
            <li>A simple straight forward mechanism with good brushing action.</li>
            <li>As usual, quick shipment via Amazon, along with a reasonable price for a good product.</li>
            <li>If I time it right I can find replacement heads on sale so these have not been a real problem.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great brush for the price and highly recommended over a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>There is only one setting, but it&#x27;s adequate for effective teeth cleaning and fine for a few days away from home.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Like pretty much all rechargeable toothbrushes, this uses induction to charge the battery.  </li>
            <li>noticed the battery not holding charge as long any more.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush has a long battery life - I disconnected the charger to see how long it would go and it lasted more than a week, so it is good for short trips.</li>
            <li>When the brush is worn out, most of the time cheaper in the long run to replace the whole unit that trying to find the replacement brush.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t changed out the heads yet, but it looks easy enough.  </li>
            <li>Easy enough to time brushing length myself.</li>
            <li>I got it as an alternative travel brush instead of taking my 3000 smart series when I am traveling.     </li>
            <li>, I think its pure value for money.</li>
            <li>I really did not expect much from this brush as it was at a lower price range compared to smart series brushes.</li>
            <li>The brush is too big, but for my big mouth it fit just fine.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B has a special tool included whenever you, firstly, buy the brush, and secondly buy replacement heads.</li>
            <li>She wanted something gentle and this definitely does the job and feels comfortable in your mouth.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner using this toothbrush than with my manual one.</li>
            <li>You really feel that it cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a gimmick without any real cleaning function, so I&#x27;d leave that out of the equation.  </li>
            <li>That really adds up unless you use rechargeable batteries.  </li>
            <li>They should be replaced three or four times a year (your mileage may vary), so you&#x27;ll pay as much for the brush heads in a year as you&#x27;ll pay for the unit.)  </li>
            <li>I feel like it really makes a difference in the quality of your brushing.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done and if you lose it then you don&#x27;t have to pay too much for a replacement.</li>
            <li>It said in the description that \\&quot;Rubberized bristles help gently polish away</li>
            <li>However, I bought this brush for my sister because she doesn&#x27;t believe in spending that much for a tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Much louder than the Vitality.  </li>
            <li>This means that the charger is using up just as much electricity as it would use to charge it whenever it&#x27;s plugged in, whether the battery needs charging, or the toothbrush is even holstered, or not.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, this one only uses a couple watts, according to my kill-a-watt and the documentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an inexpensive electric toothbrush that handles very well when I travel.  </li>
            <li>They seem to keep a charge and they are slender enough for them to hold comfortably.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s a reasonable price, and that it&#x27;s electric, not battery-operated.</li>
            <li>really works well like</li>
            <li>This experience is very discouraging.</li>
            <li>Over the past 12 years I have purchased two or three electric toothbrushes from Amazon and have been very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>It really holds charge for three months.</li>
            <li>The rechargeable feature is very  convienent.</li>
            <li>My son wants one just like mine</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t break completely, but stopped having enough power to use, maybe because the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge any more.  </li>
            <li>I bought the original one from Amazon, a letter came from P &amp; G and the second one was sent from another company.    </li>
            <li>My dentist visits are significantly shorter now that I upgraded from a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The one thing is you have to apply little bit more energy with this brush than with smart series ones.</li>
            <li>He has no problems with taking it with him because the charger is small and fits into his bag nicely.</li>
            <li>The one main disadvantages with this brush is the lack of a timer.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t a lot of information on their site for this particular model, and the seller didn&#x27;t specify either.</li>
            <li>It did take me, a male, a good few years before I got the hang of how to change the heads.</li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing this brush, my first one got lost, if you looking to spend few dollars and get amazing results then  buy this brush.</li>
            <li>Not suitable for couples or families that each want their own brush but share the handle.</li>
            <li>The brush is the same as the ones with replaceable batteries, but this lets you use a fully charged brush everytime, whereas normally performance quickly tapers off after each battery change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Great cleaning power, high revolutions per</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this toothbrush..</li>
            <li>I should say I was pleasantly surprised by this!!</li>
            <li>No complaint there--</li>
            <li>All in all though I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the price especially if you&#x27;re a college age kid or going on vacation.</li>
            <li>Only possible disadvantage is that the head is not that easy to change (you get a plastic tool when you buy replacement heads).  </li>
            <li>I normally feel comfortable with items been sold directly from Amazon, however, in this case I received an empty box.</li>
            <li>LIKE A KID WITH A NEW TOY.,IT</li>
            <li>/&gt;Had them for over a year now and still works like new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only spent $3 on this.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a real complaint exactly, it just kind of worries me.</li>
            <li>First, I haven&#x27;t found any advantage to using the Cross-Action heads, which have a second set of bristles in addition to the spinning brush.  </li>
            <li>If you are interested in trying a automatic brush and you cannot afford brushes at $100, I would definitely recommend this to you!!</li>
            <li>but this does work better than the small brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would last 2 weeks, but it definitely does last more than a week.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much he would use it, but a few days later we were having dinner and</li>
            <li>This was my first electric toothbrush after a very long time and I am surprised how much they have improved.</li>
            <li>some other power toothbrushes(i had the dual clean before and</li>
            <li>The battery charge lasts a long time even though the brush is slender and light relative to the competing electric brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall, just amazingly, astonishingly ... average.    </li>
            <li>He has been a smoker for over 10 years and is pretty self conscious about his teeth being yellow.</li>
            <li>This was the first time purchasing a Oral-B CrossAction Rechareable Power toothbush on line and was very dissapointted as I went back to using a regular tooth bush.</li>
            <li>So I went back to my regular toothbrush and got the job done in a quick second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cuz had it so long, but its been 4ever since i owned any other toothbrush...still works fine, but probably was going to break soon, a few cracks in in plastic brush cover after so many years of usage, taking it on and off.</li>
            <li>I would steer clear of this product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Need to pop the head off and clean it frequently, as the previous reviewer mentioned.  </li>
            <li>I use rechargeable batteries instead of the power stand, but haven&#x27;t had any problems with the brush at all so far.</li>
            <li>When I came across an updated version of my old one - I immediately bought it.  </li>
            <li>Cons: LOUD.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ve been at college for nearly a month now and the oral b has served me well.</li>
            <li>so if your sensitive it might hurt..</li>
            <li>, however I still find that there is a limitation on how far it can go in my mouth.</li>
            <li>So far I like what I got and would recommend it</li>
            <li>but the girlfriend hates the loud whirring it creates when I start brushing at 5am.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s LOUD.  </li>
            <li>review is for the Oral-B CrossAction Power Max Whitening Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, marked Type 3733.</li>
            <li>so far my gums look a lot healthier..</li>
            <li>This electric tooth brush is just too loud to use.  </li>
            <li>The complaints in this forum are all valid: Yes, it is loud.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s louder than my electric razor, not as loud as my hair clippers.</li>
            <li>I paid around 5 dollars for this brush so the pro exceeds the con by far.</li>
            <li>I use xylitol based tooth paste with baking soda in it to avoid cavities, and so far i have not noticed any detrimentatal effect of baking soda on the plastic of the brush.</li>
            <li>This makes your teeth far cleaner.</li>
            <li>The battery last long too after a full charge.</li>
            <li>In the past when I worked at the dentist, if I had staining I would just brush my teeth with the power prophy brush and it would easily remove the stain.</li>
            <li>but uh i only wish they made it silent so no disturbing peace</li>
            <li>I leave it in the base almost all the time, why place it on the counter top when it has a nice little holder right?</li>
            <li>Oral-B Cross Action Power Max Whitening!!    </li>
            <li>Went back to my normal toothbrush after about a week.</li>
            <li>but I would definitely recommend this as it cleans very well for only a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At least you can view what you are actually purchasing and can check to make sure all the items are included and working correctly and get a return on your investment.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is less powerful than some competitors.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my younger sibling (13 years old at the time) but was surprised when I opened up the package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: If you buy this brush, barring major catastrophes that some others have had, you won&#x27;t go to anything else.</li>
            <li>If you have hard teeth, this brush would work fine for you...</li>
            <li>B00336EUSQ Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Toothpaste Radiant Mint Flavor, 5.8-Ounce Carton (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li>so I have no other one to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>What a fantastic little cordless toothbrush!!</li>
            <li>It feels flimsy and only the very top of the toothbrush (bristles) are exchangeable (and it&#x27;s quite difficult).</li>
            <li>The Cross Action Rechargeable did not include a Power replacement brush and when I made an attempt to replace the bushhead it would not slide the brushhead off the toothbush, even when you push the QuickRelease tool on the neck as shown by the instructions.</li>
            <li>However with cross action technology I can glide over my teeth and let the brush do the work.  </li>
            <li>The cross action tooth brush I ordered June 23 was a replacement for one I had for 2 months and stopped working.  </li>
            <li>My old one was finally wearing out,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>The rechargeable Cross-Action costs a bit more, uses replacement heads that cost a little less than the single spinning brush heads, and has more power than the battery operated model, but less power than the single brush model.  </li>
            <li>Replacement brushes are also not super expensive, which is a great selling point.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for several years at least, and it still works fine.  </li>
            <li>I instantly got this because I was in need of a new brush and this happened to $4.77, I was all up on that since a regular brush is about the same price.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend only used it for a couple of months and went back to his old tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It did not clean any better than a regular plain non motorized toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Yeah, replacing the toothbrush head requires a little plastic tool, but it&#x27;s really a miniminal addition.  </li>
            <li>The top half of the brush spins while the bottom half goes up and down.  </li>

            <li> Good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> This product is good for teeth cleaning and the charging feature is very nice.</li>
            <li> But i was pleasantly surpised.</li>
            <li> As ever, a good product from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d not have opened this, I already have a sonicare toothbrush, works just as good for cleaning, just doesn&#x27;t remove stains like the prophy brush does.</li>
            <li> best offer available..     </li>
            <li> Feel my teeth get a good cleaning with the dual-action brushing.  </li>
            <li> The price was really good</li>
            <li> This usually is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels so good after brushing with this.</li>
            <li> Good price, and dependable.</li>
            <li> It is good for me to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good entry level rechargeable electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for 2 weeks plus and cleans good.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years and have been happy with them.  </li>
            <li> This was so great that I got 4 more for relatives.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I also found that my Cross-Action rechargeable effectively died after about five years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did--it&#x27;s much superior.  </li>
            <li> The battery is good and it lasts more than a week when it is charged one time.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work great, but it had a great price!</li>
            <li> Liked it</li>
            <li> I really liked my Sonic brush, but can&#x27;t find it or replacement brushheads anymore.  </li>
            <li> For a nice effect after brushing rinse the brush with Hydrogen Peroxide and brush with that.    </li>
            <li> own toothbrush just like this for around 8 to 10 years...</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush with replacement brushes easily available at most any store.  </li>
            <li> I already own a Oral B electric toothbrush and i am very happy with the cleaning action.</li>
            <li> Being from the Cincinnati area originally, I use a lot of Proctor and Gamble products and for the most part been happy with them.  </li>
            <li> I got a great deal on it (about $8), so I&#x27;m definitely happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li> but its great and so worth the money.</li>
            <li> This tootbrush works great and price was right.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to hold while brushing.</li>
            <li> I liked the bristle motion on the Crest Spin way better, but this one is fine.</li>
            <li> The brush has a rotating action in the front part of the brush which is very good for cleaning one&#x27;s tongues.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a smaller teeth brush than your teeth for a best cleaning quality.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Works well - cleans the teeth and battery charge holds for more than a week.</li>
            <li> So it gets 4 stars for not providing more information about the product.</li>
            <li> Overall product quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a couple of years now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> When I got it, I was more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> It may be best to purchase the product from a local pharmacy then to purchase it on line.  </li>
            <li> No reason to spend more, this brush delivers.</li>
            <li> but I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I almost gave this four stars because I have a $100 oral b brush that is way better than this.</li>
            <li> and this is way better.</li>
            <li> I think that it moves around ok</li>
            <li> I figured that it&#x27;ll be able to swivel it out...</li>
            <li> But if you are going to pay more than 10</li>
            <li> Also, I read that you don&#x27;t have to recharge that many times to get it to work...</li>
            <li> HE&#x27;S SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> This was a gift that didn&#x27;t get used much but the price and shipping was great.</li>
            <li> The are many pros and cons about tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> you like - the more</li>
            <li> When I typed oh-ral B that is a non-to-subtle way to indicate that it is better than a stick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for many months.</li>
            <li> This product was just okay.</li>
            <li> (Or just throw more batteries into the landfill.)</li>
            <li> What more do I have to say?</li>
            <li> Perhaps there are better devices, but not for this price.</li>
            <li> I have been using oral-B for more than 1 year.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stop making this toothbrush!! :)</li>
            <li> It cleans more than mannual brushteeth.</li>
            <li> Bristles are way too hard--Oral B should know better.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to spend the money on this.</li>
            <li> It has really made my teeth look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the Crest Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It was very worth it!</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean and seem whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a pretty good tooth brush.</li>
            <li> but other than that, the brush does what its supposed to do, awesome cross movement, great quality bristles and good power.</li>
            <li> i would say this toothbrush would easily cost $25 or more but for $11?</li>
            <li> And remember what the doctor says: Clean your teeth 3 times a day, 5 minutes each!</li>
            <li> 5) Clean your tounge and gums!  </li>
            <li> Seems to do a good job and the head isn&#x27;t to large.</li>
            <li> No such tool came with it, nor is this incredible trademarked tool indicated on the diagram in the instructions.  </li>
            <li> an important tool in keeping my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> so it can be easily carried around.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans and feels like a toothbrush that could easily cost 5x as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stand up easily in the charger and wasn&#x27;t convenient  to keep on sink.</li>
            <li> I like the strength it produces and it is easy to charge.</li>
            <li> You can easily get the replacement heads at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time does a very good job</li>
            <li> This is a very good electric toothbrush with some unique features relative to others in the market.</li>
            <li> However, this may be my own problem because I do have gums that are more sensitive than most people.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still very reasonably priced, and has the most power, but you pay a dollar more or so for each replacement brush.</li>
            <li> five years for a $15 unit is fine--</li>
            <li> Having said that, for the money, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.     </li>
            <li> the charging station doesn&#x27;t have a light or anything</li>
            <li> , hope it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a cheap electric toothbrush that gets the job done, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This works fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are cheap as well.  </li>
            <li> I CAN&#x27;T SAY ENOUGH HOW HAPPY SHE IS WITH THIS  PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush has a good up-and-down action, to get in those, cracks and cranies, of you&#x27;r teeth.   </li>
            <li> Easy to replace but need the special tool that it comes with.</li>
            <li> Very nice second to my primary toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is very good and comparable to other costly brushes.</li>
            <li> It was very affordable also!!!</li>
            <li> I honestly feel like I&#x27;ve been in for a mini-cleaning at the dentist after using this particular brush</li>
            <li> (With any of these, you have to be aware that the real cost is in the brush heads, which cost $4-6 each; you get a good deal on the unit because you&#x27;re locked into buying the heads.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the purchase and recommend it to anyone interested in a quality product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first electric toothbrush I bought, at a Dentist&#x27;s recommendation that I get one, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine another brush, electric or otherwise, doing a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This being my first electric toothbrush, I find it to be ok.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked well originally</li>
            <li> Awesome value...works better than more expensive toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> That being said, I was looking for something like a rubber prophy brush like what they use to clean your teeth at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Its such a good toothbrush I was nervous because it was so cheap</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it doesn&#x27;t clean the teeth</li>
            <li> Okay so i bought this toothbrush from Walmart... seemed like a reasonable price for an electric tooth brush with a free charger...    </li>
            <li> Remember to replace the brush head and clean that area where the head connects.    </li>
            <li> It is wonderfull to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> toothbrush works well and leaves my mouth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li> My wife has a ORAL B 3000 series, and hers has a special lower speed on it for the more sensitive teeth, and that is a much better toothbrush, I want to buy one like hers, but for now until I get that money, I&#x27;ll stick to my $5 toothbrushes....</li>
            <li> Originally I would have given the toothbrush a 5 star - did a nice job cleaning my teeth, held a charge, wasn&#x27;t too loud.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I only paid 5 dollars for this item, I&#x27;m gonna say that a 3 star rating is good.</li>
            <li> This is replacing another Oral-B pulsating rechargeable brush that I loved and used for over 4 years that finally died.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and get a good one...</li>
            <li> I looked for a replacement handle for the Oral-B Professional Care that we had had for years and liked.</li>
            <li> Overall a good electric toothbrush in this price.</li>
            <li> It works fabulously and charges right on my sink.</li>
            <li> I love my new oral B!</li>
            <li> The instructions tell you to use the \\&quot;quick release tool\\&quot; to remove the brushhead.  </li>
            <li> There is a soft bristle version available, I think, but it was like $6 more or something ...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even do a better job than a normal toothbrush.     </li>
            <li> At only $12 I felt like I had nothing to lose and to give it a shot, and my teeth are very glad I did.    </li>
            <li> First time to use a electric toothbrush, have to say I really enjoy using it</li>
            <li> My older toothbrush seemed to be more powerful, but I don&#x27;t mind this one.  </li>
            <li> I love the the electrics for the kids too, because I know how long they&#x27;ve been brushing by the sound - without standing over them!</li>
            <li> First of all, I can&#x27;t believe Amazon sell toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> For the most part, I have been most pleased with my Amazon purchases over the past 12 years, but this purchase makes me feel I&#x27;ve been had.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with my new brush.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the fact that it isn&#x27;t quite as powerful could sometimes be a plus.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> weak,not worth the money</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Holds a powerful charge for about 5 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Double-action really is good for getting into small spaces (top of the brush) or just buffing and general cleaning (back of the brush)&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable in the hand and the mouth -- the brush itself isn&#x27;t too large and the grip is soft and fits my hand perfectly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size unlike</li>
            <li> The battery is great, charging station is small</li>
            <li> It is surely a good deal for less than 5.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are cheap, and it gets my teeth white, and they feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace it, as it looked to be as good, but for less money for the toothbrush and for refills.  </li>
            <li> It really packs a punch and has more action than my retired brush.</li>
            <li> The battery type are great for only a short time.  </li>
            <li> Great tooth brush, just hard to find replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Even though the toothbrush was still working fine, I eventually tossed it and got a new one once the ick factor was too much to deal with.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not in love with is the battery.</li>
            <li> But when I first started using it</li>
            <li> Since there is no timer, you have to make sure that you are brushing equally all the sides.     </li>
            <li> I had an Oral B crossaction for many years and it finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> but most of them were so big to handle.  </li>
            <li> , just be aware that there&#x27;s a trick to replacing the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of course I flossed first, but still....</li>
            <li> I use it twice everyday and it does hold a pretty good charge.</li>
            <li> Have had this for several weeks and for the price have never had a better one.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied - especially for the cost.    </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t remember exactly,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to go back to using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Just make sure the first time you charge it you don&#x27;t unplug it or take it off in the middle of the 24 hour charge.</li>
            <li> I noticed how much whiter his teeth were!</li>
            <li> A simple straight forward mechanism with good brushing action.</li>
            <li> As usual, quick shipment via Amazon, along with a reasonable price for a good product.</li>
            <li> If I time it right I can find replacement heads on sale so these have not been a real problem.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great brush for the price and highly recommended over a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> There is only one setting, but it&#x27;s adequate for effective teeth cleaning and fine for a few days away from home.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Like pretty much all rechargeable toothbrushes, this uses induction to charge the battery.  </li>
            <li> noticed the battery not holding charge as long any more.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush has a long battery life - I disconnected the charger to see how long it would go and it lasted more than a week, so it is good for short trips.</li>
            <li> When the brush is worn out, most of the time cheaper in the long run to replace the whole unit that trying to find the replacement brush.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed out the heads yet, but it looks easy enough.  </li>
            <li> Easy enough to time brushing length myself.</li>
            <li> I got it as an alternative travel brush instead of taking my 3000 smart series when I am traveling.     </li>
            <li> , I think its pure value for money.</li>
            <li> I really did not expect much from this brush as it was at a lower price range compared to smart series brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush is too big, but for my big mouth it fit just fine.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B has a special tool included whenever you, firstly, buy the brush, and secondly buy replacement heads.</li>
            <li> She wanted something gentle and this definitely does the job and feels comfortable in your mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner using this toothbrush than with my manual one.</li>
            <li> You really feel that it cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a gimmick without any real cleaning function, so I&#x27;d leave that out of the equation.  </li>
            <li> That really adds up unless you use rechargeable batteries.  </li>
            <li> They should be replaced three or four times a year (your mileage may vary), so you&#x27;ll pay as much for the brush heads in a year as you&#x27;ll pay for the unit.)  </li>
            <li> I feel like it really makes a difference in the quality of your brushing.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and if you lose it then you don&#x27;t have to pay too much for a replacement.</li>
            <li> It said in the description that \\&quot;Rubberized bristles help gently polish away</li>
            <li> However, I bought this brush for my sister because she doesn&#x27;t believe in spending that much for a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Much louder than the Vitality.  </li>
            <li> This means that the charger is using up just as much electricity as it would use to charge it whenever it&#x27;s plugged in, whether the battery needs charging, or the toothbrush is even holstered, or not.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, this one only uses a couple watts, according to my kill-a-watt and the documentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an inexpensive electric toothbrush that handles very well when I travel.  </li>
            <li> They seem to keep a charge and they are slender enough for them to hold comfortably.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s a reasonable price, and that it&#x27;s electric, not battery-operated.</li>
            <li> really works well like</li>
            <li> This experience is very discouraging.</li>
            <li> Over the past 12 years I have purchased two or three electric toothbrushes from Amazon and have been very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> It really holds charge for three months.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable feature is very  convienent.</li>
            <li> My son wants one just like mine</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break completely, but stopped having enough power to use, maybe because the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge any more.  </li>
            <li> I bought the original one from Amazon, a letter came from P &amp; G and the second one was sent from another company.    </li>
            <li> My dentist visits are significantly shorter now that I upgraded from a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The one thing is you have to apply little bit more energy with this brush than with smart series ones.</li>
            <li> He has no problems with taking it with him because the charger is small and fits into his bag nicely.</li>
            <li> The one main disadvantages with this brush is the lack of a timer.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a lot of information on their site for this particular model, and the seller didn&#x27;t specify either.</li>
            <li> It did take me, a male, a good few years before I got the hang of how to change the heads.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this brush, my first one got lost, if you looking to spend few dollars and get amazing results then  buy this brush.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for couples or families that each want their own brush but share the handle.</li>
            <li> The brush is the same as the ones with replaceable batteries, but this lets you use a fully charged brush everytime, whereas normally performance quickly tapers off after each battery change.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Great cleaning power, high revolutions per</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this toothbrush..</li>
            <li> I should say I was pleasantly surprised by this!!</li>
            <li> No complaint there--</li>
            <li> All in all though I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the price especially if you&#x27;re a college age kid or going on vacation.</li>
            <li> Only possible disadvantage is that the head is not that easy to change (you get a plastic tool when you buy replacement heads).  </li>
            <li> I normally feel comfortable with items been sold directly from Amazon, however, in this case I received an empty box.</li>
            <li> LIKE A KID WITH A NEW TOY.,IT</li>
            <li> /&gt;Had them for over a year now and still works like new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only spent $3 on this.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a real complaint exactly, it just kind of worries me.</li>
            <li> First, I haven&#x27;t found any advantage to using the Cross-Action heads, which have a second set of bristles in addition to the spinning brush.  </li>
            <li> If you are interested in trying a automatic brush and you cannot afford brushes at $100, I would definitely recommend this to you!!</li>
            <li> but this does work better than the small brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would last 2 weeks, but it definitely does last more than a week.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much he would use it, but a few days later we were having dinner and</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush after a very long time and I am surprised how much they have improved.</li>
            <li> some other power toothbrushes(i had the dual clean before and</li>
            <li> The battery charge lasts a long time even though the brush is slender and light relative to the competing electric brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall, just amazingly, astonishingly ... average.    </li>
            <li> He has been a smoker for over 10 years and is pretty self conscious about his teeth being yellow.</li>
            <li> This was the first time purchasing a Oral-B CrossAction Rechareable Power toothbush on line and was very dissapointted as I went back to using a regular tooth bush.</li>
            <li> So I went back to my regular toothbrush and got the job done in a quick second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cuz had it so long, but its been 4ever since i owned any other toothbrush...still works fine, but probably was going to break soon, a few cracks in in plastic brush cover after so many years of usage, taking it on and off.</li>
            <li> I would steer clear of this product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Need to pop the head off and clean it frequently, as the previous reviewer mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I use rechargeable batteries instead of the power stand, but haven&#x27;t had any problems with the brush at all so far.</li>
            <li> When I came across an updated version of my old one - I immediately bought it.  </li>
            <li> Cons: LOUD.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve been at college for nearly a month now and the oral b has served me well.</li>
            <li> so if your sensitive it might hurt..</li>
            <li> , however I still find that there is a limitation on how far it can go in my mouth.</li>
            <li> So far I like what I got and would recommend it</li>
            <li> but the girlfriend hates the loud whirring it creates when I start brushing at 5am.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s LOUD.  </li>
            <li> review is for the Oral-B CrossAction Power Max Whitening Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, marked Type 3733.</li>
            <li> so far my gums look a lot healthier..</li>
            <li> This electric tooth brush is just too loud to use.  </li>
            <li> The complaints in this forum are all valid: Yes, it is loud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s louder than my electric razor, not as loud as my hair clippers.</li>
            <li> I paid around 5 dollars for this brush so the pro exceeds the con by far.</li>
            <li> I use xylitol based tooth paste with baking soda in it to avoid cavities, and so far i have not noticed any detrimentatal effect of baking soda on the plastic of the brush.</li>
            <li> This makes your teeth far cleaner.</li>
            <li> The battery last long too after a full charge.</li>
            <li> In the past when I worked at the dentist, if I had staining I would just brush my teeth with the power prophy brush and it would easily remove the stain.</li>
            <li> but uh i only wish they made it silent so no disturbing peace</li>
            <li> I leave it in the base almost all the time, why place it on the counter top when it has a nice little holder right?</li>
            <li> Oral-B Cross Action Power Max Whitening!!    </li>
            <li> Went back to my normal toothbrush after about a week.</li>
            <li> but I would definitely recommend this as it cleans very well for only a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least you can view what you are actually purchasing and can check to make sure all the items are included and working correctly and get a return on your investment.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is less powerful than some competitors.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my younger sibling (13 years old at the time) but was surprised when I opened up the package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: If you buy this brush, barring major catastrophes that some others have had, you won&#x27;t go to anything else.</li>
            <li> If you have hard teeth, this brush would work fine for you...</li>
            <li> B00336EUSQ Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Toothpaste Radiant Mint Flavor, 5.8-Ounce Carton (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> so I have no other one to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> What a fantastic little cordless toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> It feels flimsy and only the very top of the toothbrush (bristles) are exchangeable (and it&#x27;s quite difficult).</li>
            <li> The Cross Action Rechargeable did not include a Power replacement brush and when I made an attempt to replace the bushhead it would not slide the brushhead off the toothbush, even when you push the QuickRelease tool on the neck as shown by the instructions.</li>
            <li> However with cross action technology I can glide over my teeth and let the brush do the work.  </li>
            <li> The cross action tooth brush I ordered June 23 was a replacement for one I had for 2 months and stopped working.  </li>
            <li> My old one was finally wearing out,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> The rechargeable Cross-Action costs a bit more, uses replacement heads that cost a little less than the single spinning brush heads, and has more power than the battery operated model, but less power than the single brush model.  </li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are also not super expensive, which is a great selling point.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several years at least, and it still works fine.  </li>
            <li> I instantly got this because I was in need of a new brush and this happened to $4.77, I was all up on that since a regular brush is about the same price.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend only used it for a couple of months and went back to his old tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It did not clean any better than a regular plain non motorized toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Yeah, replacing the toothbrush head requires a little plastic tool, but it&#x27;s really a miniminal addition.  </li>
            <li> The top half of the brush spins while the bottom half goes up and down.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong,thr brush speed seems to be slower than other braun model or whatever, briefly it is not good and doesn&#x27;t clean well!</li>
            <li> At first, I expected less because of its price.</li>
            <li> within the first month the handle near the base began to crack around the seam with the upper part of the handle, most likely due to an expanding battery/heat.    </li>
            <li> At first I felt like it didn&#x27;t move fast enough, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I would recomend it to anyone, although I feel like it brushes pretty hard</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going back to the single brush model.  </li>
            <li> Works just as well as other more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extreme sensitive teeth, but when I bought and tried this toothbrush out, it was WAY TOO ROUGH</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a little loud.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it irritates my gums when I get too close for too long.</li>
            <li> I think some of the spin action may be a bit harsh for gum lines, just something to consider    2.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts long so you can take it on the road without the charger.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long it holds its charge.  </li>
            <li> This brush head is larger than expected.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than most</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this toothbrush to people who have even a slight sensitivity to rough brushing and vibrations directly on thier teeth.</li>
            <li> The heads are fully interchangable with the other CrossActions when you do finally need to replace them.     </li>
            <li> The battery life is very long.</li>
            <li> the only complaint i have about this toothbrush is that its really really loud it makes a \\&quot;bzzzzz\\&quot; buzzing noise like a lawn mower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this model--the Cross-Action rechargeable--and the battery-powered Cross-Action, and the rechargeable Vitality with the single spinning brush head.</li>
            <li> And then there&#x27;s the Vitality rechargeable with the single brush.  </li>
            <li> I let my sister use my brush (with a new head of course) and she complained about the strength.</li>
            <li> The battery-powered model costs less initially, but has the least power (and speed) and requires a new alkaline battery about once a month.</li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;re brushing your teeth half asleep.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update, got dirty and old way to fast would not recommend it anymore.</li>
            <li> I got maybe 5 or 6 brushes total before it was almost dead.</li>
            <li> This toothbruth has delivered everything I expected -- cleans teeth well and recharges well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have a closed head.</li>
            <li> Everything was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> The brush head is so big that it is not easy to use between teeth, and it smells wired.  </li>
            <li> Beforehand, I used to brush my teeth really hard and as a result my toothbrushes wouldn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it does a neat job.     </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I do have a few, minor issues with it:    </li>
            <li> I had to recharge this device almost every other day....</li>
            <li> , I thought it is like the other models</li>
            <li> but i dont like it when other people here when i brush my teeth</li>
            <li> I thought i would purchase another for my other bathroom.</li>
            <li> Due to this brush being compact and lightweight, we also take this on camping trips.</li>
            <li> However, I have not used other brand or other series of Oral B, so I could not make a comparison.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well this toothbrush would work for someone who already has relatively white teeth, but for someone who drinks coffee and smokes...</li>
            <li> ALL THE OTHER BATTERY OPERATED TOOTHBRUSHES WERE  DONE FOR IN LESS THAN THREE MONTHS.</li>
            <li> Hurry up and buy before Oral-B realizes people aren&#x27;t buying their expensive tooth brushes and opting for this much cheaper one.  </li>
            <li> I suppose this is what they mean by \\&quot;cross action.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The brush is badly shaped and doesn&#x27;t clean well.  </li>
            <li> My mom purchased it for me to take with to college, along with a few replacement heads, so I wouldn&#x27;t worry about having to replace the cheap ones when they go bad.</li>
            <li> I found this on sale for around $10 and as it was only slightly expensive than a regular toothbrush I bought it.</li>
            <li> and It hasn&#x27;t helped with the slight staining I have from drinking tea.</li>
            <li> However, for $20 (or even less if you got it on sale like me) you can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> but i felt like i paid less and got a less quality toothbrush than what i purchased before at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with product due the fact that when item is charged then turning on application the brushhead does not rotate the powerhead, it only vibrates the brushes strongly giving the sense of massaging your gums around the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> so we have our ways of personalizing each one with names and little pictures.  </li>
            <li> Maintains a charge if not placed on charger for a few days.  </li>
            <li> We have had quite a few of the electric tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> She said it is so loud that it is uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I gave it to him a few days before Christmas.</li>
            <li> Buy replacement heads ever few months.</li>
            <li> Bought it in March, it worked well for a few months, but then it petered out.</li>
            <li> The base of the toothbrush gets hot after charging for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard to replace the heads (very tight), but other than that it does what it supposed to, and charge lasts a while.</li>
            <li> my previous Oral-B rechargeable worked without fail for over 7 years at an initial cost of $16.00.  </li>
            <li> The failure of this original toothbrush was a disappointment and not receiving a charger for the second was an additional disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Even then, the charging dock is quite small - a couple of inches across each way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally just been using the toothbrush for the past three minutes and it reminded me to come leave a review</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed especially because it is made by such a big-name manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with a wornout toothbrush and $25 bucks worth of worthless replacement brushheads.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I like about this toothbrush, is that its rechargeable, and you don&#x27;t have to waste money buy batterys!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they&#x27;re all blue</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve used other hand powered and mechanical brushes but have never experienced the level of comfort and cleaning power you get from this brush at this price point.</li>
            <li> Hard bristles.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush and its hard to find.  </li>
            <li> This means it&#x27;s hard to share this toothbrush with your spouse.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press too hard - hard enougth</li>
            <li> Yes, the bristles are WAY too hard.    </li>
            <li> I was a bit afraid to use a larger brush</li>
            <li> so bought another one just like and it shipped to me in &lt;one week to an overseas military base outside of the US.  </li>
            <li> But, the handle got icky (mold??</li>
            <li> battery failure should not have happened.</li>
            <li> I has a very small footprint, and I don&#x27;t have to keep buying batteries.</li>
            <li> Battery failed less than a year after purchase.</li>
            <li> It can be quite loud, which gets annoying.</li>
            <li> Annoying, loud, shrill buzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I was not happy with my order.</li>
            <li> This one serves the purpose well, and if it gets broken in the suitcase or lost, it was not expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just in case of getting electricuted and other disastrous issues while in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on very expensive electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Once the bristles wore down the thing was worthless.</li>
            <li> Just plain stopped working :(</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just afraid it may overheat something within the toothbrush, but then again it may just be me overreacting.    </li>
            <li> Replacing the brushhead is impossible.  </li>
            <li> But the prolem is the battery life is too bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is one bad unit or if they are all like this since I have nothing to compare it with.</li>
            <li> Go for it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed when I received the product:</li>
            <li> I have an [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] with a crack at the base of the handle</li>
            <li> so I keep it in it&#x27;s base for storage.</li>
            <li> Lasts for about a month on a charge and the base works well when it&#x27;s not plugged in and charging.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this toothbrush.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this for my wife but she didn&#x27;t like it. The brush is too big, but for my big mouth it fit just fine. Teeth feel squeaky clean. It is 5 months later and still purring along.</li>
            <li> Purchased at Wal-Mart for under $20.    Great tooth brush with replacement brushes easily available at most any store.  Maintains a charge if not placed on charger for a few days.  Replacement brushes are also not super expensive, which is a great selling point.      Overall a great brush for the price and highly recommended over a regular tooth brush.  No experience with the $40+ brushes however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about a month now &amp; I love it! My teeth feel so much cleaner using this toothbrush than with my manual one. I got a great deal on it (about $8), so I&#x27;m definitely happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li> I found this on sale for around $10 and as it was only slightly expensive than a regular toothbrush I bought it. This was my first electric toothbrush after a very long time and I am surprised how much they have improved. My room mate has one of the more expensive electric ones but I would definitely recommend this as it cleans very well for only a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has a long battery life - I disconnected the charger to see how long it would go and it lasted more than a week, so it is good for short trips. Even then, the charging dock is quite small - a couple of inches across each way so it can be easily carried around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I see is that it is louder than the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> The brush is the same as the ones with replaceable batteries, but this lets you use a fully charged brush everytime, whereas normally performance quickly tapers off after each battery change. The heads are fully interchangable with the other CrossActions when you do finally need to replace them.     Works great for an inexpensive recharable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The brush head is so big that it is not easy to use between teeth, and it smells wired.  Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally just been using the toothbrush for the past three minutes and it reminded me to come leave a review so others can know how *awesome* this toothbrush is. I honestly feel like I&#x27;ve been in for a mini-cleaning at the dentist after using this particular brush: I&#x27;ve used other hand powered and mechanical brushes but have never experienced the level of comfort and cleaning power you get from this brush at this price point. It cleans and feels like a toothbrush that could easily cost 5x as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Great cleaning power, high revolutions per second&lt;br /&gt;Double-action really is good for getting into small spaces (top of the brush) or just buffing and general cleaning (back of the brush)&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable in the hand and the mouth -- the brush itself isn&#x27;t too large and the grip is soft and fits my hand perfectly&lt;br /&gt;Price!!  I got two of these on sale and you can find great deals here on Amazon for replacing the brush heads every 3-4 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found any yet. I use rechargeable batteries instead of the power stand, but haven&#x27;t had any problems with the brush at all so far. (Will update if I ever do find something negative)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCORE: 4.5 / 5</li>
            <li> This is a great item and for this price it&#x27;s excellent. Works just as well as other more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Great one! You really feel that it cleans your teeth. Be sure to use a smaller teeth brush than your teeth for a best cleaning quality. And remember what the doctor says: Clean your teeth 3 times a day, 5 minutes each! I bought one for my parents and parents in law, also!</li>
            <li> This is not the best electric toothbrush in the market, but it does a faily good job for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years and have been happy with them.  I&#x27;ve used this model--the Cross-Action rechargeable--and the battery-powered Cross-Action, and the rechargeable Vitality with the single spinning brush head. There are differences.  First, I haven&#x27;t found any advantage to using the Cross-Action heads, which have a second set of bristles in addition to the spinning brush.  I think it&#x27;s a gimmick without any real cleaning function, so I&#x27;d leave that out of the equation.  The battery-powered model costs less initially, but has the least power (and speed) and requires a new alkaline battery about once a month. That really adds up unless you use rechargeable batteries.  The rechargeable Cross-Action costs a bit more, uses replacement heads that cost a little less than the single spinning brush heads, and has more power than the battery operated model, but less power than the single brush model.  The charge lasts several days, so I&#x27;ve taken it on business trips.  And then there&#x27;s the Vitality rechargeable with the single brush.  It&#x27;s still very reasonably priced, and has the most power, but you pay a dollar more or so for each replacement brush. (With any of these, you have to be aware that the real cost is in the brush heads, which cost $4-6 each; you get a good deal on the unit because you&#x27;re locked into buying the heads.  They should be replaced three or four times a year (your mileage may vary), so you&#x27;ll pay as much for the brush heads in a year as you&#x27;ll pay for the unit.)  I prefer having the power of the Vitality.  I also found that my Cross-Action rechargeable effectively died after about five years.  It didn&#x27;t break completely, but stopped having enough power to use, maybe because the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge any more.  No complaint there--five years for a $15 unit is fine--but I&#x27;m going back to the single brush model.  UPDATE:  I purchased a Sonicare ultrasonic rechargeable toothbrush after my dentist informed me that my gums were deteriorating despite years of using an Oral-B.  I&#x27;m so glad I did--it&#x27;s much superior.  My gums have begun to strengthen and my teeth get cleaner.  Wish I&#x27;d made the transition sooner.</li>
            <li> It is surely a good deal for less than 5. But the prolem is the battery life is too bad. I only used it for a week and almost need to charge it every day. Now I just leave the plug on the outlet.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had and I love it. I feel like it really makes a difference in the quality of your brushing. The only thing I&#x27;m not in love with is the battery. The product claims it will last up to 2 weeks on a charged battery. But when I first started using it I got maybe 5 or 6 brushes total before it was almost dead.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush thinking that if it does not work so well as a power toothbrush,i could use it as a manual one for the $ i paid.But i was pleasantly surpised.It&#x27;s just the right size unlike some other power toothbrushes(i had the dual clean before and the brush head felt too big)this also holds the toothpaste well and my teeth feel and look cleaner now.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Cross Action Power Max Whitening!!    I really did not expect much from this brush as it was at a lower price range compared to smart series brushes. I got it as an alternative travel brush instead of taking my 3000 smart series when I am traveling.     I should say I was pleasantly surprised by this!! As ever, a good product from Oral-B. This brush is very good and comparable to other costly brushes. It brushes very good and my teeth are good!! The one thing is you have to apply little bit more energy with this brush than with smart series ones. Other than that it does a neat job.     The one main disadvantages with this brush is the lack of a timer. Since there is no timer, you have to make sure that you are brushing equally all the sides.     The battery is good and it lasts more than a week when it is charged one time. I used it for 8 days without charging.     If you are interested in trying a automatic brush and you cannot afford brushes at $100, I would definitely recommend this to you!! Go for it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B crossaction for many years and it finally bit the dust.  I was looking for another one but most of them were so big to handle.  When I came across an updated version of my old one - I immediately bought it.  It was very affordable also!!!</li>
            <li> Works well - cleans the teeth and battery charge holds for more than a week. If you want to test out an automatic tooth brush this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Pros: It functions. It&#x27;s cheap.     Cons: LOUD. Hard bristles. Doesn&#x27;t even do a better job than a normal toothbrush.     I&#x27;m glad I only spent $3 on this. Went back to my normal toothbrush after about a week.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I really like this product. My mom purchased it for me to take with to college, along with a few replacement heads, so I wouldn&#x27;t worry about having to replace the cheap ones when they go bad. Anyway, I&#x27;ve been at college for nearly a month now and the oral b has served me well. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I do have a few, minor issues with it:    1. Sometimes it irritates my gums when I get too close for too long. However, this may be my own problem because I do have gums that are more sensitive than most people. I think some of the spin action may be a bit harsh for gum lines, just something to consider    2. It can be quite loud, which gets annoying. Especially if you&#x27;re brushing your teeth half asleep.    3. The base of the toothbrush gets hot after charging for a long time. This isn&#x27;t a real complaint exactly, it just kind of worries me. I leave it in the base almost all the time, why place it on the counter top when it has a nice little holder right? I&#x27;m just afraid it may overheat something within the toothbrush, but then again it may just be me overreacting.    All in all though I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the price especially if you&#x27;re a college age kid or going on vacation. It gets the job done and if you lose it then you don&#x27;t have to pay too much for a replacement.</li>
            <li> this is a pretty good tooth brush. the charging station doesn&#x27;t have a light or anything so you never know when its fully charged. but its great and so worth the money. saves me hours and hours of time</li>
            <li> This toothbrush holds a charge well beyond my expectations!  If I time it right I can find replacement heads on sale so these have not been a real problem.  The toothbrush itself has been very good, performs well, and has kept my teeth and gums in good health.  I charge mine once a month.  What a fantastic little cordless toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> I use to work at a dentist office. That being said, I was looking for something like a rubber prophy brush like what they use to clean your teeth at the dentist. It said in the description that \\&quot;Rubberized bristles help gently polish away stains\\&quot;, I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s rubber and It hasn&#x27;t helped with the slight staining I have from drinking tea. In the past when I worked at the dentist, if I had staining I would just brush my teeth with the power prophy brush and it would easily remove the stain. I wish I would of got a different rubber tipped toothbrush I saw on amazon, hope it&#x27;s still available. I wish I&#x27;d not have opened this, I already have a sonicare toothbrush, works just as good for cleaning, just doesn&#x27;t remove stains like the prophy brush does.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush and its hard to find.  They stopped selling them at my local stores.  I already owned one that died after about 5 years.  So I bought another.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush worked for about 2 seconds, and when I tried to charge the battery, (1) I could never tell if the toothbrush was charged and (2) the toothbrush never worked again any way. Quite disappointed especially because it is made by such a big-name manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Charge lasts long so you can take it on the road without the charger.  Didn&#x27;t seem especially noisy to me.  Only possible disadvantage is that the head is not that easy to change (you get a plastic tool when you buy replacement heads).  This means it&#x27;s hard to share this toothbrush with your spouse.    Less expensive than most but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Buying this Oral-B was a great deal. They&#x27;ve invested a lot of time and effort in quality. The only issue I have is trying to figure out which replacement heads to buy. There wasn&#x27;t a lot of information on their site for this particular model, and the seller didn&#x27;t specify either. So it gets 4 stars for not providing more information about the product. Overall product quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a couple of years now, and I absolutely love it. The replacement heads are cheap, and it gets my teeth white, and they feel smooth. If you&#x27;re in the market for a cheap electric toothbrush that gets the job done, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great deal so I decided to try it out. 7 months later, I&#x27;m still using it. It works great, has good battery life, and cleans well! I&#x27;m really happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love my new oral B! Not only does it work great, but it had a great price! I&#x27;ve left it off the cradle and it continued to stay charged for 7+ days - it still had charge but I only wanted to test it for 7 days.  I recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> At first, I expected less because of its price. When I got it, I was more than satisfied. Good Product!!!  I would recommend without hesitation.</li>
            <li> This performs wonderfully.  My teeth are whiter.  Delivery was fast and the price was very reasonable.  I was a bit afraid to use a larger brush but this does work better than the small brush.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with product due the fact that when item is charged then turning on application the brushhead does not rotate the powerhead, it only vibrates the brushes strongly giving the sense of massaging your gums around the teeth.  The Cross Action Rechargeable did not include a Power replacement brush and when I made an attempt to replace the bushhead it would not slide the brushhead off the toothbush, even when you push the QuickRelease tool on the neck as shown by the instructions. It may be best to purchase the product from a local pharmacy then to purchase it on line.  At least you can view what you are actually purchasing and can check to make sure all the items are included and working correctly and get a return on your investment.  This was the first time purchasing a Oral-B CrossAction Rechareable Power toothbush on line and was very dissapointted as I went back to using a regular tooth bush.</li>
            <li> Brush cleans well, very simple to use.  Great value for the price.  Liked it so well we ordered  another for my husband and he likes it too.  No reason to spend more, this brush delivers.</li>
            <li> Its such a good toothbrush I was nervous because it was so cheap but I LOVE it. I would recomend it to anyone, although I feel like it brushes pretty hard so if your sensitive it might hurt..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, got dirty and old way to fast would not recommend it anymore.</li>
            <li> The product is very good and meets expectations. I am satisfied with the purchase and recommend it to anyone interested in a quality product.</li>
            <li> First of all, I can&#x27;t believe Amazon sell toothbrushes! And I further can&#x27;t believe people would buy them online when you can get them from the supermarket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jokes aside, this brush is brilliant. Every product has its list of detractors for whatever reason, but, at the end of the day, it&#x27;s a toothbrush, it works well and holds its charge, seemingly for days on end in my experience, and the heads - you change them every time you go through a tube of toothpaste. It did take me, a male, a good few years before I got the hang of how to change the heads. The Oral-B has a special tool included whenever you, firstly, buy the brush, and secondly buy replacement heads. If you&#x27;re considering this brush, and I&#x27;m guessing you are, just be aware that there&#x27;s a trick to replacing the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first electric toothbrush I bought, at a Dentist&#x27;s recommendation that I get one, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine another brush, electric or otherwise, doing a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you buy this brush, barring major catastrophes that some others have had, you won&#x27;t go to anything else. After all, electric toothbrushes aren&#x27;t like soap, where you change brands every time you shop. Buy this toothbrush, and you won&#x27;t need to &#x27;shop around&#x27; in the future.</li>
            <li> I almost gave this four stars because I have a $100 oral b brush that is way better than this. However, I bought this brush for my sister because she doesn&#x27;t believe in spending that much for a tooth brush. However, for $20 (or even less if you got it on sale like me) you can&#x27;t complain. It&#x27;s excellent comparable to others in it&#x27;s price range so I gave it five stars. One of the best things about it is the charger. It definitely beats any battery operated brush out there. My sister used to have a spin brush pro and this is way better. Furthermore, the fact that it isn&#x27;t quite as powerful could sometimes be a plus. I let my sister use my brush (with a new head of course) and she complained about the strength. She wanted something gentle and this definitely does the job and feels comfortable in your mouth.</li>
            <li> This being my first electric toothbrush, I find it to be ok. I&#x27;m one of those nerds that reads the instructions PRIOR to using...just in case of getting electricuted and other disastrous issues while in my mouth. I think that it moves around ok, however I still find that there is a limitation on how far it can go in my mouth. I had something in the back of my wisdom tooth and after 10 minutes, the electric toothbrush still could not get it out...of course I flossed first, but still....I figured that it&#x27;ll be able to swivel it out...NOT.....So I went back to my regular toothbrush and got the job done in a quick second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I only paid 5 dollars for this item, I&#x27;m gonna say that a 3 star rating is good. But if you are going to pay more than 10 I&#x27;d think about beforehand. Also, I read that you don&#x27;t have to recharge that many times to get it to work...I had to recharge this device almost every other day....so I disagree with their instrutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and I hope this helps :.)</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this toothbrush to people who have even a slight sensitivity to rough brushing and vibrations directly on thier teeth. I don&#x27;t have extreme sensitive teeth, but when I bought and tried this toothbrush out, it was WAY TOO ROUGH and I had to stop using it after 3 trys with it. My wife has a ORAL B 3000 series, and hers has a special lower speed on it for the more sensitive teeth, and that is a much better toothbrush, I want to buy one like hers, but for now until I get that money, I&#x27;ll stick to my $5 toothbrushes.... If you have hard teeth, this brush would work fine for you...</li>
            <li> I have had this rechargeable toothbrush for over a year now, and I am a happy customer. The battery is great, charging station is small it ain&#x27;t no space hogger. So far I like what I got and would recommend it, I think its pure value for money.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT FOR MY SAME-SEX PARTNER.  HE&#x27;S SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> I really liked my Sonic brush, but can&#x27;t find it or replacement brushheads anymore.  So, I bought one of these as a replacement.  Not impressed at all. Replacing the brushhead is impossible.  The instructions tell you to use the \\&quot;quick release tool\\&quot; to remove the brushhead.  No such tool came with it, nor is this incredible trademarked tool indicated on the diagram in the instructions.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with a wornout toothbrush and $25 bucks worth of worthless replacement brushheads.  Shame on you Oral B.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I use it twice everyday and it does hold a pretty good charge. I don&#x27;t think it would last 2 weeks, but it definitely does last more than a week. Seems to do a good job and the head isn&#x27;t to large. Very Satisfied!</li>
            <li> I instantly got this because I was in need of a new brush and this happened to $4.77, I was all up on that since a regular brush is about the same price. Works great but the girlfriend hates the loud whirring it creates when I start brushing at 5am. Overall I am happy with my new brush.</li>
            <li> I have an [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] with a crack at the base of the handle but it still works. (Someone knocked it on the floor, I guess.)  I bought this to replace it, as it looked to be as good, but for less money for the toothbrush and for refills.  I see this [[ASIN:B0007DHH8I Oral-B CrossAction Power Medium Battery-Powered Toothbrush (Colors May Vary)]] is just $6.  For this, the CrossAction, I paid about  $12, one reviewer claims to have paid $3!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s LOUD.  Much louder than the Vitality.  Annoying, loud, shrill buzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like pretty much all rechargeable toothbrushes, this uses induction to charge the battery.  This means that the charger is using up just as much electricity as it would use to charge it whenever it&#x27;s plugged in, whether the battery needs charging, or the toothbrush is even holstered, or not.  Fortunately, this one only uses a couple watts, according to my kill-a-watt and the documentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is for the Oral-B CrossAction Power Max Whitening Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, marked Type 3733.</li>
            <li> Very nice second to my primary toothbrush.  I travel often and carrying my electric toothbrush with me is inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an inexpensive electric toothbrush that handles very well when I travel.  There is only one setting, but it&#x27;s adequate for effective teeth cleaning and fine for a few days away from home.  I will probably purchase another when it&#x27;s time to get another travel toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it doesn&#x27;t clean the teeth, I thought it is like the other models but I was wrong,thr brush speed seems to be slower than other braun model or whatever, briefly it is not good and doesn&#x27;t clean well!</li>
            <li> One of the best rechargeable toothbrushes on the market today for the price. This is replacing another Oral-B pulsating rechargeable brush that I loved and used for over 4 years that finally died. It really packs a punch and has more action than my retired brush. Cleans deeply and holds a charge. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> At first I felt like it didn&#x27;t move fast enough, but I was wrong.  This toothbrush works like a charm!  My teeth have only felt cleaner after going to the dentist.  I keep it on the charger all of the time so I don&#x27;t know how long it holds its charge.  I am so thrilled with this great bargain of a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Okay so i bought this toothbrush from Walmart... seemed like a reasonable price for an electric tooth brush with a free charger...    i would say this toothbrush would easily cost $25 or more but for $11? hell yeah best offer available..     this toothbrush helps me keep my teeth whiter and it removes alot of Plaque so my breath feels fresher longer..    the only complaint i have about this toothbrush is that its really really loud it makes a \\&quot;bzzzzz\\&quot; buzzing noise like a lawn mower lol  but i dont like it when other people here when i brush my teeth lol  so i only use it when everyone is away which is 3 times a week    so far my gums look a lot healthier.. but uh i only wish they made it silent so no disturbing peace heh</li>
            <li> Battery failed less than a year after purchase.Now it is just junk. I would steer clear of this product.&lt;br /&gt;This battery failure should not have happened.</li>
            <li> We have had quite a few of the electric tooth brushes.  When the brush is worn out, most of the time cheaper in the long run to replace the whole unit that trying to find the replacement brush.  The battery type are great for only a short time.  Have had this for several weeks and for the price have never had a better one.</li>
            <li> this was purchased as a replacement.  my previous Oral-B rechargeable worked without fail for over 7 years at an initial cost of $16.00.  this model was purchased at Walmart for $13.00.  within the first month the handle near the base began to crack around the seam with the upper part of the handle, most likely due to an expanding battery/heat.    In addition to this, the vibrating brush did vibrate however it would STOP vibrating once it touched anything.</li>
            <li> This was a gift that didn&#x27;t get used much but the price and shipping was great. My boyfriend only used it for a couple of months and went back to his old tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using manual tooth brushes my entire life and figured I&#x27;d make the switch to an automatic toothbrush in hopes of having healthier teeth.  Plenty of the automatic tooth brushes I found cost well over $50.  At only $12 I felt like I had nothing to lose and to give it a shot, and my teeth are very glad I did.    The top half of the brush spins while the bottom half goes up and down.  I suppose this is what they mean by \\&quot;cross action.\\&quot;  Beforehand, I used to brush my teeth really hard and as a result my toothbrushes wouldn&#x27;t last long at all.  However with cross action technology I can glide over my teeth and let the brush do the work.  Resulting in cleaner teeth and a brush that lasts longer.    Hurry up and buy before Oral-B realizes people aren&#x27;t buying their expensive tooth brushes and opting for this much cheaper one.  It makes your teeth go BLING BLING!  :D</li>
            <li> Stays charged quite awhile. Feel my teeth get a good cleaning with the dual-action brushing.  Recommend.  As usual, quick shipment via Amazon, along with a reasonable price for a good product.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 out of 5 only because we&#x27;ve only had it for a month.  I would giv eit 5 if I knew the rechargeable batteries would perform this well in the future.  We actually bought two for our kids.  They seem to keep a charge and they are slender enough for them to hold comfortably.  I haven&#x27;t changed out the heads yet, but it looks easy enough.  I am extremely satisfied - especially for the cost.    I love the the electrics for the kids too, because I know how long they&#x27;ve been brushing by the sound - without standing over them!</li>
            <li> This toothbruth has delivered everything I expected -- cleans teeth well and recharges well.  It is well worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I already own a Oral B electric toothbrush and i am very happy with the cleaning action. I thought i would purchase another for my other bathroom. I was not happy with my order. The price was really good but i felt like i paid less and got a less quality toothbrush than what i purchased before at Walmart. I paid twice the price but it has held up for over three years. This one is louder and is a economy version. The look the same online but they are not.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband who travels. He has no problems with taking it with him because the charger is small and fits into his bag nicely.</li>
            <li> For the price I do not see how this can be beat. No timer but I knew that when I bought it. Easy enough to time brushing length myself. One advantage is it cannot be over charged according to the instruction so I keep it in it&#x27;s base for storage. A simple straight forward mechanism with good brushing action.</li>
            <li> The are many pros and cons about tooth brushes.  Here are my criteria:  1) Find one you like - the more you like it the longer you brush.    This usually is a good thing.  2) If you don&#x27;t floss often - then why brush?  3) Use the lithium AA batteries. They last 3-5x longer than alakaline.    Check out this battery testing info  [...]    4) Don&#x27;t press too hard - hard enougth yes!  5) Clean your tounge and gums!  6) I travel for work so the battery verison is a must.  7) For a nice effect after brushing rinse the brush with Hydrogen Peroxide and brush with that.    I like the Oral B Crossaction I have used them for over 5 years. Remember to replace the brush head and clean that area where the head connects.    I hope you find one you like.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth what I paid for it.  My older toothbrush seemed to be more powerful, but I don&#x27;t mind this one.  It is smaller and is easier to use.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I typed oh-ral B that is a non-to-subtle way to indicate that it is better than a stick but it leaves alot to be desired.  Oh-ah-eee  it is not meant for me!</li>
            <li> This electric tooth brush is just too loud to use.  I bought it as a replacement unit for my wife.  She said it is so loud that it is uncomfortable to use.  I have to agree since when in use you can hear it all over the house.  I don&#x27;t know if it is one bad unit or if they are all like this since I have nothing to compare it with.</li>
            <li> This tootbrush works great and price was right. This is my second power tootbrush and my teeth have never being cleaner.</li>
            <li> weak,not worth the money</li>
            <li> This is a very good electric toothbrush with some unique features relative to others in the market. The battery charge lasts a long time even though the brush is slender and light relative to the competing electric brushes. The brush has a rotating action in the front part of the brush which is very good for cleaning one&#x27;s tongues. Also, the replacement brush heads are relatively inexpensive. Due to this brush being compact and lightweight, we also take this on camping trips. Recommended.</li>
            <li> own toothbrush just like this for around 8 to 10 years...can&#x27;t remember exactly, cuz had it so long, but its been 4ever since i owned any other toothbrush...still works fine, but probably was going to break soon, a few cracks in in plastic brush cover after so many years of usage, taking it on and off. noticed the battery not holding charge as long any more.  so bought another one just like and it shipped to me in &lt;one week to an overseas military base outside of the US.  would buy again, but probably wont need to.</li>
            <li> This works fabulous. My mouth feels so good after brushing with this. I&#x27;ve had several, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had. Good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It cleans your teeth better than a manual brush. I have been using this toothbrush for many months. Don&#x27;t waste your money on very expensive electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush has a good up-and-down action, to get in those, cracks and cranies, of you&#x27;r teeth.   If you don&#x27;t have, a hundred bucks, then this is a heck of a buy.And if you need tooth paste this is the best[[ASIN:B00336EUSQ Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Toothpaste Radiant Mint Flavor, 5.8-Ounce Carton (Pack of 4)]] Another thing I like about this toothbrush, is that its rechargeable, and you don&#x27;t have to waste money buy batterys!</li>
            <li> First time to use a electric toothbrush, have to say I really enjoy using it and it works!  After using it myself for one week, I also bought one for my gf.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money. It did not clean any better than a regular plain non motorized toothbrush. Spend the extra money and get a good one...you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product was just okay. I only used ita. Short time. It didn&#x27;t stand up easily in the charger and wasn&#x27;t convenient  to keep on sink. Oh we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a little loud. I like that it&#x27;s a reasonable price, and that it&#x27;s electric, not battery-operated. That way I don&#x27;t have to worry about having batteries on hand and I don&#x27;t have to think about where to recycle batteries. (Or just throw more batteries into the landfill.) The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that there are openings on the toothbrush head, allowing bacteria inside. I&#x27;d rather have a closed head. But my teeth feel super-clean after using it and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to go back to using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several years at least, and it still works fine.  Need to pop the head off and clean it frequently, as the previous reviewer mentioned.  Very comfortable to hold while brushing.</li>
            <li> Good price, and dependable. It works. It&#x27;s cheap. What more do I have to say? Perhaps there are better devices, but not for this price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for years now. It is a bit hard to replace the heads (very tight), but other than that it does what it supposed to, and charge lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my grandson.&lt;br /&gt;It really works well like Oral-B says that it works.&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B toothbrush&#x27;s are the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using oral-B for more than 1 year. I really enjoy using it. I like the strength it produces and it is easy to charge. One charge can last for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have this toothbrush and we&#x27;ve had it about 18 months.  We love it!! Yeah, replacing the toothbrush head requires a little plastic tool, but it&#x27;s really a miniminal addition.  The toothbrush is great, the charge lasts for about a week, and it&#x27;s keeping our teeth in great shape.  Don&#x27;t stop making this toothbrush!! :)</li>
            <li> It is good for me to use it. However, I have not used other brand or other series of Oral B, so I could not make a comparison.</li>
            <li> I recommend. It is wonderfull to clean teeth. It cleans more than mannual brushteeth. The battery life is very long. My husband never had gingival problems again.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because I could not find out how to order extra toothbrushes. Once the bristles wore down the thing was worthless. It does work well.</li>
            <li> I wanted an inexpensive electric toothbrush to take on trips.  This one serves the purpose well, and if it gets broken in the suitcase or lost, it was not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush works well and leaves my mouth feeling clean.  It is a bit noisy, but it is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good entry level rechargeable electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The complaints in this forum are all valid: Yes, it is loud. Yes, it is less powerful than some competitors. Yes, the bristles are WAY too hard.    Having said that, for the money, it&#x27;s fine. It works. I has a very small footprint, and I don&#x27;t have to keep buying batteries. It&#x27;s louder than my electric razor, not as loud as my hair clippers. I liked the bristle motion on the Crest Spin way better, but this one is fine. Bristles are way too hard--Oral B should know better. There is a soft bristle version available, I think, but it was like $6 more or something ... figured I would just use these for a couple months and replace the heads with softer ones when these wore out.    Overall, just amazingly, astonishingly ... average.    $.02 contributed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my younger sibling (13 years old at the time) but was surprised when I opened up the package. This brush head is larger than expected. I&#x27;m accustomed to my Sonicare where the head is quite compact. I paid around 5 dollars for this brush so the pro exceeds the con by far.</li>
            <li> The cross action tooth brush I ordered June 23 was a replacement for one I had for 2 months and stopped working.  I received the second one with a notice that the charger was being sent seperately and I have not yet received it. I have notified the company and have heard nothing from them.  Being from the Cincinnati area originally, I use a lot of Proctor and Gamble products and for the most part been happy with them.  The failure of this original toothbrush was a disappointment and not receiving a charger for the second was an additional disappointment.  I did appreciate the prompt attention I received getting a replacement now if I only had a charger-----.      I thought it worked well originally but I agree it is bulky and noisy.  It is my first electric toothbrush so I have no other one to compare it to.  I bought the original one from Amazon, a letter came from P &amp; G and the second one was sent from another company.    Janetta Morgan</li>
            <li> I normally feel comfortable with items been sold directly from Amazon, however, in this case I received an empty box. I have been trying to contact a sales representative or anyone from amazon and to no avail. Please can you send me this item that I purchased. This experience is very discouraging.</li>
            <li> I looked for a replacement handle for the Oral-B Professional Care that we had had for years and liked. I was quite disappointed when I received the product: It feels flimsy and only the very top of the toothbrush (bristles) are exchangeable (and it&#x27;s quite difficult). Not suitable for couples or families that each want their own brush but share the handle. I ended up buying a more expensive model. I&#x27;ll probably use this one for traveling and throw it out when the bristles are gone.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s not even a one-star.  Over the past 12 years I have purchased two or three electric toothbrushes from Amazon and have been very pleased with them.  But this one!  It&#x27;s inferior to the battery-operated toothbrushes one can buy at Walmart for under $5.00. The brush is badly shaped and doesn&#x27;t clean well.  In fact, I prefer using the old-fashioned nonelectric brush $1.50.  For the most part, I have been most pleased with my Amazon purchases over the past 12 years, but this purchase makes me feel I&#x27;ve been had.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years.  My old one was finally wearing out,&lt;br /&gt;and so I replaced it with this one.  I would not use anything else. This product is efficient, dependable,&lt;br /&gt;and an important tool in keeping my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to spend the money on this. It was very worth it! It works fabulously and charges right on my sink.</li>
            <li> Got it and is has been great. It has really made my teeth look and feel great. It really holds charge for three months.</li>
            <li> been a reliable brush that works well.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush, just hard to find replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush for the price. My dentist visits are significantly shorter now that I upgraded from a regular toothbrush. Lasts for about a month on a charge and the base works well when it&#x27;s not plugged in and charging. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  No batteries to change. It lasts like 2-3 weeks between charges. Just make sure the first time you charge it you don&#x27;t unplug it or take it off in the middle of the 24 hour charge. You can easily get the replacement heads at the drugstore.  Much better than the Crest Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> Awesome value...works better than more expensive toothbrushes.  Replacement heads are cheap as well.  Highly recommend this toothbrush..yes I do and so can you!</li>
            <li> We have one of these for every member of our family.  Unfortunately, they&#x27;re all blue so we have our ways of personalizing each one with names and little pictures.  I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this brush, my first one got lost, if you looking to spend few dollars and get amazing results then  buy this brush. The battery last long too after a full charge.</li>
            <li> They work great and I am still using them til now. Holds charge for 2 weeks plus and cleans good.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after seeing my wife&#x27;s toothbrush. my wife was very happy with her toothbrush and recommended it. I am very impressed with the design and having a inbuilt battery. You just charge the brush for about 10 hours and it lasts like a month or so.the charging station is tiny, so you if you lose it you are out of luck. but other than that, the brush does what its supposed to do, awesome cross movement, great quality bristles and good power. I use xylitol based tooth paste with baking soda in it to avoid cavities, and so far i have not noticed any detrimentatal effect of baking soda on the plastic of the brush. i hope the replacement heads are cheaper. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product is good for teeth cleaning and the charging feature is very nice. Overall a good electric toothbrush in this price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. He has been a smoker for over 10 years and is pretty self conscious about his teeth being yellow. I had never heard of a whitening toothbrush before so I thought I would give it a try. I gave it to him a few days before Christmas. I wasn&#x27;t sure how much he would use it, but a few days later we were having dinner and when he went to take a bite of his food I noticed how much whiter his teeth were! He said he had only used the toothbrush a couple times, but he could feel it working and I could see the results! I am not sure how well this toothbrush would work for someone who already has relatively white teeth, but for someone who drinks coffee and smokes... it works great!</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY WIFE. ALL THE OTHER BATTERY OPERATED TOOTHBRUSHES WERE  DONE FOR IN LESS THAN THREE MONTHS. I CAN&#x27;T SAY ENOUGH HOW HAPPY SHE IS WITH THIS  PRODUCT. ALL THE TIME I HEAR HER SAY I&#x27;M GOING TO BRUSH. LIKE A KID WITH A NEW TOY.,IT IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND I WOULD TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> This was so great that I got 4 more for relatives. We were all still using hand toothbrushes. This makes your teeth far cleaner. The rechargeable feature is very  convienent.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush ever. I&#x27;ve had mine for years. My son wants one just like mine but I can&#x27;t find one to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my toothbrush. My mouth feels clean after using it. It was a good buy for me. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Originally I would have given the toothbrush a 5 star - did a nice job cleaning my teeth, held a charge, wasn&#x27;t too loud.  But, the handle got icky (mold?? under the plastic edges) and couldn&#x27;t be cleaned to remove it.  Even though the toothbrush was still working fine, I eventually tossed it and got a new one once the ick factor was too much to deal with.</li>
            <li> Bought one for me and then my husband asked me to order one for him two days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had them for over a year now and still works like new. Buy replacement heads ever few months. Easy to replace but need the special tool that it comes with. Holds a powerful charge for about 5 days. Teeth feel very clean and seem whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought it in March, it worked well for a few months, but then it petered out. Just plain stopped working :( I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time does a very good job</li>
            <li> Everything was exactly as I expected. I would certanly recommend the product and the store. The price was very good</li>
