            <li>Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It is convenient because it hangs on the wall but not the quality and heat of a really top notch dryer.</li>
            <li>I love not having the hairdryer laying out in the way.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>We love these hair dryers because they are easy to use and efficient.  </li>
            <li>It was easy for me to install.</li>
            <li>Lots of power and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to install (all mounting hardware was included) and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Fine product wish I had one years ago.</li>
            <li>It is a little larger than those you find in hotel rooms, but it looks nice, has a nice feel in your hand and most importantly, dries your hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>Excellent heavy duty dryer.</li>
            <li>This is the third one that I&#x27;ve had they are great</li>
            <li>This fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>So far so good .  </li>
            <li>This was easy and quick to install.  </li>
            <li>Can easily clean out the air intake grill-work.  </li>
            <li>Love having the hair dryer ready to use but out of the way mounted to the wall.  </li>
            <li>The wattage is perfect for my hair, the 6&#x27; cord is generous so that I can move it around freely, and a handy feature is that the unit turns off soon as you replace the dryer to the base.</li>
            <li>Only wish the mounting to the wall plate was more secure.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The convenience alone is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and well worth it.</li>
            <li>Fit well near my vanity mirror.  </li>
            <li>They work okay, but they are not very durable.  </li>
            <li>I got one a year ago, liked it, bought a second one, it&#x27;s the same.</li>
            <li>Have used wall mounted hair dryers in hotel rooms for years and it finally dawned on me to stop struggling with my clumsy home dryer ... and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this model.  </li>
            <li>this was a replacement for my older Oster wall mount hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Hotter temp for High...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It takes up very little space on the wall and is very easy to install.</li>
            <li>Only suggestion would be to add a cool setting along with its high and low heat setting.</li>
            <li>This one is exactly like it, is even the same model</li>
            <li>Although, my previous ones from many years ago were somewhat smaller.</li>
            <li>Dries long hair very fast.  </li>
            <li>installation was a breeze, even mounted on my old wall</li>
            <li>Just like my old one.  </li>
            <li>The useful life as determined by the other reviews is between 0 to 3 months.</li>
            <li>Had an older one for years, it finally died</li>
            <li>This is my second one as the first one got a short in it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Although, it has only 2 temps: low and high, which is not really too hot at all.</li>
            <li>We wanted a wall-mounted dryer that would fit a narrow space and give us the power for drying male and female hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of weeks, but so far has met my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Just installed a new handicapped shower, mounted this just outside the shower above a GFI receptacle.  </li>

            <li> I also like the long cord which reaches to the end of my 5 foot shower.</li>
            <li> Most plastic latches fail after a few months, but the magnet should be bulletproof.</li>
            <li> My teen age son was leaving his previous dryer laying on the sink.  </li>
            <li> I received the item when stated and it is what I had wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> There are currently few quality hair dryers in existence; this is definitely one of them.</li>
            <li> and they failed right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Customer Service at Oster will replace the units but after reading reviews of this model on other suppliers web sites, I am asking for a refund or credit.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted over six years but unfortunately quit working</li>
            <li> My soap now stays dry and firm, and my bath mat doesn&#x27;t get waterlogged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oster should rethink this setup as it&#x27;s made to fail at this high temp setting.</li>
            <li> then I found this little wonder</li>
            <li> I would recommend only using the 1500 temperature setting for limited length of time as the fan is made of plastic &amp; if used often for long periods will cause the blade to fail as the fan shaft is made of a metal pin shaft that will cause the plastic fan hole to melt &amp; fail.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of having my hair dryer stored in a drawer, with a cord that tangled up in everything.....</li>
            <li> (My hair is thin.)</li>
            <li> and they haven&#x27;t failed me yet.  </li>

            <li> I enjoy using this product.  Dries long hair very fast.  I have no problem recommending this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I received the item when stated and it is what I had wanted and expected. It was easy for me to install. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product before.  This product works perfectly.  Great buy&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this purchase to anyone who wants a quality product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Excellent heavy duty dryer. Easy to install on wall and works perfectly and a great price.  Can&#x27;t be beat. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> My teen age son was leaving his previous dryer laying on the sink.  Sometimes the cord would be IN the sink!  This freaked me out a bit so I ordered this wall unit.  This was easy and quick to install.  I love it!  My son loves it!</li>
            <li> Fine product wish I had one years ago.</li>
            <li> Have used wall mounted hair dryers in hotel rooms for years and it finally dawned on me to stop struggling with my clumsy home dryer ... and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this model.  It is in fact the very same model I last used in a hotel room.  The wattage is perfect for my hair, the 6&#x27; cord is generous so that I can move it around freely, and a handy feature is that the unit turns off soon as you replace the dryer to the base. Reasonably priced and well worth it.</li>
            <li> We purchased two Oster wall mounted hair dryers, model 76932-710s and they failed right out of the box.  Both units made a squealing noise and were throwing sparks out of the fan.  Customer Service at Oster will replace the units but after reading reviews of this model on other suppliers web sites, I am asking for a refund or credit.  The useful life as determined by the other reviews is between 0 to 3 months.</li>
            <li> Works excellently.  Can easily clean out the air intake grill-work.  Only wish the mounting to the wall plate was more secure.</li>
            <li> As always, the Oster Wall Hair Dryer is convenient and I am satisfied. Although, my previous ones from many years ago were somewhat smaller.</li>
            <li> looks and works just like I thought it would! Out of my way, and No cord tangle is the best part!</li>
            <li> This is our third Oster Wall Hair Dryer.  We&#x27;ve used them in hotels while on business trips and thought it would be great to have one at home.      We love these hair dryers because they are easy to use and efficient.  We don&#x27;t have to reach under the bathroom sink to pull it out every morning or find a place to plug it in without bumping into anything else on the counter.  It takes up very little space on the wall and is very easy to install.</li>
            <li> Perfect for use in our motor home, hooked on the wall next to the sink, don&#x27;t have to dig for it under the sink.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of having my hair dryer stored in a drawer, with a cord that tangled up in everything.....then I found this little wonder and I&#x27;m a happy camper.  It is a little larger than those you find in hotel rooms, but it looks nice, has a nice feel in your hand and most importantly, dries your hair perfectly.  It has two speeds which are great for styling, and a cord that is NEVER in your way.  I really love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Although, it has only 2 temps: low and high, which is not really too hot at all. I would&#x27;ve preferred a Medium in there, and then&lt;br /&gt;a Hotter temp for High... but, all in all, this product is perfect for me. (My hair is thin.)</li>
            <li> It is in use every day.  There are currently few quality hair dryers in existence; this is definitely one of them.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer and so easy to install.</li>
            <li> We have bought a number of these hair dryers over the years and they hold up quite well. They have two temperature settings located under the back screen on the handle, either 1200 or 1500 temperature. I would recommend only using the 1500 temperature setting for limited length of time as the fan is made of plastic &amp; if used often for long periods will cause the blade to fail as the fan shaft is made of a metal pin shaft that will cause the plastic fan hole to melt &amp; fail. Oster should rethink this setup as it&#x27;s made to fail at this high temp setting.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  Had an older one for years, it finally died so I replaced it with this newer version.</li>
            <li> Love it.  My husband hung it on our bathroom wall.  It is not in the way and it works great.</li>
            <li> They work okay, but they are not very durable.  This is my third or fourth unit.  I get about a year out of them.</li>
            <li> This is the third one that I&#x27;ve had they are great</li>
            <li> It is convenient because it hangs on the wall but not the quality and heat of a really top notch dryer.</li>
            <li> We wanted a wall-mounted dryer that would fit a narrow space and give us the power for drying male and female hair. This was perfect, and it looks good, too. Only suggestion would be to add a cool setting along with its high and low heat setting. We would recommend this dryer for space savings, convenience, and good looks.</li>
            <li> Great for organizing the bathroom.</li>
            <li> So far so good .  Works as advertised  .  Best unit for the money I found .</li>
            <li> I now have three of these hair dryers one for each bathroom and they haven&#x27;t failed me yet.  I&#x27;m very happy with how reliable they are</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer!  Love having the hair dryer ready to use but out of the way mounted to the wall.  We have one in each bathroom!</li>
            <li> Lots of power and easy to use.  Fit well near my vanity mirror.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great, mounts nice!</li>
            <li> Gave this hair dryer to my wife for Christmas. She loves it. It was easy to install (all mounting hardware was included) and it works as advertised. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer and I love that it hangs on the wall--right where you need it.</li>
            <li> this was a replacement for my older Oster wall mount hair dryer. installation was a breeze, even mounted on my old wall bracket.&lt;br /&gt;The wife is happy!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a convenient way to have a hair dryer and keep it out of the way when not in use. This fit the bill.  Bought an extra for the guest bath.. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Was everything I was looking for, easy to install, looks great, and works great! Would recommend to anyone looking for a wall mount dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of weeks, but so far has met my expectations.  Just installed a new handicapped shower, mounted this just outside the shower above a GFI receptacle.  it does a great job both drying me off, and drying the many shelves in the shower which hold water. My soap now stays dry and firm, and my bath mat doesn&#x27;t get waterlogged.&lt;br /&gt;Best feature - The magnet which holds the dryer in the cradle. Most plastic latches fail after a few months, but the magnet should be bulletproof. I also like the long cord which reaches to the end of my 5 foot shower. If one doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;backer board&amp;#34; I recommend &amp;#34;Molly&amp;#34; anchors to mount the dryer metal bracket.</li>
            <li> I had the same Wall Dryer for several years.  Love it!  This one is exactly like it, is even the same model #!    Bette</li>
            <li> This is the second of this product that I have owned.  The first lasted over six years but unfortunately quit working so I ordered another just like it.  Works great.  I don&#x27;t have to go hunting for the hair dryer and plugging it in and putting it away every day.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used infrequently however all is working as it should with no problems. It also looks nice on our bathroom wall.</li>
            <li> This is my second one as the first one got a short in it.  I love not having the hairdryer laying out in the way.  It helps keep my bathroom organized</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I had one before and I love it.  It&#x27;s off the counter and out of the way.</li>
            <li> Works great; looks good on wall.</li>
            <li> The convenience alone is worth the price. Works well</li>
            <li> Just like my old one.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have two bathrooms. I got one a year ago, liked it, bought a second one, it&#x27;s the same. It isn&#x27;t too noisy so doesn&#x27;t wake up people.</li>
