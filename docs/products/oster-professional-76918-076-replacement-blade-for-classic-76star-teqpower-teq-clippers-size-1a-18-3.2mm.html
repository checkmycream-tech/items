            <li>I am pleased with the 1A , would recommend it .</li>
            <li>This length is perfect for fading from a standard up to a 1.5 or 2 or 3.</li>
            <li>I love the pricing.</li>
            <li>They say I need more words?</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of this product type.</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for?  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic blades that cut great and hold up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use blades all the time works great came in the mail pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Cuts my hair to the right length as I wanted!!</li>
            <li>Cuts nice, length is right.</li>
            <li>Nice quality works very well</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to these blades like I was, I find the edges of the teeth on these to be more rounded and MUCH more comfortable.</li>
            <li>They work as well as the ones that came originally with my set.</li>
            <li>Great for a 24 hour shadow look or trimming other areas of the body...</li>
            <li>I do about 20 to 30 haircut today and these blades really hold up and are super precise.</li>
            <li>Great for fades right in between the one in the one and a half</li>
            <li>What can I say, I love the quality of the Oster professional line.  </li>
            <li>Over priced and not the right blade.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using the #2 on the top and sides, now that my hair is really thin but not gone on top, we&#x27;ve switched to a 1a on top and the #2 on the side.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent for blending fades ,saves sooo much time</li>
            <li>This item is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After buying my first professional clipper (an Oster Classic 76), I was hesitant to buy many metal blades because I thought that they&#x27;d be less comfortable than the plastic adapters that I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>Very high quality...</li>
            <li>Thanks guys.</li>
            <li>Sharp, and cuts very smooth while also being very durable.</li>
            <li>brand new and ready to go</li>
            <li>the troops camo version Oster 76 classic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a complete newbie, but it seemed to work.</li>
            <li>This blade came promptly and seems to be sharpened Completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Assuming that these are as well made as the ones that I bought back in 2013, I absolutely recommend them.</li>
            <li>So far amazon has always worked for me.</li>
            <li>(Epic)</li>
            <li>Every one of them is still cutting great, although I am just cutting my own hair, so that won&#x27;t relate directly if you&#x27;re a professional and using these day after day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different than what I was used 2, as far as switching the blade.</li>
            <li>Also, if you take care of this clipper it should last you as long as you live.</li>
            <li>Size 00, and size 1 blades make you look like you live or just came out of rehab or a mental facility.</li>
            <li>i have several other blades from oster for my classic 76, and this one is no different.</li>

            <li> other reason I hesitated was the cost, as these are normally in the $20-$30 range for a single length.</li>

            <li> (Not a good look trust me).</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> what more can I say - they work as advertised</li>
            <li> works with my Oster. this is the length that i like using. better cut than using a comb attachment</li>
            <li> I use blades all the time works great came in the mail pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Cuts my hair to the right length as I wanted!!</li>
            <li> Worth every cent for blending fades ,saves sooo much time</li>
            <li> My barber (me) loves it!</li>
            <li> Works great with the 76, better then the plactic gaurds.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the 1A , would recommend it .</li>
            <li> Great product, works as its supposed to.</li>
            <li> It works. As expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing a review on the 1A clipper blade which is my second clipper blade other than the triple zero that came with my support the troops camo version Oster 76 classic.  I&#x27;m basically trying to do a fade with two blades. I&#x27;m a complete newbie, but it seemed to work. This blade came promptly and seems to be sharpened Completely.</li>
            <li> Yes, this correct. This blade size 1A is 1/8 of an inch. When you get haircuts in  a barbershop, this is the size they use when you ask for a crewcut. Size 00, and size 1 blades make you look like you live or just came out of rehab or a mental facility. (Not a good look trust me). Also, if you take care of this clipper it should last you as long as you live.</li>
            <li> This length is perfect for fading from a standard up to a 1.5 or 2 or 3. It is the missing blade for a no line clipper cut!</li>
            <li> A wonderful tool for the professional barber</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. I love the pricing. They work as well as the ones that came originally with my set.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect length for me. I shave both sides of my head into a floppy mohawkish haircut. I would recommend this length for anyone doing a crew cut or similar length haircut.</li>
            <li> Sharp, and cuts very smooth while also being very durable.</li>
            <li> Cuts nice, length is right. They say I need more words? It&#x27;s different than what I was used 2, as far as switching the blade.</li>
            <li> I bought this blade back in 2013 and have several other Oster blades going back to 2011. Every one of them is still cutting great, although I am just cutting my own hair, so that won&#x27;t relate directly if you&#x27;re a professional and using these day after day. For use at home, though, these are going to hold up. I do brush mine off after every use and oil them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buying my first professional clipper (an Oster Classic 76), I was hesitant to buy many metal blades because I thought that they&#x27;d be less comfortable than the plastic adapters that I&#x27;d been using. I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong! If you&#x27;re new to these blades like I was, I find the edges of the teeth on these to be more rounded and MUCH more comfortable. I have never once felt like I was gouging myself with these, whereas I had done that with plastic attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason I hesitated was the cost, as these are normally in the $20-$30 range for a single length. Once I spent the money, though, I&#x27;ve never regretted it. These are fantastic blades that cut great and hold up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming that these are as well made as the ones that I bought back in 2013, I absolutely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great for fades right in between the one in the one and a half</li>
            <li> i have several other blades from oster for my classic 76, and this one is no different. It&#x27;s a good quality blade.</li>
            <li> This blade did not cut thru the hair at all. Very disappointed. Do not buy from this company!!!</li>
            <li> Great Price, fit, and cut.  Very satisfied all around with the product.  Will be buying more of this product type.</li>
            <li> not very good at removing the line from my hair</li>
            <li> Great for a 24 hour shadow look or trimming other areas of the body... For crew cuts I go no smaller than a number 2.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly as described.Works perfect.Cant say I have anything to complain about.Just what I oredered.So far amazon has always worked for me.Thanks guys.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the #2 on the top and sides, now that my hair is really thin but not gone on top, we&#x27;ve switched to a 1a on top and the #2 on the side. This blade works great as does the #2, just a tighter cut now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the Oster numbering scheme:&lt;br /&gt;Oster number scheme: depth in inches.&lt;br /&gt;#00000 - 1/125\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#0000 - 1/100\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#000 - 1/50\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#0a - 3/64th\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#1 - 3/32th\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#1a - 1/8th\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#1.5 - 5/32th\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#2 - 1/4th\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#3.5 - 3/8th\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#3.75 - 1/2\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using a #00000 on the hair on the back of my neck. YMMV.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I love the quality of the Oster professional line.  The last clipper system I will ever need to buy.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d expect a company to sell what it say&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to sell. Aglon Antimicrobial Coating.... Where is it? It&#x27;s as if somebody ordered some coke, and it was weighed down with baking soda, or some other white stuff. People would get hunted for some bad business like this so long as they&#x27;re messing with other&#x27;s money. Good thing internet gangster&#x27;s are counter factual... for now. duhn DUUHN DUUUUUUUUUUHNNNNN! (Epic)</li>
            <li> Perfect blade for the length that i was searching for.  Very high quality...what more can you ask for?  I should&#x27;ve bought two.</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for. It definitely makes it easier on blending.</li>
            <li> brand new and ready to go</li>
            <li> cheaper on Amazon than from the manufacturer&#x27;s website. love these blades! I do about 20 to 30 haircut today and these blades really hold up and are super precise. thank you!</li>
            <li> Great experience, quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Did not receive the Oster blade with AgLon Coating but need to keep it to work. Over priced and not the right blade. Other barbers in my shop have had the same happen and did not receive blade advertised.</li>
            <li> Nice quality works very well</li>
