            <li>Great tool.</li>
            <li>it comes with a glove which is great</li>
            <li>I wish my 2 in curling iron worked this great.</li>
            <li>sets a great curl that holds.</li>
            <li>but when others have used it, their hair turns out great.</li>

            <li>So easy to use and makes beautiful curls/waves!</li>

            <li>You may have to touch up after you sleep on it, but even with a touch up, it&#x27;s looks good.</li>

            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love this wand!</li>
            <li>The curls held even better!</li>
            <li>The glove is a great additional bonus because of how you use this to curl your hair, however, the texture of the glove makes it easy to catch on stuff</li>
            <li>I have used the wand 3 times and each time it came out amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>just buy it amazing</li>
            <li>Every time I use this product, I always get compliments on how amazing my curls look.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic, so happy I ordered.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing..</li>
            <li>Advice watch the video on hottools.com on how to do your own hair using the iron.</li>
            <li>THIS MAKES NICE WAVES THAT LOOK</li>
            <li>The curls hold all day, gradually loosening up to a nice wave.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect and it&#x27;s very userfriendly.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants beautiful hair!</li>
            <li>Honestly this iron is JUST as good as the one I was replacing (which cost over 4x more).</li>
            <li>But i make it work, curls still come out nice.</li>
            <li>I have burned myself once w/o though - so use your own judgement.</li>
            <li>Love thus wand, curls great and the more you use it</li>
            <li>My hair is full and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Really liked the temperature dial feature.  </li>
            <li>The glove is a nice idea</li>
            <li>Absolute best one I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use this to get nice curls.  </li>
            <li>Probably works well if you have the skills for this kind of curler.</li>
            <li>so I was kind of on the fence with this clipless one.</li>
            <li>great product the curls comes out really nice and last all day a must buy and a great price!!!</li>
            <li>the ends of the hair would&#x27;ve had a nice curve.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, the best advice I could give on this product is to use the glove that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Great product, you can change the temperature which is good for any type of hair, and it comes with a heat-proof glove which is pretty handy</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed and think this is a great tool and quality made.</li>
            <li>I burned my arm, but I learned right away the curls are perfect and the trick is to be patient but overall great buy!</li>
            <li>The wand heats up quickly and does a great job with curl.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Very easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to get used to and I can style my hair faster with this wand than I could a straightener or curling iron.</li>
            <li>It was very EASY to use.</li>
            <li>and I love them, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>, my 13 year old thinks it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>Works great on my daughters thinner hair, originally bought it for me (much thicker hair) and it hasn&#x27;t gotten great results on mine.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly is so easy to use!</li>
            <li>This wand makes it so easy to curl your hair!</li>
            <li>part--it&#x27;s easy!</li>
            <li>I love love love this wand!</li>
            <li>Great iron - works well and heats up fast and makes nice curls and waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great wand, works just like the rest of my hot tools curlers.</li>
            <li>I used this taper curling iron for the first time today and my hair turned out great.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t look so great the first time, though, don&#x27;t despair-</li>
            <li>It creates a really nice waves &amp; easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Gets very hot!!</li>
            <li>and I tried them both and loved the hot tools!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my curls after using it, and the curl lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been able to hold a curl.</li>
            <li>love love love</li>
            <li>This larger size is perfect!  </li>
            <li>The ceramic is better for your hair and also holds the curl better.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought it, and wanted to let others know how well it works.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it because it doesn&#x27;t grip my hair as good, but overall great product.</li>
            <li>Was hoping to love this.  </li>
            <li>it is ok.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t grab big chunks of hair and expect it to curl, but smallish to medium bits will work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This wand is better than any curling iron.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter, it works great and the curls hold for much longer than anything else we&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I think it is better to just develop the habit of keeping a safe distance with your fingers.</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand &amp; the glove that came with it.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair when I use this tool.</li>
            <li>This tool worked like magic and it let me have the curls that I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>We both think it does a better job than a curling iron, and it seams to be easier for her also.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know what word to use, but they are more model-quality curls.  </li>
            <li>I get many compliments.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE THIS CURLING WAND.</li>
            <li>The barrel is perfect in width but the length is a bit too short, and i have shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect curling iron and this is definitely it!</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a protective spray on your hair before using this product.</li>
            <li>I love the curl this gives my hair.</li>
            <li>But best of all, the curls actually stay in place with NO hairspray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it works, so</li>

            <li>I LOVE this feature.</li>
            <li>It creates waves more so than ringlets.</li>
            <li>For example,I&#x27;ve been trying to curl my hair with the CHI straightener as many people do, but I have not been able to get it with practice.</li>
            <li>I ended up spending the extra $60 for the HAI wand instead; it works great!</li>
            <li>:) We both love it. :)</li>
            <li>I just make sure not to touch the barrel which is a lot easier to do than you would think.</li>

            <li>Love it, accurate with description and expectation.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair 2 days ago but even without freshly washed hair, it looks really nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as much now that i&#x27;ve cut a good amount of length off but still gives bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>and it works great to achieve nice looking waves on long hair.</li>
            <li>Wanted the wavy look that&#x27;s popular right now.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Without the glove you could easily burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and with the dial halfway up</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fairly easy to use, if you&#x27;re unsure you can always look up youtube tutorials.</li>
            <li>But this tool makes it easy</li>
            <li>Curly hair snarls quite easily and it&#x27;s winter here</li>
            <li>Curls so easily.</li>

            <li>RESTOn, VA Fine haired beauty.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>/wave so this product seem to work just fine for that.</li>
            <li>This iron gives really pretty curls that are perfect for the teenage set.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and I love the glove.</li>
            <li>Super cute</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t bought a curling iron for many years, so I was hesitant about buying a new one.</li>
            <li>The hot tool is very easy to use, and is quick!  </li>
            <li>I love Hot Tools products!  </li>
            <li>It takes a little while to perfect your technique using this curling wand</li>
            <li>It was really great for my daughter&#x27;s asian hair.</li>
            <li>Alright so I&#x27;ve been wanting a curling wand for the longest time, so when I saw this available on amazon</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls hair nicely.</li>
            <li>After I curl one side of my head, I run my fingers through a couple times to break up the curls and give texture, and then lightly spray with hairspray to hold the shape.</li>
            <li>available--</li>
            <li>I liked the wand, but being that my hair is so much longer</li>
            <li>the price it is for sure worth it.</li>
            <li>Looks great the next day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even slept on them &amp; woke up the next morning to them still looking great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been envious of girls walking around with fantastic curls, because frankly, mine look like crap...and uncurl after an hour.</li>
            <li>tapered wand, it works just as great, but this wand gives me the bigger curls that I wanted.</li>
            <li>Depending on the length of your hair you can really experiment with curl size since the barrel is so nicely tapered.  </li>
            <li>Depending on the length of your hair you can really experiment with curl size since the barrel is so nicely tapered.  </li>
            <li>Works great, actually easier to use without the glove.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>After searching forever for a great curling wand, I finally found one that would curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I did put a light hair spray all over to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part are the really natural-looking, beachy curls/waves I get from the tapered shape in record time that actually STAY in my hair until I wash it.  </li>
            <li>this wand gave me beautiful full big curls</li>
            <li>&amp; it gets hot very quickly!</li>
            <li>and I was in love almost right away.</li>
            <li>This full glove makes it easy to use and get the ends curled when you have layers.</li>
            <li>The size works great and because there is no clamp I can control how tight the curls are more easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is a little bit longer than my shoulders and this wand makes the most beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for something reasonably priced with great results.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use; I haven&#x27;t used the glove yet.</li>
            <li>this curling iron is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>but I love the fact that it has a hot free tip</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, heats up fast and curls stay ALL day.</li>
            <li>The curls also last and look amazing!</li>
            <li>but when you finally do, the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Makes the best curls, even with hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curls.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this curling wand to arrive.</li>
            <li>but I was so excited to use it</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about curling \\&quot;wands\\&quot; in general, i.e. the curling iron without the clip.</li>
            <li>I section off the top and bottom portions of my hair and curl the bottom first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because I need practice, especially since 120 other reviewers all claimed to have gotten perfect waves :)</li>
            <li>I was glad I had it for the first time</li>
            <li>It is my first curling iron and I love it.</li>
            <li>I was happy with how long it lasted.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find another hot glove that works as well.</li>
            <li>I find that I have far better control with this and much better results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had clean hair, I used a heat protective product.</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t have to be precise, and I don&#x27;t have to make it very hot to get the effect I want.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so soft and looks so healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li>Okay this was my VERY first hot tools curling iron purchased about 4 years ago</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a lot of experience with irons specially with curling ones before</li>
            <li>I got this wand as a birthday gift last week and WOW I learned so fast its very easy to work with, the best part is that it heats and cools off really really quuick!</li>
            <li>so you knew where the heat started and the cool area ended - otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the cool Mom now for introducing her to this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend this wand!</li>
            <li>Curls hold &amp; are full &amp; bouncy.</li>
            <li>This curling wand, unlike some others, has a cool tip.</li>
            <li>If you are going for true ringlet curls, I would not suggest this product.</li>
            <li>I love how you can really customize your curl.</li>
            <li>The cool tip makes it so it is a lot easier to use without burning myself.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand how so many reviewers are saying they burn themselves....</li>
            <li>this gave me gorgeous waves that stayed in all day and even the next day with no hairspray!</li>
            <li>favorite thing is this is can really give you any look.</li>
            <li>it provides good reach to the back of the head.</li>
            <li>This wand creates gorgeous waves that last for days!</li>
            <li>Once I practiced a little and got used to the feel of it, I loved it!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty easy to damage.</li>
            <li>once I figured it out, it was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>It was actually easy to use once I got the knack (which I had by the end of the first time using).</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and to learn how to use, which I found surprising because it usually takes me longer.</li>
            <li>This product is authentic hot tools and gets hott very fast.</li>
            <li>With the curling wand, it takes more patience in general to be able to hold your hair to the iron without getting burned (the glove is inconvinient since you can only wear it on one hand) but for a teenager or older, it is a great, reliable iron, and I am thankful that I bought it.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is the easiest style I&#x27;ve ever done with my hair and looks the best my hair has ever looked.</li>
            <li>It curls my hair so well and quickly .</li>
            <li>In the past I have owned about two curling irons and a straightener from hot tools and each time they have been the best.</li>
            <li>quickly-</li>
            <li>Product came in quickly from seller, within 5 days.</li>
            <li>: My ends did feel a bit crispy after running this iron through, however, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a much better choice compared to the traditional curling</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and my hair tends to hold the curl for a while.</li>
            <li>I had never used one before and needed one that got super hot since my hair is coarse and likes to do its own thing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats quickly.</li>
            <li>Once I got more experienced with my hair (42&amp;#34; thick hair )</li>
            <li>The swivel cord is super helpful-</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t turn in to high and burn your lovely locks off.</li>
            <li>Love it highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It works great and heats up very fast, within 1 minute it was hot enough for use.</li>
            <li>I curled my hair after sleeping on it wet all night and it looked amazing!</li>
            <li>It comes with a glove to protect you from the heat though the iron gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>The wand does get very hot</li>
            <li>Caution it is very HOT</li>
            <li>it is my new favorite toy.</li>
            <li>The curls are pretty defined even after holding sections for about 20 seconds, but after wearing my hair in a bun for a 25 minute walk to work, the curls had loosened slightly, but now 8 hours later, they&#x27;ve held great and my hair feels really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would have been nice if the designers made the cool plastic tip of this iron a different color</li>
            <li>Very adjustable and easy on your hair.</li>
            <li>I have used curing irons and have never been able to keep my curls for the whole day or get nearly as much volume as I have with his wand!</li>
            <li>I am in the process of switching to all ceramic irons and they are all Hot Tools!</li>
            <li>I can get perfect curls that last all day long!</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li>and it just depends on how hot it is set at and what product you use!</li>
            <li>I tried it out and it worked the FIRST time!  </li>
            <li>this is the best curling iron that you can find in the market.it curls in seconds and very long lasting</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair</li>
            <li>This wand works fine but the tapered barrel really makes curling hair a pain.</li>
            <li>The glove is ridiculous but you won&#x27;t use after the first go around anyway, when you get the hang of how best to do it.</li>
            <li>Maybe thats why I was able to sleep on it and curls were still fine the next day.</li>
            <li>It also works great, however I would not expect a Hot Tools curling iron not to work above decent.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, straight hair and the curls held pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been burned once or twice but it wasn&#x27;t a huge issue, and I learned quickly much like Skinner&#x27;s rat.</li>
            <li>Overall it is an amazing product and keeps curls in longer than a curling iron</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve done my whole head, I spray with light hold hairspray and finger comb after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>its fast too which is important.</li>
            <li>It does the job...doesn&#x27;t curl it as much as I would like it to, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>But, it does give a nice curl and the next morning, my curls are still rockin&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have been using a straightener for years to curl my hair but this puts much more natural looking curls &amp; waves in my hair.</li>
            <li>Which is rare for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been fun to play with.</li>
            <li>The tapered wand gives the top layer of hair a soft wavy, loopy curl.</li>
            <li>It heats up nicely, but I would recommend buying a different glove.</li>
            <li>but I rarely buy products that truly make a difference like this.</li>
            <li>The attachments are fun</li>
            <li>Luckily I rarely curl my hair</li>
            <li>1000x easier and makes more natural curls.</li>
            <li>next day, I loved the curls so much, I wanted it again.</li>
            <li>I do not use the glove, however the wand does get super hot.</li>
            <li>This iron is hot and curls quickly.</li>
            <li>The temp is super hot, but curls in 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>Get hot quickly.</li>
            <li>and I like to do my hair sometimes for a different look or more clean style.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks super smooth and shiny not dried up and frizzy!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.. no hairspray.</li>
            <li>I ALREADY OWN 3 HOT TOOLS CURLING IRONS OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND TWO WIGO STRENGTHENERS.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first wand and it creates really cute and natural looking waves in my kinky A.A. textured hair.</li>
            <li>This is the only hair tool I&#x27;ve found that will very easily make my hair wavy or curly (depending on how you use the wand).</li>
            <li>The wand was very easy to get used to and I only used the glove once.</li>
            <li>So needless to say I love love love it !</li>
            <li>Super versatile, you can do many different types of waves or curls.</li>
            <li>This gets hot super fast and the curl stays in my hair 2-3 days!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing, it takes 10 mins at most to do and can easily last a second day!</li>
            <li>Her hair is naturally curly, but she is able to do much larger curls with this, and the curls have more character</li>
            <li>well (my hair is stick straight) and the extra-long cool end is helpful in avoiding burning my fingers.</li>
            <li>It has a cool tip, so you don&#x27;t really need a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For someone like me that usually wears her hair in a ponytail, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice quality tool given the ceramic barrel, pop out stand and generously long</li>
            <li>I am still getting the hang of using it and making waves in my hair, but it has nothing to do with the iron more with me needing a little more practice.</li>
            <li>and i think this one was the right call as the curls are pretty defined</li>
            <li>so I received it super fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super fast to do hair</li>
            <li>This makes curls/waves that stay in my hair for days and heats up super fast..</li>
            <li>It was incredibly easy to use and the curls are soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick and curls fine/thin hair very well.</li>
            <li>You can use various parts of the barrel for different curls, all in all great purchase.</li>
            <li>Creates beautiful long lasting waves.</li>
            <li>I always used a regular curling iron to curl my hair and it always went flat or didnt look that great but using this wand my hair looks amazing and stays curled all day long with no touch ups or hair spray.</li>
            <li>I had heard there was a big learning curve with curling wands, but my first time using it was so easy!</li>
            <li>I did use plastic curlers and my moms old curling iron many years ago, so this is my first device and experience with modern curling tools after a bit of time of not using any.</li>
            <li>Really a great buy and would definitely consider Hot Tools for future purchases!</li>
            <li>I usually love Hot Tools brand, they make great quality products but there is something wrong with this seller.</li>
            <li>She said she like it very much.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this curling iron to anyone who wants curling their hair to be done quickly and professionally :)</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting easy and more natural looking curls.</li>
            <li>Has different heat settings and is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This particular device was recommended to me by my coworker and a friend and so far I am pretty satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>This is a really neat product for people who want to have that spiral curl look!  </li>
            <li>then section it off bottoms out first.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and we plan to return it since she got burned the first time she tried to use it.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really experimented with it much, but I love it so far.  </li>
            <li>They are great quality and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>This is my first wand and also my first ceramic curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Would buy Hot Tools again.</li>
            <li>I also have short hair and it makes really cute waves</li>
            <li>It also has this metal wire stand not to damage the surface you are putting hot curler on.</li>
            <li>This curling iron allowed me to style my hair exactly like I have been wanting it to look for years.</li>
            <li>From the first time I tried it (even though it took some getting used to with the glove and all)</li>
            <li>At the advice of a stylist friend of mine I ordered and ultimately fell in love with this curling wand.</li>
            <li>I did burn my thumb on the first go but not since.</li>
            <li>product just the Hot Tool</li>
            <li>it is faster and easier for me to use the hot curlers.  </li>
            <li>I was glad I got it though, because it gives a different and softer look, when I want it.</li>
            <li>I became a fan of Hot Tools Products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hot.</li>
            <li>this hair wand works better than a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from hair straightener as a curler, barrel curling iron, rollers, hot rollers, but nothing holds the curls in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a Hot Tools straightener that has lasted me forever</li>
            <li>I figured I would try another Hot Tools product.</li>
            <li>This curling iron gives a more similar look to what people achieve with a straightener who use it as a curling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it took me 15 min on my first</li>
            <li>I have never owned a curling wand before this is the first one I have used</li>
            <li>I like the temperature adjustment for how hot you want it</li>
            <li>created the look I was going for, on the first try.</li>
            <li>The first day my daughter used it, she curled her hair in the morning for school</li>
            <li>a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;One note: When you first slip your hair off of the wand it will look like a crimped corkscrew curl.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair so much body and volume and the waves stay all day!</li>
            <li>but this thing gets so hot</li>
            <li>It takes me about 10-15 minutes to curl my entire head of hair and, astonishingly, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend definitely!</li>
            <li>I did a lot of reseach on different cermaic wands, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li>This Hot Tool was recommended to me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really encourage you to check them out and see how they hold it to get your bearings!</li>
            <li>This works &amp; heats pretty fast!</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>a lot of time and money &amp; exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>....thought they&#x27;d be a bit bigger, but I absolutely love them...</li>
            <li>Also has a great temperature setting , I have long hair and it only took fifteen minutes to curl all of it .</li>
            <li>I thought it might take her a while to get the hang of it, but she got it with the first try.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>So after using it for the first time, here&#x27;s what helped me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used the glove the first time, but it just gets in the way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally my hair uncurls after an hour or two, but they stay for a whole day or longer with NO hairspray!</li>
            <li>- i&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a good curling iron</li>
            <li>I have stick straight hair and this transforms it to loose wavy curls that I love!</li>
            <li>I mess them up a little after letting the hair cool as I like the beachy look over perfect curls.  </li>
            <li>The temp control is a little loose and placed in an area where it gets changed as you curl, but all in all works great!</li>
            <li>Not only is this super cheap, it works wonder on my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m willing to try it some more, but honestly for the results, I&#x27;d rather use my Infiti Curl Secret, which seems to get rid of the frizz on my hair because of hot plates on my side of my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get decent and consistant curls with this iron, my hair cannot dry on its own</li>
            <li>After reading and watching hundreds of reviews for clipless curling irons/wands, I decided on this one, since I have had good experiences with Hot Tools in the past.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy hot tools products, they last me a lifetime and are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It curls quickly and the curls hold for at least two days without hairspray (much more effective than a regular curling iron).</li>
            <li>but if you have long hair i would suggest you get a longer one without rubber on top</li>
            <li>Thanks soo much!</li>
            <li>The hot glove really helps to make this product easier to use.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t usually hold a good curl, but with this, it will hold the curl for days.</li>
            <li>I would say my only true critique is that I don&#x27;t agree with the reviewer who said she was worried about using without the traditional curling iron wand with handle holder and found it super easy and intuitive to adjust.</li>
            <li>- very easy to use and the glove helps me with all other curling irons that I have.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an easy to use curling iron.</li>
            <li>I also made the mistake of trying to do too large of sections.</li>
            <li>I have natural waves but they aren&#x27;t very pretty.</li>
            <li>The wand does get very hot and I used maybe 350f so far.</li>
            <li>I like more of a loose curl</li>
            <li>Easy and fast curls that last all day!!</li>
            <li>I love hot tools and i wont buy any other brand..</li>
            <li>I have other Hot Tool products and love the temperature control on their products.</li>
            <li>Actually curls my rather fine hair unlike curlers with the clasp ever did.</li>
            <li>We have tried different styling tools and this works the best for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair!</li>
            <li>This device does not have a clip and is pretty slippery, as well as this particular conical shape that you can see in the image.</li>
            <li>This curling wand not only heats up quickly but also allows you to control the temperature so if you have thick hair, it works great.  </li>
            <li>The Heat glove works nicely and is a little scratchy, but helps a bit.</li>
            <li>I have not used the glove yet and to be honest did burn myself just a little once, but that&#x27;s not the end of the world.</li>
            <li>Really a great buy and would definitely consider Hot Tools for future purchases!brush the curls out with a flat brush.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest looking into the gold plated ones by hot tools</li>
            <li>This item arrived fast and as advertised.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t burn myself.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had a ceramic iron that cost $150, not wanting to spend that much I went with this tine</li>
            <li>I always used curling irons with clips before, but I heard so much about these clipless ones that I had to try it out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>works like an absolute charm.</li>
            <li>If it broke on me, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be as much of a loss, and I wanted to give the brand a try.</li>
            <li>The hair always wants to slip to the thinner end.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would make that much of a change</li>
            <li>but it really does.</li>
            <li>The ceramic coating protects your hair from too much damage.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but my hair holds very well when I use this rod.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t really need to don the glove.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t really need to.</li>
            <li>They are really helpful.</li>
            <li>This really prevents burning.</li>
            <li>It does very well.  </li>
            <li>Lightly spray the curls when you&#x27;re done, and 15 min later run your fingers through to loosen them.  </li>
            <li>My hair wants to stay straight</li>
            <li>It is very inexpensive for the end result.</li>
            <li>but I have not used it much because my hair seems to slip away from it</li>
            <li>Lightweight, swivel cord, heats up incredibly fast - literally</li>
            <li>Shipped so fast</li>
            <li>Works fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the glove at all, I found it to be much easier without it</li>
            <li>I couldnt get the hang of the glove really</li>
            <li>You also really need to use the glove so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t fool with my hair all that much...</li>
            <li>Much easier than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>but i read reviews here and thanks for them</li>
            <li>gently tousled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get used to using this wand versus a regular curling iron but the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>This curling iron works better than any other I have tried on my straight hair.</li>
            <li>another tip that might&#x27;ve helped hold the curl the 2nd time: When you&#x27;ve got the curl on the barrel, 20 secs was good like the other person reviewed.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a MUCH better price than any other website or supply store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how people use it without it, maybe it takes more practice!</li>
            <li>and I like it better than any other brand.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and I can do loose waves in my hair easily.</li>
            <li>You can make them even more relaxed/beachy by pulling straight down on each section after curling it.</li>
            <li>I have soft long, fine hair that refused to hold a curl until I tried the Hot Tools wand.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and was able to make long, bouncy curls on the first attempt!</li>
            <li>Great for my hard to curl Asian hair!</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate, year around.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine and even if I curl it with hot rollers, by the end of the day my hair just has a slight wave.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and the curls actually stay.</li>
            <li>so you have a place to rest a finger and keep it steady.</li>
            <li>did a lot of research on different brands, and decided this hot tools wand looked pretty comparable.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, and the curls hold until the next day for me.</li>
            <li>It quickly went back.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice that it comes with it, but if you are careful while using the iron, the glove isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and the curls last!  </li>
            <li>the iron gets VERY hot, so definitely use the glove).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wand.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I never had good second day hair (looked greasy and flat even with dry shampoo and curling again), but now I actually think my hair looks better the second day.</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough, is easy to use and the curl stays all day long.  </li>
            <li>Very easy and as a mother of two small children...</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m in a hurry I don&#x27;t bother sectioning, but sectioning does give a little more volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Hot Tools iron is sleek and light-weight; It heats fast and works well, but I would not recommend this particular iron to someone who was looking to curl their entire head (and doing it them self!).</li>
            <li>It was a little different to get use to compared to a regular iron, but the curls turn out great.  </li>
            <li>Works fast and so far haven&#x27;t burnt my hand.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how fast I could curl my hair with this curler.</li>
            <li>Mind you, I have only used it once, just to play around with it real fast.</li>
            <li>Also the curl stays in my hair all day without hair spray and that&#x27;s a lot to say for my hair because before I could never get curls to hold normally by the time I got all the way done it was already falling out .</li>
            <li>There is no clip to hold hair against the curling iron like a normal one.</li>
            <li>Regular curling irons would always damage my hair too, so pretty much stopped using them.</li>
            <li>As my hair is so long, I prefer to not have 5 full curls in each strand before the end of my hair</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, stays hot, and the curl actually holds without any spray needed!</li>
            <li>I watched a few youtube videos on how to use this type of curling iron and was glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the largest size (1 1/4), and my hair is baaarely able to just wrap around it (however I am planning on getting a hair cut to get a few inches off).</li>
            <li>I set it to 330 degrees, use heat spray, roll the hair, set for about 8 seconds, then hold the curl for a few more seconds (w/o the iron).</li>
            <li>If you want thin spiral curls, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>I live in South Texas and the humidity is is really high and</li>
            <li>I finally found a product that is easy to use for my long straight hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an easy hair tool to use and the curls last all day!</li>
            <li>The key is to let the curl set in your hand right after you release it.</li>
            <li>Use the glove and switch hands from left to right</li>
            <li>One of the first times I used it, I looked like I kept the first 4 incles of my hair straight, curled the next 7, and left the bottom 2 inces</li>
            <li>You need to hold it a certain angle (Skinnier end facing down, not up) on each side to get the right curl, and just like any beauty technique takes some practice!</li>
            <li>Lastly, do not forget to put some kind of product in your hair (research separately, as I am doing it now) as it all depends on your hair, not this curler, how long the curls will last.</li>
            <li>I WAS NOT GOING TO BUY ONE OF THESE NEW TAPERED CURLING IRONS.  </li>
            <li>I have straight, coarse hair that does not hold curl very well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this wand after researching similar products around and have to say, it&#x27;s put that smooth curl back in my hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried using it without blow drying my hair smooth (my natural hair is a fairly tight curl) and it really smoothed the frizz out.</li>
            <li>She was also able to cut down her &amp;#34;curling time&amp;#34; from 1 hour to 20 minutes too!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve typically just blow-dried smooth and put hot rollers, but my hair has gotten so long that they no longer stay in or give much of a curl anyway.</li>
            <li>story short:  Curls hold very well, even for fine/thin hair!</li>
            <li>I recently got curlers and after several weeks, finally the curls started looking better as I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>The curl lasts several days and this is a much better price than other irons I have seen out there.</li>
            <li>Not sure why everyone seems to love this iron.</li>
            <li>so I was very pleasantly surprised when it lasted all day, then some!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>and it looked exactly the same by the end of the school day!!</li>
            <li>And, it gets hot enough to keep my hair curly all day.</li>
            <li>me literally ten mins to do my whole head, if you&#x27;re thinking about getting it, don&#x27;t think!</li>
            <li>I received it and it took me like 15 minutes to get used to it other than that it is the only curling wand/iron that helps my hair stay curly for two days :)</li>
            <li>I did put on the glove after burning my hand a little, but it&#x27;s easy to hold with the glove on.</li>
            <li>but the little stand to support it broke off rather easily..</li>
            <li>and its so light not a problem to hold upside down</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of product in my hair and these curls stay pretty tight even when I only use some light hair mousse.</li>
            <li>Bought this iron, and though the heat glove was MIA, it was fairly easy to use (I watched a few Youtube tutorials before ordering the iron).</li>
            <li>It is very different from regular curling (iron) devices and it takes learning to do it as it has no clip, but the end result is really cool.</li>
            <li>My first thought about it was that it was super weird to use, since I&#x27;ve been only curling my hair with a straightener, but after some time of getting the hang of it I really enjoy it!</li>
            <li>I wish the barrel was a little thicker, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>Be sure to hold the hair around the iron for several seconds to get a long lasting curl that holds.</li>
            <li>I did order the larger one because my hair is long, and I like the big curl look more.</li>
            <li>When I bought it, I was really hoping to find an iron that gave me large loose curls.  </li>
            <li>I also love the black and white look.</li>
            <li>It has different heat settings and it definitely heats up quick.</li>
            <li>Wish they made a large size for bigger curls.</li>
            <li>I have major issues curling my hair with a normal curling iron</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I changed my mind and paid a little extra for this one.</li>
            <li>NATURAL</li>
            <li>So far I like it a lot, and would recommend it to anyone contimplating on buying this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This wand makes my hair really shiny and the curls stay well into the next day.</li>
            <li>TONS of compliments and the husband said WOW.</li>
            <li>Now, I have used the wand multiple times and its much easier.</li>
            <li>I use Hot Tools Marcel Irons often for work, but this iron is not professional grade.</li>
            <li>Took a few days to feel comfortable holding it</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my 14yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been doing hair professionally for over 20 yrs.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m coming around and as far as the tool goes</li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable if you are getting it for personal use.</li>
            <li>I did a YouTube review and how to use tutorial if you want to see it in action.</li>
            <li>so we switched to the old fashioned curler.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how the curls stayed.  </li>
            <li>and I find using this spray makes brushing out your hair later much, much easier.</li>
            <li>I recently received this wand and after using it a few times I can say that I love it.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that refused to hold a curl for more than an hour but after 4 hours it looks like I just finished curling.</li>
            <li>My hair hits right below my boobs, and it is hard to wrap my longer pieces to fit in entire barrel</li>
            <li>I have very long hair, it down to my bum, and was worried this might not be able to handle all my hair..</li>
            <li>it was well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>I have hair all the way down my back, and I am able to curl my entire head in 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything from sponge rollers to hot rollers to traditional curling irons of various barrel sizes.</li>
            <li>I returned this item because it does not get hot enough and the barrel is too short.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would suggest is getting a hot tools wand that is the same thickness throughout, hair tends to slide up on the contoured ones like these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought another similar item but the glove only covered the thumb and first two fingers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the glove it came with (too scratchy and bulky) and take my chances with using my bare hands with the iron- so far no injuries (knock on wood).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works just as fast as a hair straightener and you wont need a ton of hairspray to hold the curls for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that typically is very time consuming to style.</li>
            <li>I used the glove the first time but find I didn&#x27;t need it if I was careful after that.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>my hair is really thin, fine, and straight</li>
            <li>I would also highly recommend using the included glove the first few times around.</li>
            <li>I would also highly recommend using the included glove the first few times around.</li>
            <li>At first it was pretty confusing to use it, but you can watch a bunch of youtube videos or just invent your way to do</li>
            <li>I got the biggest barrel (1.25&amp;#34;) because I have long hair and like the way bigger, softer curls look.</li>
            <li>use clips and clip up the part that is already wavy (never to the top of my scalp or the waves look weird) and the clips really help.</li>
            <li>I was deciding between this product and the Remington brand, but with the Remington brand, I didn&#x27;t like how the thin one was too thin, and the fat one was too fat, so I figured this was the perfect in between product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other Hot Tools curling irons</li>
            <li>We have other Hot Tools that we use and like the brand.  </li>
            <li>Normally when she uses a curling iron, her hair is flat by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to from the traditional curling iron, but SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>The only small downside is that the glove rips fairly easily, but that could just be my fault.</li>
            <li>Wife loves this thing, her curls last all day long (as long as it is dry outside, got 2 more it worked so well.</li>
            <li>Very hard at first figuring out how to wrap hair around the iron doing it on yourself, but once you get the hang of it, it works so much better than your typical curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Fast and long lasting curl.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it last for long as you never know with technologies.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still not so fast with them</li>
            <li>but it took barely anytime.</li>
            <li>So far, my daughter is the only one that has used this.</li>
            <li>I can barely feel the heat through the glove (don&#x27;t be fooled-</li>
            <li>It is time consuming, and, I still use my regular curling iron for the underneath layer of hair (especially in the back where you cannot see) to get all they straight ends smoothed out and/or turned under.</li>
            <li>I bet it would damage thinner hair if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as big and round but still looked cool, like</li>
            <li>Cools down fast, too!</li>
            <li>It does have a little bit of a learning curve and takes a few tries to get right, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>I recommend letting your hair dry naturally, or with a blowdryer for a bit and let it finish drying naturally.</li>
            <li>By the time I finished my whole head, the curls had relaxed into big defined loose curls.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, I&#x27;m not great with hair but can do this!</li>
            <li>At first it was a little tricky to use</li>
            <li>I point the tapered end down and wrap large pieces of hair around the iron.</li>
            <li>It can make loose waves if you start with your hair high on the barrel and hold for only a couple seconds, then brush out.</li>
            <li>My go-to is to blow dry straight, do the tight ringlets, add a bit of Moroccan hair oil, and then gently brush the curls out with a flat brush.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted me for a few years, and I used it a lot.</li>
            <li>personally really like that it is made from nano ceramics which suppose to damage your hair less, also it has regulated heat for your type of hair (can be used around the house for all types of hair).</li>
            <li>I bought the large curling wand because I had had a friend use a smaller one on my hair in the past and the curls were much too tight and made my hair appear even more thin.  </li>
            <li>You can do large sections for big waves or little sections for tighter curls.</li>
            <li>I have really straight hair that typically needs tons of hair spray and will only hold a curl for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>and I have to pull it strait with my large round brush while blowdrying.  </li>
            <li>This particular product cuts your blow drying time down and it helps detangle your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, fairly thin hair that generally curls fairly easily</li>
            <li>The middle of my strand of hair would look great, and then torwards the end it just got all weird and wonky looking.  </li>

            <li> Honestly this iron is JUST as good as the one I was replacing (which cost over 4x more).</li>
            <li> But i make it work, curls still come out nice.</li>
            <li> I have burned myself once w/o though - so use your own judgement.</li>
            <li> Love thus wand, curls great and the more you use it</li>
            <li> My hair is full and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Really liked the temperature dial feature.  </li>
            <li> The glove is a nice idea</li>
            <li> Absolute best one I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use this to get nice curls.  </li>
            <li> Probably works well if you have the skills for this kind of curler.</li>
            <li> so I was kind of on the fence with this clipless one.</li>
            <li> great product the curls comes out really nice and last all day a must buy and a great price!!!</li>
            <li> the ends of the hair would&#x27;ve had a nice curve.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, the best advice I could give on this product is to use the glove that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Great product, you can change the temperature which is good for any type of hair, and it comes with a heat-proof glove which is pretty handy</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed and think this is a great tool and quality made.</li>
            <li> I burned my arm, but I learned right away the curls are perfect and the trick is to be patient but overall great buy!</li>
            <li> The wand heats up quickly and does a great job with curl.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to get used to and I can style my hair faster with this wand than I could a straightener or curling iron.</li>
            <li> It was very EASY to use.</li>
            <li> and I love them, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> , my 13 year old thinks it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughters thinner hair, originally bought it for me (much thicker hair) and it hasn&#x27;t gotten great results on mine.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> This wand makes it so easy to curl your hair!</li>
            <li> part--it&#x27;s easy!</li>
            <li> I love love love this wand!</li>
            <li> Great iron - works well and heats up fast and makes nice curls and waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great wand, works just like the rest of my hot tools curlers.</li>
            <li> I used this taper curling iron for the first time today and my hair turned out great.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t look so great the first time, though, don&#x27;t despair-</li>
            <li> It creates a really nice waves &amp; easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Gets very hot!!</li>
            <li> and I tried them both and loved the hot tools!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my curls after using it, and the curl lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been able to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> love love love</li>
            <li> This larger size is perfect!  </li>
            <li> The ceramic is better for your hair and also holds the curl better.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought it, and wanted to let others know how well it works.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it because it doesn&#x27;t grip my hair as good, but overall great product.</li>
            <li> Was hoping to love this.  </li>
            <li> it is ok.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t grab big chunks of hair and expect it to curl, but smallish to medium bits will work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This wand is better than any curling iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, it works great and the curls hold for much longer than anything else we&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I think it is better to just develop the habit of keeping a safe distance with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand &amp; the glove that came with it.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair when I use this tool.</li>
            <li> This tool worked like magic and it let me have the curls that I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> We both think it does a better job than a curling iron, and it seams to be easier for her also.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know what word to use, but they are more model-quality curls.  </li>
            <li> I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE THIS CURLING WAND.</li>
            <li> The barrel is perfect in width but the length is a bit too short, and i have shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect curling iron and this is definitely it!</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a protective spray on your hair before using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the curl this gives my hair.</li>
            <li> But best of all, the curls actually stay in place with NO hairspray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it works, so</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this feature.</li>
            <li> It creates waves more so than ringlets.</li>
            <li> For example,I&#x27;ve been trying to curl my hair with the CHI straightener as many people do, but I have not been able to get it with practice.</li>
            <li> I ended up spending the extra $60 for the HAI wand instead; it works great!</li>
            <li> :) We both love it. :)</li>
            <li> I just make sure not to touch the barrel which is a lot easier to do than you would think.</li>
            <li> Love this tool, getting tons of compliments on my curls.</li>
            <li> Love that the controls are out of the way</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this curler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I thought I would love it after my cousin recommending it to me.</li>
            <li> I have burned many fingers (I don&#x27;t use the glove)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with it and love the results.</li>
            <li> I love that this wand it has temperature control so you can choose the heat setting you want.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li> After using this iron, my hair lasted through 20mph winds and a light drizzle!</li>
            <li> and it still works on my hair :)</li>
            <li> What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> I am so glad i bought this</li>
            <li> and I totally love it.</li>
            <li> but when you do you&#x27;ll love the outcome.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you are curling AWAY from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> works great and heats fast.</li>

            <li> Overall, very good purchase, impressed at how easy it is to use and that you don&#x27;t need to hold your hair in very long to have the curls stay in.</li>
            <li> Love it, accurate with description and expectation.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair 2 days ago but even without freshly washed hair, it looks really nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as much now that i&#x27;ve cut a good amount of length off but still gives bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> and it works great to achieve nice looking waves on long hair.</li>
            <li> Wanted the wavy look that&#x27;s popular right now.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Without the glove you could easily burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and with the dial halfway up</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fairly easy to use, if you&#x27;re unsure you can always look up youtube tutorials.</li>
            <li> But this tool makes it easy</li>
            <li> Curly hair snarls quite easily and it&#x27;s winter here</li>
            <li> Curls so easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>

            <li> It is easy on her fine hair and holds the curl</li>
            <li> it works amazingly and heats up really fast!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the wand, it took me quite some time to curl my own hair.</li>
            <li> it definitely gives it beautiful curls without burning your hair or making it fizzy or too curly.</li>
            <li> pro of this iron, it does do a natural looking nice curls and doesn&#x27;t look like it damages the hair!</li>

            <li> RESTOn, VA Fine haired beauty.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> /wave so this product seem to work just fine for that.</li>
            <li> This iron gives really pretty curls that are perfect for the teenage set.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and I love the glove.</li>
            <li> Super cute</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t bought a curling iron for many years, so I was hesitant about buying a new one.</li>
            <li> The hot tool is very easy to use, and is quick!  </li>
            <li> I love Hot Tools products!  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to perfect your technique using this curling wand</li>
            <li> It was really great for my daughter&#x27;s asian hair.</li>
            <li> Alright so I&#x27;ve been wanting a curling wand for the longest time, so when I saw this available on amazon</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls hair nicely.</li>
            <li> After I curl one side of my head, I run my fingers through a couple times to break up the curls and give texture, and then lightly spray with hairspray to hold the shape.</li>
            <li> available--</li>
            <li> I liked the wand, but being that my hair is so much longer</li>
            <li> the price it is for sure worth it.</li>
            <li> Looks great the next day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even slept on them &amp; woke up the next morning to them still looking great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been envious of girls walking around with fantastic curls, because frankly, mine look like crap...and uncurl after an hour.</li>
            <li> tapered wand, it works just as great, but this wand gives me the bigger curls that I wanted.</li>
            <li> Depending on the length of your hair you can really experiment with curl size since the barrel is so nicely tapered.  </li>
            <li> Depending on the length of your hair you can really experiment with curl size since the barrel is so nicely tapered.  </li>
            <li> Works great, actually easier to use without the glove.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li> After searching forever for a great curling wand, I finally found one that would curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I did put a light hair spray all over to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best part are the really natural-looking, beachy curls/waves I get from the tapered shape in record time that actually STAY in my hair until I wash it.  </li>
            <li> this wand gave me beautiful full big curls</li>
            <li> &amp; it gets hot very quickly!</li>
            <li> and I was in love almost right away.</li>
            <li> This full glove makes it easy to use and get the ends curled when you have layers.</li>
            <li> The size works great and because there is no clamp I can control how tight the curls are more easily.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little bit longer than my shoulders and this wand makes the most beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for something reasonably priced with great results.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use; I haven&#x27;t used the glove yet.</li>
            <li> this curling iron is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> but I love the fact that it has a hot free tip</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, heats up fast and curls stay ALL day.</li>
            <li> The curls also last and look amazing!</li>
            <li> but when you finally do, the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Makes the best curls, even with hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curls.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this curling wand to arrive.</li>
            <li> but I was so excited to use it</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about curling \\&quot;wands\\&quot; in general, i.e. the curling iron without the clip.</li>
            <li> I section off the top and bottom portions of my hair and curl the bottom first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because I need practice, especially since 120 other reviewers all claimed to have gotten perfect waves :)</li>
            <li> I was glad I had it for the first time</li>
            <li> It is my first curling iron and I love it.</li>
            <li> I was happy with how long it lasted.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find another hot glove that works as well.</li>
            <li> I find that I have far better control with this and much better results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had clean hair, I used a heat protective product.</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t have to be precise, and I don&#x27;t have to make it very hot to get the effect I want.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so soft and looks so healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li> Okay this was my VERY first hot tools curling iron purchased about 4 years ago</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a lot of experience with irons specially with curling ones before</li>
            <li> I got this wand as a birthday gift last week and WOW I learned so fast its very easy to work with, the best part is that it heats and cools off really really quuick!</li>
            <li> so you knew where the heat started and the cool area ended - otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the cool Mom now for introducing her to this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend this wand!</li>
            <li> Curls hold &amp; are full &amp; bouncy.</li>
            <li> This curling wand, unlike some others, has a cool tip.</li>
            <li> If you are going for true ringlet curls, I would not suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I love how you can really customize your curl.</li>
            <li> The cool tip makes it so it is a lot easier to use without burning myself.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand how so many reviewers are saying they burn themselves....</li>
            <li> this gave me gorgeous waves that stayed in all day and even the next day with no hairspray!</li>
            <li> favorite thing is this is can really give you any look.</li>
            <li> it provides good reach to the back of the head.</li>
            <li> This wand creates gorgeous waves that last for days!</li>
            <li> Once I practiced a little and got used to the feel of it, I loved it!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty easy to damage.</li>
            <li> once I figured it out, it was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> It was actually easy to use once I got the knack (which I had by the end of the first time using).</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and to learn how to use, which I found surprising because it usually takes me longer.</li>
            <li> This product is authentic hot tools and gets hott very fast.</li>
            <li> With the curling wand, it takes more patience in general to be able to hold your hair to the iron without getting burned (the glove is inconvinient since you can only wear it on one hand) but for a teenager or older, it is a great, reliable iron, and I am thankful that I bought it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the easiest style I&#x27;ve ever done with my hair and looks the best my hair has ever looked.</li>
            <li> It curls my hair so well and quickly .</li>
            <li> In the past I have owned about two curling irons and a straightener from hot tools and each time they have been the best.</li>
            <li> quickly-</li>
            <li> Product came in quickly from seller, within 5 days.</li>
            <li> : My ends did feel a bit crispy after running this iron through, however, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a much better choice compared to the traditional curling</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and my hair tends to hold the curl for a while.</li>
            <li> I had never used one before and needed one that got super hot since my hair is coarse and likes to do its own thing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats quickly.</li>
            <li> Once I got more experienced with my hair (42&amp;#34; thick hair )</li>
            <li> The swivel cord is super helpful-</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t turn in to high and burn your lovely locks off.</li>
            <li> Love it highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It works great and heats up very fast, within 1 minute it was hot enough for use.</li>
            <li> I curled my hair after sleeping on it wet all night and it looked amazing!</li>
            <li> It comes with a glove to protect you from the heat though the iron gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> The wand does get very hot</li>
            <li> Caution it is very HOT</li>
            <li> it is my new favorite toy.</li>
            <li> The curls are pretty defined even after holding sections for about 20 seconds, but after wearing my hair in a bun for a 25 minute walk to work, the curls had loosened slightly, but now 8 hours later, they&#x27;ve held great and my hair feels really good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would have been nice if the designers made the cool plastic tip of this iron a different color</li>
            <li> Very adjustable and easy on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used curing irons and have never been able to keep my curls for the whole day or get nearly as much volume as I have with his wand!</li>
            <li> I am in the process of switching to all ceramic irons and they are all Hot Tools!</li>
            <li> I can get perfect curls that last all day long!</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li> and it just depends on how hot it is set at and what product you use!</li>
            <li> I tried it out and it worked the FIRST time!  </li>
            <li> this is the best curling iron that you can find in the market.it curls in seconds and very long lasting</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair</li>
            <li> This wand works fine but the tapered barrel really makes curling hair a pain.</li>
            <li> The glove is ridiculous but you won&#x27;t use after the first go around anyway, when you get the hang of how best to do it.</li>
            <li> Maybe thats why I was able to sleep on it and curls were still fine the next day.</li>
            <li> It also works great, however I would not expect a Hot Tools curling iron not to work above decent.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, straight hair and the curls held pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burned once or twice but it wasn&#x27;t a huge issue, and I learned quickly much like Skinner&#x27;s rat.</li>
            <li> Overall it is an amazing product and keeps curls in longer than a curling iron</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve done my whole head, I spray with light hold hairspray and finger comb after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> its fast too which is important.</li>
            <li> It does the job...doesn&#x27;t curl it as much as I would like it to, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> worth the price</li>
            <li> But, it does give a nice curl and the next morning, my curls are still rockin&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using a straightener for years to curl my hair but this puts much more natural looking curls &amp; waves in my hair.</li>
            <li> Which is rare for my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been fun to play with.</li>
            <li> The tapered wand gives the top layer of hair a soft wavy, loopy curl.</li>
            <li> It heats up nicely, but I would recommend buying a different glove.</li>
            <li> but I rarely buy products that truly make a difference like this.</li>
            <li> The attachments are fun</li>
            <li> Luckily I rarely curl my hair</li>
            <li> 1000x easier and makes more natural curls.</li>
            <li> next day, I loved the curls so much, I wanted it again.</li>
            <li> I do not use the glove, however the wand does get super hot.</li>
            <li> This iron is hot and curls quickly.</li>
            <li> The temp is super hot, but curls in 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> Get hot quickly.</li>
            <li> and I like to do my hair sometimes for a different look or more clean style.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks super smooth and shiny not dried up and frizzy!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.. no hairspray.</li>
            <li> I ALREADY OWN 3 HOT TOOLS CURLING IRONS OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND TWO WIGO STRENGTHENERS.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first wand and it creates really cute and natural looking waves in my kinky A.A. textured hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair tool I&#x27;ve found that will very easily make my hair wavy or curly (depending on how you use the wand).</li>
            <li> The wand was very easy to get used to and I only used the glove once.</li>
            <li> So needless to say I love love love it !</li>
            <li> Super versatile, you can do many different types of waves or curls.</li>
            <li> This gets hot super fast and the curl stays in my hair 2-3 days!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing, it takes 10 mins at most to do and can easily last a second day!</li>
            <li> Her hair is naturally curly, but she is able to do much larger curls with this, and the curls have more character</li>
            <li> well (my hair is stick straight) and the extra-long cool end is helpful in avoiding burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> It has a cool tip, so you don&#x27;t really need a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For someone like me that usually wears her hair in a ponytail, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice quality tool given the ceramic barrel, pop out stand and generously long</li>
            <li> I am still getting the hang of using it and making waves in my hair, but it has nothing to do with the iron more with me needing a little more practice.</li>
            <li> and i think this one was the right call as the curls are pretty defined</li>
            <li> so I received it super fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super fast to do hair</li>
            <li> This makes curls/waves that stay in my hair for days and heats up super fast..</li>
            <li> It was incredibly easy to use and the curls are soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick and curls fine/thin hair very well.</li>
            <li> You can use various parts of the barrel for different curls, all in all great purchase.</li>
            <li> Creates beautiful long lasting waves.</li>
            <li> I always used a regular curling iron to curl my hair and it always went flat or didnt look that great but using this wand my hair looks amazing and stays curled all day long with no touch ups or hair spray.</li>
            <li> I had heard there was a big learning curve with curling wands, but my first time using it was so easy!</li>
            <li> I did use plastic curlers and my moms old curling iron many years ago, so this is my first device and experience with modern curling tools after a bit of time of not using any.</li>
            <li> Really a great buy and would definitely consider Hot Tools for future purchases!</li>
            <li> I usually love Hot Tools brand, they make great quality products but there is something wrong with this seller.</li>
            <li> She said she like it very much.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this curling iron to anyone who wants curling their hair to be done quickly and professionally :)</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting easy and more natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> Has different heat settings and is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This particular device was recommended to me by my coworker and a friend and so far I am pretty satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This is a really neat product for people who want to have that spiral curl look!  </li>
            <li> then section it off bottoms out first.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and we plan to return it since she got burned the first time she tried to use it.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t really experimented with it much, but I love it so far.  </li>
            <li> They are great quality and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This is my first wand and also my first ceramic curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Would buy Hot Tools again.</li>
            <li> I also have short hair and it makes really cute waves</li>
            <li> It also has this metal wire stand not to damage the surface you are putting hot curler on.</li>
            <li> This curling iron allowed me to style my hair exactly like I have been wanting it to look for years.</li>
            <li> From the first time I tried it (even though it took some getting used to with the glove and all)</li>
            <li> At the advice of a stylist friend of mine I ordered and ultimately fell in love with this curling wand.</li>
            <li> I did burn my thumb on the first go but not since.</li>
            <li> product just the Hot Tool</li>
            <li> it is faster and easier for me to use the hot curlers.  </li>
            <li> I was glad I got it though, because it gives a different and softer look, when I want it.</li>
            <li> I became a fan of Hot Tools Products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hot.</li>
            <li> this hair wand works better than a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from hair straightener as a curler, barrel curling iron, rollers, hot rollers, but nothing holds the curls in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a Hot Tools straightener that has lasted me forever</li>
            <li> I figured I would try another Hot Tools product.</li>
            <li> This curling iron gives a more similar look to what people achieve with a straightener who use it as a curling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it took me 15 min on my first</li>
            <li> I have never owned a curling wand before this is the first one I have used</li>
            <li> I like the temperature adjustment for how hot you want it</li>
            <li> created the look I was going for, on the first try.</li>
            <li> The first day my daughter used it, she curled her hair in the morning for school</li>
            <li> a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;One note: When you first slip your hair off of the wand it will look like a crimped corkscrew curl.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair so much body and volume and the waves stay all day!</li>
            <li> but this thing gets so hot</li>
            <li> It takes me about 10-15 minutes to curl my entire head of hair and, astonishingly, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend definitely!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of reseach on different cermaic wands, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li> This Hot Tool was recommended to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really encourage you to check them out and see how they hold it to get your bearings!</li>
            <li> This works &amp; heats pretty fast!</li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> a lot of time and money &amp; exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> ....thought they&#x27;d be a bit bigger, but I absolutely love them...</li>
            <li> Also has a great temperature setting , I have long hair and it only took fifteen minutes to curl all of it .</li>
            <li> I thought it might take her a while to get the hang of it, but she got it with the first try.  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> So after using it for the first time, here&#x27;s what helped me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used the glove the first time, but it just gets in the way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally my hair uncurls after an hour or two, but they stay for a whole day or longer with NO hairspray!</li>
            <li> - i&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a good curling iron</li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair and this transforms it to loose wavy curls that I love!</li>
            <li> I mess them up a little after letting the hair cool as I like the beachy look over perfect curls.  </li>
            <li> The temp control is a little loose and placed in an area where it gets changed as you curl, but all in all works great!</li>
            <li> Not only is this super cheap, it works wonder on my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to try it some more, but honestly for the results, I&#x27;d rather use my Infiti Curl Secret, which seems to get rid of the frizz on my hair because of hot plates on my side of my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To get decent and consistant curls with this iron, my hair cannot dry on its own</li>
            <li> After reading and watching hundreds of reviews for clipless curling irons/wands, I decided on this one, since I have had good experiences with Hot Tools in the past.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy hot tools products, they last me a lifetime and are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It curls quickly and the curls hold for at least two days without hairspray (much more effective than a regular curling iron).</li>
            <li> but if you have long hair i would suggest you get a longer one without rubber on top</li>
            <li> Thanks soo much!</li>
            <li> The hot glove really helps to make this product easier to use.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t usually hold a good curl, but with this, it will hold the curl for days.</li>
            <li> I would say my only true critique is that I don&#x27;t agree with the reviewer who said she was worried about using without the traditional curling iron wand with handle holder and found it super easy and intuitive to adjust.</li>
            <li> - very easy to use and the glove helps me with all other curling irons that I have.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an easy to use curling iron.</li>
            <li> I also made the mistake of trying to do too large of sections.</li>
            <li> I have natural waves but they aren&#x27;t very pretty.</li>
            <li> The wand does get very hot and I used maybe 350f so far.</li>
            <li> I like more of a loose curl</li>
            <li> Easy and fast curls that last all day!!</li>
            <li> I love hot tools and i wont buy any other brand..</li>
            <li> I have other Hot Tool products and love the temperature control on their products.</li>
            <li> Actually curls my rather fine hair unlike curlers with the clasp ever did.</li>
            <li> We have tried different styling tools and this works the best for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair!</li>
            <li> This device does not have a clip and is pretty slippery, as well as this particular conical shape that you can see in the image.</li>
            <li> This curling wand not only heats up quickly but also allows you to control the temperature so if you have thick hair, it works great.  </li>
            <li> The Heat glove works nicely and is a little scratchy, but helps a bit.</li>
            <li> I have not used the glove yet and to be honest did burn myself just a little once, but that&#x27;s not the end of the world.</li>
            <li> Really a great buy and would definitely consider Hot Tools for future purchases!brush the curls out with a flat brush.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest looking into the gold plated ones by hot tools</li>
            <li> This item arrived fast and as advertised.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t burn myself.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had a ceramic iron that cost $150, not wanting to spend that much I went with this tine</li>
            <li> I always used curling irons with clips before, but I heard so much about these clipless ones that I had to try it out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> works like an absolute charm.</li>
            <li> If it broke on me, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be as much of a loss, and I wanted to give the brand a try.</li>
            <li> The hair always wants to slip to the thinner end.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would make that much of a change</li>
            <li> but it really does.</li>
            <li> The ceramic coating protects your hair from too much damage.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but my hair holds very well when I use this rod.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t really need to don the glove.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t really need to.</li>
            <li> They are really helpful.</li>
            <li> This really prevents burning.</li>
            <li> It does very well.  </li>
            <li> Lightly spray the curls when you&#x27;re done, and 15 min later run your fingers through to loosen them.  </li>
            <li> My hair wants to stay straight</li>
            <li> It is very inexpensive for the end result.</li>
            <li> but I have not used it much because my hair seems to slip away from it</li>
            <li> Lightweight, swivel cord, heats up incredibly fast - literally</li>
            <li> Shipped so fast</li>
            <li> Works fast.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the glove at all, I found it to be much easier without it</li>
            <li> I couldnt get the hang of the glove really</li>
            <li> You also really need to use the glove so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t fool with my hair all that much...</li>
            <li> Much easier than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> but i read reviews here and thanks for them</li>
            <li> gently tousled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get used to using this wand versus a regular curling iron but the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works better than any other I have tried on my straight hair.</li>
            <li> another tip that might&#x27;ve helped hold the curl the 2nd time: When you&#x27;ve got the curl on the barrel, 20 secs was good like the other person reviewed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a MUCH better price than any other website or supply store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how people use it without it, maybe it takes more practice!</li>
            <li> and I like it better than any other brand.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and I can do loose waves in my hair easily.</li>
            <li> You can make them even more relaxed/beachy by pulling straight down on each section after curling it.</li>
            <li> I have soft long, fine hair that refused to hold a curl until I tried the Hot Tools wand.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and was able to make long, bouncy curls on the first attempt!</li>
            <li> Great for my hard to curl Asian hair!</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate, year around.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine and even if I curl it with hot rollers, by the end of the day my hair just has a slight wave.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and the curls actually stay.</li>
            <li> so you have a place to rest a finger and keep it steady.</li>
            <li> did a lot of research on different brands, and decided this hot tools wand looked pretty comparable.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, and the curls hold until the next day for me.</li>
            <li> It quickly went back.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nice that it comes with it, but if you are careful while using the iron, the glove isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and the curls last!  </li>
            <li> the iron gets VERY hot, so definitely use the glove).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wand.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I never had good second day hair (looked greasy and flat even with dry shampoo and curling again), but now I actually think my hair looks better the second day.</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough, is easy to use and the curl stays all day long.  </li>
            <li> Very easy and as a mother of two small children...</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in a hurry I don&#x27;t bother sectioning, but sectioning does give a little more volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Hot Tools iron is sleek and light-weight; It heats fast and works well, but I would not recommend this particular iron to someone who was looking to curl their entire head (and doing it them self!).</li>
            <li> It was a little different to get use to compared to a regular iron, but the curls turn out great.  </li>
            <li> Works fast and so far haven&#x27;t burnt my hand.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how fast I could curl my hair with this curler.</li>
            <li> Mind you, I have only used it once, just to play around with it real fast.</li>
            <li> Also the curl stays in my hair all day without hair spray and that&#x27;s a lot to say for my hair because before I could never get curls to hold normally by the time I got all the way done it was already falling out .</li>
            <li> There is no clip to hold hair against the curling iron like a normal one.</li>
            <li> Regular curling irons would always damage my hair too, so pretty much stopped using them.</li>
            <li> As my hair is so long, I prefer to not have 5 full curls in each strand before the end of my hair</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, stays hot, and the curl actually holds without any spray needed!</li>
            <li> I watched a few youtube videos on how to use this type of curling iron and was glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the largest size (1 1/4), and my hair is baaarely able to just wrap around it (however I am planning on getting a hair cut to get a few inches off).</li>
            <li> I set it to 330 degrees, use heat spray, roll the hair, set for about 8 seconds, then hold the curl for a few more seconds (w/o the iron).</li>
            <li> If you want thin spiral curls, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I live in South Texas and the humidity is is really high and</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that is easy to use for my long straight hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an easy hair tool to use and the curls last all day!</li>
            <li> The key is to let the curl set in your hand right after you release it.</li>
            <li> Use the glove and switch hands from left to right</li>
            <li> One of the first times I used it, I looked like I kept the first 4 incles of my hair straight, curled the next 7, and left the bottom 2 inces</li>
            <li> You need to hold it a certain angle (Skinnier end facing down, not up) on each side to get the right curl, and just like any beauty technique takes some practice!</li>
            <li> Lastly, do not forget to put some kind of product in your hair (research separately, as I am doing it now) as it all depends on your hair, not this curler, how long the curls will last.</li>
            <li> I WAS NOT GOING TO BUY ONE OF THESE NEW TAPERED CURLING IRONS.  </li>
            <li> I have straight, coarse hair that does not hold curl very well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this wand after researching similar products around and have to say, it&#x27;s put that smooth curl back in my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried using it without blow drying my hair smooth (my natural hair is a fairly tight curl) and it really smoothed the frizz out.</li>
            <li> She was also able to cut down her &amp;#34;curling time&amp;#34; from 1 hour to 20 minutes too!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve typically just blow-dried smooth and put hot rollers, but my hair has gotten so long that they no longer stay in or give much of a curl anyway.</li>
            <li> story short:  Curls hold very well, even for fine/thin hair!</li>
            <li> I recently got curlers and after several weeks, finally the curls started looking better as I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The curl lasts several days and this is a much better price than other irons I have seen out there.</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone seems to love this iron.</li>
            <li> so I was very pleasantly surprised when it lasted all day, then some!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> and it looked exactly the same by the end of the school day!!</li>
            <li> And, it gets hot enough to keep my hair curly all day.</li>
            <li> me literally ten mins to do my whole head, if you&#x27;re thinking about getting it, don&#x27;t think!</li>
            <li> I received it and it took me like 15 minutes to get used to it other than that it is the only curling wand/iron that helps my hair stay curly for two days :)</li>
            <li> I did put on the glove after burning my hand a little, but it&#x27;s easy to hold with the glove on.</li>
            <li> but the little stand to support it broke off rather easily..</li>
            <li> and its so light not a problem to hold upside down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of product in my hair and these curls stay pretty tight even when I only use some light hair mousse.</li>
            <li> Bought this iron, and though the heat glove was MIA, it was fairly easy to use (I watched a few Youtube tutorials before ordering the iron).</li>
            <li> It is very different from regular curling (iron) devices and it takes learning to do it as it has no clip, but the end result is really cool.</li>
            <li> My first thought about it was that it was super weird to use, since I&#x27;ve been only curling my hair with a straightener, but after some time of getting the hang of it I really enjoy it!</li>
            <li> I wish the barrel was a little thicker, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> Be sure to hold the hair around the iron for several seconds to get a long lasting curl that holds.</li>
            <li> I did order the larger one because my hair is long, and I like the big curl look more.</li>
            <li> When I bought it, I was really hoping to find an iron that gave me large loose curls.  </li>
            <li> I also love the black and white look.</li>
            <li> It has different heat settings and it definitely heats up quick.</li>
            <li> Wish they made a large size for bigger curls.</li>
            <li> I have major issues curling my hair with a normal curling iron</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I changed my mind and paid a little extra for this one.</li>
            <li> NATURAL</li>
            <li> So far I like it a lot, and would recommend it to anyone contimplating on buying this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This wand makes my hair really shiny and the curls stay well into the next day.</li>
            <li> TONS of compliments and the husband said WOW.</li>
            <li> Now, I have used the wand multiple times and its much easier.</li>
            <li> I use Hot Tools Marcel Irons often for work, but this iron is not professional grade.</li>
            <li> Took a few days to feel comfortable holding it</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my 14yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been doing hair professionally for over 20 yrs.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m coming around and as far as the tool goes</li>
            <li> old.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable if you are getting it for personal use.</li>
            <li> I did a YouTube review and how to use tutorial if you want to see it in action.</li>
            <li> so we switched to the old fashioned curler.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how the curls stayed.  </li>
            <li> and I find using this spray makes brushing out your hair later much, much easier.</li>
            <li> I recently received this wand and after using it a few times I can say that I love it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that refused to hold a curl for more than an hour but after 4 hours it looks like I just finished curling.</li>
            <li> My hair hits right below my boobs, and it is hard to wrap my longer pieces to fit in entire barrel</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, it down to my bum, and was worried this might not be able to handle all my hair..</li>
            <li> it was well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> I have hair all the way down my back, and I am able to curl my entire head in 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything from sponge rollers to hot rollers to traditional curling irons of various barrel sizes.</li>
            <li> I returned this item because it does not get hot enough and the barrel is too short.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would suggest is getting a hot tools wand that is the same thickness throughout, hair tends to slide up on the contoured ones like these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought another similar item but the glove only covered the thumb and first two fingers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the glove it came with (too scratchy and bulky) and take my chances with using my bare hands with the iron- so far no injuries (knock on wood).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works just as fast as a hair straightener and you wont need a ton of hairspray to hold the curls for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that typically is very time consuming to style.</li>
            <li> I used the glove the first time but find I didn&#x27;t need it if I was careful after that.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> my hair is really thin, fine, and straight</li>
            <li> I would also highly recommend using the included glove the first few times around.</li>
            <li> I would also highly recommend using the included glove the first few times around.</li>
            <li> At first it was pretty confusing to use it, but you can watch a bunch of youtube videos or just invent your way to do</li>
            <li> I got the biggest barrel (1.25&amp;#34;) because I have long hair and like the way bigger, softer curls look.</li>
            <li> use clips and clip up the part that is already wavy (never to the top of my scalp or the waves look weird) and the clips really help.</li>
            <li> I was deciding between this product and the Remington brand, but with the Remington brand, I didn&#x27;t like how the thin one was too thin, and the fat one was too fat, so I figured this was the perfect in between product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Hot Tools curling irons</li>
            <li> We have other Hot Tools that we use and like the brand.  </li>
            <li> Normally when she uses a curling iron, her hair is flat by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to from the traditional curling iron, but SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> The only small downside is that the glove rips fairly easily, but that could just be my fault.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this thing, her curls last all day long (as long as it is dry outside, got 2 more it worked so well.</li>
            <li> Very hard at first figuring out how to wrap hair around the iron doing it on yourself, but once you get the hang of it, it works so much better than your typical curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Fast and long lasting curl.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it last for long as you never know with technologies.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still not so fast with them</li>
            <li> but it took barely anytime.</li>
            <li> So far, my daughter is the only one that has used this.</li>
            <li> I can barely feel the heat through the glove (don&#x27;t be fooled-</li>
            <li> It is time consuming, and, I still use my regular curling iron for the underneath layer of hair (especially in the back where you cannot see) to get all they straight ends smoothed out and/or turned under.</li>
            <li> I bet it would damage thinner hair if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as big and round but still looked cool, like</li>
            <li> Cools down fast, too!</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit of a learning curve and takes a few tries to get right, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> I recommend letting your hair dry naturally, or with a blowdryer for a bit and let it finish drying naturally.</li>
            <li> By the time I finished my whole head, the curls had relaxed into big defined loose curls.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, I&#x27;m not great with hair but can do this!</li>
            <li> At first it was a little tricky to use</li>
            <li> I point the tapered end down and wrap large pieces of hair around the iron.</li>
            <li> It can make loose waves if you start with your hair high on the barrel and hold for only a couple seconds, then brush out.</li>
            <li> My go-to is to blow dry straight, do the tight ringlets, add a bit of Moroccan hair oil, and then gently brush the curls out with a flat brush.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me for a few years, and I used it a lot.</li>
            <li> personally really like that it is made from nano ceramics which suppose to damage your hair less, also it has regulated heat for your type of hair (can be used around the house for all types of hair).</li>
            <li> I bought the large curling wand because I had had a friend use a smaller one on my hair in the past and the curls were much too tight and made my hair appear even more thin.  </li>
            <li> You can do large sections for big waves or little sections for tighter curls.</li>
            <li> I have really straight hair that typically needs tons of hair spray and will only hold a curl for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> and I have to pull it strait with my large round brush while blowdrying.  </li>
            <li> This particular product cuts your blow drying time down and it helps detangle your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, fairly thin hair that generally curls fairly easily</li>
            <li> The middle of my strand of hair would look great, and then torwards the end it just got all weird and wonky looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had pretty limp, long hair and struggled to get even a wave thta lasts.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants tight curls, beach curls or even just a wave!</li>
            <li> If you want very soft waves, you can take larger sections and hold for less time.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is the only thing that would make long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> I finally grew my hair out long enough that I wanted to get a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Heated up fast had tight and loose curls</li>
            <li> The barrel seems shorter than the tapered irons I have used in the past, which mean that I had to curl the top section, then the bottom section of each piece of hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thing hair and usually doesn&#x27;t hold curl well</li>
            <li> so much use it everyday now!  </li>
            <li> It has worked when my hair was short, and still works now with my hair being long.</li>
            <li> I definitely need to use the heat resistant glove to help wrap my long hair around the barrel.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to bring waves into my hair when it falls flat.  </li>
            <li> Curls do last a long time, would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have long hair with several layers cut throughout.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every technique and tool under the sun to get big loose curls and this wand finally delivered.</li>
            <li> and I can have soft big waves in about 10 min or tight curls in about 25.</li>
            <li> After spending $150 on a product which only lasted for a short time, I was pretty annoyed and didn&#x27;t want to shell out the same amount to have that happen again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do recommend using Kenra Platinum Blow Dry Spray or something similar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a lot of hair and it&#x27;s naturally very curly, thick and somewhat coarse.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick (and long) hair</li>
            <li> I no longer need it since I&#x27;ve figured out my hand placement, but I got cocky after a few tries and wound up with more than a few burns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I no longer need it since I&#x27;ve figured out my hand placement, but I got cocky after a few tries and wound up with more than a few burns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this curling iron creates curls that hold very long and are quick to make.</li>
            <li> With my old curling iron, I&#x27;d have to hold my hair in for like a minute at the highest heat setting, and even with hairspray, it will all fall out in a few hours.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s long.</li>
            <li> You might get a couple minor burns while you are learning, but please just throw the glove away.</li>
            <li> This is a long review</li>
            <li> But I would suggest for really long hair.</li>
            <li> Holds all day long.</li>
            <li> You can use a lot of hair or a little hair and depending on how tight you want the wave/curl is how much you&#x27;ll wrap around.</li>
            <li> but I had tried to just use my old curling iron to create the curls I wanted however they would droop and look rather sad, so after searching online, I finally decided to purchase this particular product.  </li>
            <li> I have super wavy, thick, frizzy hair that has brown ombre down to blondish highligheted ends and am probaby due for another Keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> THE LAST PERSON TO CUT MY HAIR EVEN SAID THEY WOULD NOT BUY ONE SINCE I ALREADY HAD OTHER CURLING IRONS.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned by multiple other reviewers you will get beachy waves.</li>
            <li> I followed the other reviews and hope you do the same!</li>
            <li> My hair stays curled all day long!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair though</li>
            <li> Curling my hair has always taken very long until I got this product.</li>
            <li> My curls stay for days if I don&#x27;t wash my hair (using dry shampoo to keep the oiliness at bay).</li>
            <li> I did not blow dry my hair at all</li>
            <li> I waited for my hair to be dry before curling.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;d use a regular hair curler with a springy clip and the curls would last no more than an hour, and that&#x27;s after using a decent amount of hairspray too.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 15 min to do my big head of long hair.</li>
            <li> I did not burn myself which was a small victory, however, I couldn&#x27;t get my ends to look naturally curled.  </li>
            <li> I only roughly played with the wand and did not put any product in my hair other than heat protectant.</li>
            <li> Like those loose beach waves......</li>
            <li> but in the past there were times when I would try to curl my hair with a normal curling iron and my hair just would NEVER come out right; not to mention it was just difficult for me over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Curls are waiver with this wand and you are less likely to damage your hair than with a clamp curler.</li>
            <li> trick (that I was taught) is to wash your hair the night before, put mousse in it while it&#x27;s wet and blow dry it without brushing it</li>
            <li> (looks a little too fancy), so I like bigger curls.</li>
            <li> Go to bed with it like that - it will look a little tangly and big but just go with</li>
            <li> My hair is shorter - a little above my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I got it two days later with my Amazon Prime and a little cheaper than they&#x27;re sold in store for.</li>
            <li> Now I am not pro yet, and it is still a little awkward to use for me, but in time and some practice I know I&#x27;ll love using it.  </li>
            <li> I know people have written that smaller sections give you ringlets, but I want a looser wave and have trouble getting my strands wrapped around the length of the wand.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron a few months back after someone recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> It did take a couple of tries to get used to curling my hair this way, but</li>
            <li> This product suits my needs and keeps my stick-straight hair curled for longer than expected.</li>
            <li> I attempted it with the glove once &amp; it made the curling process a lot harder than it needed to be.</li>
            <li> If you want Shirley Temple ringlets, take 1 inch sections and hold about 12 sec.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a hair girl</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS NATURALLY WAVY AND THICK.  </li>
            <li> If you are used to a curling iron it is a bit different but after a few tries you will get the hang of not having the clamp.</li>
            <li> It gets super-hot in seconds, has an extra long cord with a rotating base so there aren&#x27;t knots/tangles, and it&#x27;s really easy to use</li>
            <li> This curling iron heats quickly (expected), and because you wrap your hair starting at the least porous part of the hair shaft, is does not take long to set a curl.</li>
            <li> With a regular curler, my hair would usually fall flat within a few hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use in my case ONLY because my hair is very long</li>
            <li> It is a little confusing, especially since I never used a traditional curling iron before, either.</li>
            <li> The other one was terrible but this one is amazing!</li>
            <li> With the other curling irons, I could curl my hair and just within seconds in the humidity, the curls are gone and it is frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of curling irons and straightener</li>
            <li> Other then that I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> The narrow end is maybe a few milimeters smaller than the wide end.</li>
            <li> I use a long comb &amp; a few clips and start on one side &amp; go around to the other clipping off as you go.</li>
            <li> Creates curls that last for days and my hair usually does not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> Other than that she does like it.</li>
            <li> so you must be very careful to avoid burning yourself.)</li>
            <li> I have straight, medium to thin Asian, hair that is a few inches past my chest.</li>
            <li> besides the fact that it comes with a glove for me not to burn myself..its like nearly impossible to burn yourself the bottom tip doesnt heat up and its a pretty big tip too so less burns.</li>
            <li> back is hard to curl, my arms were sore.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I bought this looking for the largest barrel I could find, and still wish it was wider.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been wanting a small tapered curling iron for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Curls last for at least 3 or 4 days on virgin hair weaves.  </li>
            <li> it is not worth it at all</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and keeps its body all day and even to the next if i sleep on it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair that falls past my chest.</li>
            <li> It took me about a half hour to do my whole head, since I have thin hair...then sprayed with hair spray and voila!</li>
            <li> and it was hard to curl my hair because other curling irons used to burn my ends, for long hair  </li>
            <li> so it dramatically cuts down on hair-prep-time.</li>
            <li> You need a lot of patience and practice to get it down.</li>
            <li> and you press down your finger on your hair to avoid burning yourself.</li>
            <li> That never happens with other curling irons!  </li>
            <li> I might spray a little hairspray or gloss when I&#x27;m done, but other than that</li>
            <li> so you can rest your finger on the end and its not hot!</li>
            <li> have A LOT of thin hair, if that makes sense.. a thick full head of long hair, but the individual strands are thin and delicate.</li>
            <li> Other curling irons would give me a spiral and then go limp in 30 mins.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very heavy hair and this curling iron still works.</li>
            <li> WELL I CAN&#x27;T DO THE LOOSE CURL WITH MY SMALL STRAIGHTENING IRON</li>
            <li> MY HAIR TYPICALLY DOES NOT HOLD CURL, BUT THIS TOOL GIVE ME THE DESIRED CURL</li>
            <li> This is my second one as I used the first one in Europe without a converter. :(</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews I purchased.</li>
            <li> Or it can make tighter- prom style curles if you use it the typical way.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get used to because there is nothing to hold the hair down when you curl, so you have to use your hands/fingers.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t take me that long to curl it with this wand.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t know the technique for this type of iron, but I got really frustrated, really quick.</li>
            <li> I tease my roots a little and spray with hair texturizer on the scalp an heat protection spray on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wished that the curling iron was a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> The glove provides a little assistance, but not a heck of a lot.</li>
            <li> The Michael Jackson glove is a little embarrassing to wear, but once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> All I have to do is curl my hair and put a little bit of hairspray.</li>
            <li> and I wish the barrel was a little wider throughout.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice but once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice, but once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> They always appeared a little dangerous, but they do produce a little different look then the traditional clamp.</li>
            <li> have stick-straight Asian hair, so the strand itself is very thick.</li>
            <li> It comes with a glove, but I find that hard to work with, so be careful of your fingers if you skip it as well.</li>
            <li> I have coarse thick hair and even while using the glove I had a hard time curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Holds curls longer than curling iron but it takes a few times to get use to using it.</li>
            <li> I have a few burns to go along with it.</li>
            <li> I did a few touch ups before heading out to brunch with the girls</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday...  </li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get used to it since there is no clip to hold the hair, but you&#x27;ll get it.</li>
            <li> use it everyday</li>
            <li> It cools for a few seconds in your hand and will stay all day.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I watched a few youtube videos showing how to use it.</li>
            <li> You want to do about an inch wide of sections and hold it for at least 8-10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive to try this product because sometimes I find it hard for my hair to hold a curl with other tools.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled to not have to put my hair up into a boring bun from my usual dreaded bed head.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the glove does not prevens the user from getting burned if they are not quick enough.</li>
            <li> When I curled my first section of hair with this I almost stopped, because it looked like a bad curling iron curl.</li>
            <li> Making it impossible to get large diameter curls.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling wand for my teenage daughter who has VERY thick hair that is hard to curl.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be beneficial if it was at least a half inch to an inch longer.</li>
            <li> Instead, the user is expected to use the thin glove for this.</li>
            <li> I am not skilled at all with curling my hair but when ever I use this product</li>
            <li> but now I use it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> Hair kept getting caught on glove and the overall product was just difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It takes lots and lots of practice and I would suggest twisting small clumps of hairs at a time.</li>
            <li> No more crimp line from irons</li>
            <li> and i was anxious to try it out.</li>
            <li> I was honestly disappointed after my first use</li>
            <li> Since, this iron doesn&#x27;t have a clip, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to reach the back of the head.</li>
            <li> (And I have small hands to begin with.)</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I use this curling wand almost everyday!</li>
            <li> My hair is long and very straight (AKA boring).</li>
            <li> While this wand does have a small learning curve, it is very small.  </li>
            <li> I have really straight and relatively thin hair that is almost impossible to curl.</li>
            <li> I never use the glove as it&#x27;s too hard to hold your hair with</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is so hard to curl</li>
            <li> I thought it would be hard to learn with no clamp</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to grasp and hold the hair while using this curling iron because of the material of this glove.</li>
            <li> The glove was a nuisance and hard to grab hair sections with.</li>
            <li> This is a hard curling iron to use.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had a hard time learning to use to tool.</li>
            <li> She curled it late at night and when she woke up, it was still curly.</li>
            <li> Get informed before you get it and write a negative review.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this curling wand, and she will probably never own another curling iron after using it.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do that, or at least I haven&#x27;t figured out how to make that happen.  </li>
            <li> I use this at least twice/week to spice it up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a learning curve with this wand (for me at least).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not that complicated.</li>
            <li> And i have really thick hair</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard to keep the hair down at the base for larger curls</li>
            <li> It find it very difficult to use a regular curling iron because it always drops the shorter layers.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is a couple inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have relatively long, crazy frizzy hair and this iron</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scratchy and very small.</li>
            <li> Really, I can&#x27;t say anything bad about the product except that I feel it is difficult to use.</li>
            <li> but there were some serious design flaws.</li>
            <li> Seriously the no heat tip is what sold me.</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to, so the glove does protect you from getting seriously burned.</li>
            <li> think the only reason it got any bad reviews was because those people are used to curling irons which has a clip and wands don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> I threw it away because it is itchy and irritating.</li>
            <li> (Note: the glove is poor quality</li>
            <li> but I found it really frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these irons and the one they sent me was broken.</li>
            <li> I got a little to frustrated with this, so it&#x27;s put away for now.  </li>
            <li> Ladies, this is the secret!</li>
            <li> Think Victoria&#x27;s Secret catalog hair ladies!</li>
            <li> and the glove is useless.</li>
            <li> I have difficult to curl hair, and this iron worked well.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for one of these tapered curling irons, you&#x27;ll will not go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I use it with a teasing comb (around the crown of my head) to get expensive salon like styling.</li>
            <li> , your arms to not get tired!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a weird fabric</li>
            <li> After using this, I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very lazy and bad at doing my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a dangerous product.</li>
            <li> The glove is included, so if you are afraid to burn your fingers, then use it.</li>
            <li> So it is not fair that I give it a bad review because I don&#x27;t know how to use it!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of these types of products</li>
            <li> but I was sick of burning my finger, the glove helps while maneuvering this iron</li>
            <li> cause my puppy got ahold of it :(</li>
            <li> The picture showed the glove, but my did not come with one :(</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid I will melt it!</li>
            <li> So disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This is a very awkward position for me because i can&#x27;t see the curls and where the wand is.  </li>
            <li> The glove is stupid.</li>
            <li> I hate the dent the clips leave at the bottom of my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Glove is nearly worthless.</li>
            <li> Get it, you will not be disappointed!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>

            <li> Holds curls longer than curling iron but it takes a few times to get use to using it. I don&#x27;t even use hairspray.</li>
            <li> This is a really neat product for people who want to have that spiral curl look!  It comes with a glove to protect you from the heat though the iron gets very hot.  I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my curls after using it, and the curl lasts for hours. It helps to spray with hairspray after curling, Bumble &amp; Bumble has a great City Spray that keeps it shiny, or Redken hairsprays always work well.</li>
            <li> I have super wavy, thick, frizzy hair that has brown ombre down to blondish highligheted ends and am probaby due for another Keratin treatment.  I have tried this thing several times because of all the glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get decent and consistant curls with this iron, my hair cannot dry on its own and I have to pull it strait with my large round brush while blowdrying.  I tease my roots a little and spray with hair texturizer on the scalp an heat protection spray on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then section it off bottoms out first.  This is a very awkward position for me because i can&#x27;t see the curls and where the wand is.  I also feel I can&#x27;t get all my hair onto the wand.  I know people have written that smaller sections give you ringlets, but I want a looser wave and have trouble getting my strands wrapped around the length of the wand.  I also need to practice getting the wand closer to my scalp and holding onto that end piece.  One of the first times I used it, I looked like I kept the first 4 incles of my hair straight, curled the next 7, and left the bottom 2 inces uncurled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to try it some more, but honestly for the results, I&#x27;d rather use my Infiti Curl Secret, which seems to get rid of the frizz on my hair because of hot plates on my side of my hair.</li>
            <li> My go to favorite curling wand and at such an amazing price! My hair has never been able to hold a curl. I tried my sisters curling wand and it actually curled my hair and the curls LASTED! This is the second one I have purchased from amazon and will never buy a different brand. I only had to replace my last one cause my puppy got ahold of it :(</li>
            <li> It does the job...doesn&#x27;t curl it as much as I would like it to, but it&#x27;s good enough. Should bring two gloves instead of one.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied! Loved using this! It does it all!!! Enjoy it !!!!!!!!! RESTOn, VA Fine haired beauty. love love love</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice, but this is one of the easiest curling irons/wands to use. It seems to work well on all types of hair, from coarse/wavy hair to thin/straight hair. Be sure to wear the glove in the beginning to prevent burns!</li>
            <li> This item arrived fast and as advertised. Daughter is happy and that means that I am happy with my purchase and I would recommend this item to others.</li>
            <li> great wand, works just like the rest of my hot tools curlers.</li>
            <li> works super great, holds your hair all day/night!!! I do not use the glove, however the wand does get super hot. I have a few burns to go along with it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got me this hair wand for Christmas this year and let me tell ya, I have no idea how I lived without it lol. It curls my hair so well and quickly . Also the curl stays in my hair all day without hair spray and that&#x27;s a lot to say for my hair because before I could never get curls to hold normally by the time I got all the way done it was already falling out . Even with hair spray. So needless to say I love love love it !</li>
            <li> This is a dangerous product. There is no clip to hold hair against the curling iron like a normal one. Instead, the user is expected to use the thin glove for this. Unfortunately the glove does not prevens the user from getting burned if they are not quick enough. I bought this for my wife and we plan to return it since she got burned the first time she tried to use it.</li>
            <li> Great iron - works well and heats up fast and makes nice curls and waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will burn you a couple times before you get used to using a wand...when you do you will be happy you did. I never use the glove as it&#x27;s too hard to hold your hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice if the designers made the cool plastic tip of this iron a different color so you knew where the heat started and the cool area ended - otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> Love the wand, work great. However the glove was not in the package...</li>
            <li> Best curling wand out there!</li>
            <li> Very hard at first figuring out how to wrap hair around the iron doing it on yourself, but once you get the hang of it, it works so much better than your typical curling iron.  Advice watch the video on hottools.com on how to do your own hair using the iron.</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally wavy/curly hair and I like to do my hair sometimes for a different look or more clean style.  I bought the large curling wand because I had had a friend use a smaller one on my hair in the past and the curls were much too tight and made my hair appear even more thin.  This larger size is perfect!  I&#x27;ve only used it twice so I haven&#x27;t really experimented with it much, but I love it so far.  After washing and blow drying my hair, I curled it with this and went out for date night with my boyfriend.  Even when I woke up the next day, my hair was still curled!  That never happens with other curling irons!  I was so thrilled to not have to put my hair up into a boring bun from my usual dreaded bed head.  I did a touch up when I got home later that day and my hair still looked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short:  Curls hold very well, even for fine/thin hair!</li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair and this transforms it to loose wavy curls that I love! Super easy to use; I haven&#x27;t used the glove yet. I am a minimalist when it comes to doing anything with my hair, so this was a big deal for me and I&#x27;m so glad I went for it!</li>
            <li> I love Hot Tools products!  They are great quality and last a long time.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.  This curling wand works great.  This is my first wand and also my first ceramic curling iron.  The ceramic is better for your hair and also holds the curl better.  I am in the process of switching to all ceramic irons and they are all Hot Tools!</li>
            <li> This wand works great! Heats up quickly and the curls actually stay. Best price I&#x27;ve seen and Hot Tools doesn&#x27;t seem to disappoint.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> this curling iron is super easy to use. my hair is really thin, fine, and straight but it will hold the curl for about 2 days. i don&#x27;t even use hairspray. well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Wished that the curling iron was a little bit longer. I have to wear the glove provided to prevent myself from getting burned. It worked though. My hair stayed curl for around 3 days.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS HAIR WAND!!!</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate, year around. With the other curling irons, I could curl my hair and just within seconds in the humidity, the curls are gone and it is frizzy. Not with this curling iron. It stays all day, and into the next if I don&#x27;t shampoo the next day. You may have to touch up after you sleep on it, but even with a touch up, it&#x27;s looks good. I have to use the glove though, or I burn my thumb.  I am so glad I bought it, and wanted to let others know how well it works. Get it, you will not be disappointed!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron a few months back after someone recommended it to me. I could not be happier. I have fine straight hair that&#x27;s pretty easy to damage. In the past, I&#x27;d use a regular hair curler with a springy clip and the curls would last no more than an hour, and that&#x27;s after using a decent amount of hairspray too. Regular curling irons would always damage my hair too, so pretty much stopped using them. Then I tried this curling iron and I was in love almost right away. It did take a couple of tries to get used to curling my hair this way, but once I figured it out, it was pretty easy. I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of product in my hair and these curls stay pretty tight even when I only use some light hair mousse. These days it only takes me about 10-15 minutes to curl my hair in the morning and the curls stay on until the end of the day. I am also very happy to see that this iron does not damage my hair as it heats it all evenly. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I WAS NOT GOING TO BUY ONE OF THESE NEW TAPERED CURLING IRONS.  I ALREADY OWN 3 HOT TOOLS CURLING IRONS OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND TWO WIGO STRENGTHENERS.  THE LAST PERSON TO CUT MY HAIR EVEN SAID THEY WOULD NOT BUY ONE SINCE I ALREADY HAD OTHER CURLING IRONS.  WELL I CAN&#x27;T DO THE LOOSE CURL WITH MY SMALL STRAIGHTENING IRON SO I DECIDED TO FIND ONE OF THESE AND JUST TRY IT.  I LOVE IT.  I HAVE USED IT ALMOST EVERY DAY SINCE I GOT IT.  IT WORKS GREAT, MAKES MY HAIR LOOK GREAT AND CREATES THE LOOK I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED.  MY HAIR IS NATURALLY WAVY AND THICK.  THIS MAKES NICE WAVES THAT LOOK NATURAL BUT LAST ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> Gets very hot!! works well. Would buy Hot Tools again.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works better than any other I have tried on my straight hair. The curls hold all day, gradually loosening up to a nice wave. I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends!</li>
            <li> Great product, you can change the temperature which is good for any type of hair, and it comes with a heat-proof glove which is pretty handy but I don&#x27;t use it because it doesn&#x27;t grip my hair as good, but overall great product. I also have short hair and it makes really cute waves/curls</li>
            <li> Was hoping to love this.  it is ok.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me - but I tend to burn my scalp, ear and face with this thing.  The glove provides a little assistance, but not a heck of a lot.</li>
            <li> It was really great for my daughter&#x27;s asian hair. She curled it late at night and when she woke up, it was still curly. The Heat glove works nicely and is a little scratchy, but helps a bit. You can&#x27;t grab big chunks of hair and expect it to curl, but smallish to medium bits will work wonderfully. Very pleased. My daughter&#x27;s hair is so hard to curl and she was delighted when it held wonderfully. We didnt get it for 35 dollars, but rather for 12.99 at LOTLESS in Manhattan, where they had this curling iron, as well as some huge three barrel wavers and all sorts of wonderful products. They were ALL ONLY 12.99!!!</li>
            <li> I recently got curlers and after several weeks, finally the curls started looking better as I got the hang of it. I used this taper curling iron for the first time today and my hair turned out great. The curls are pretty defined even after holding sections for about 20 seconds, but after wearing my hair in a bun for a 25 minute walk to work, the curls had loosened slightly, but now 8 hours later, they&#x27;ve held great and my hair feels really good. I washed my hair 2 days ago but even without freshly washed hair, it looks really nice. I did put on the glove after burning my hand a little, but it&#x27;s easy to hold with the glove on. I debated between getting this size and the 1 in and i think this one was the right call as the curls are pretty defined so I wouldn&#x27;t want them any smaller/tighter. Overall, very good purchase, impressed at how easy it is to use and that you don&#x27;t need to hold your hair in very long to have the curls stay in.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  I can get perfect curls that last all day long!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The size is perfect and it&#x27;s very userfriendly. So glad I bought it! I Love it!</li>
            <li> In the past I have owned about two curling irons and a straightener from hot tools and each time they have been the best. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of curling irons and straightener but they just didn&#x27;t cut it for me. I was never satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wand curler is perfect and easy to use. It came with a glove and I used it for one or two curls but after that I decided I didn&#x27;t need it and I really didn&#x27;t burn myself. I like that the tip of this curler isn&#x27;t heated so you have a place to rest a finger and keep it steady. It has different heat settings and it definitely heats up quick. The curl is gorgeous. The only thing I would change is the length of the wand. I think it would be beneficial if it was at least a half inch to an inch longer. Other then that I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself time and buy it!</li>
            <li> I did use plastic curlers and my moms old curling iron many years ago, so this is my first device and experience with modern curling tools after a bit of time of not using any. This particular device was recommended to me by my coworker and a friend and so far I am pretty satisfied with it. It is very different from regular curling (iron) devices and it takes learning to do it as it has no clip, but the end result is really cool. As mentioned by multiple other reviewers you will get beachy waves. Get informed before you get it and write a negative review. This device does not have a clip and is pretty slippery, as well as this particular conical shape that you can see in the image. At first it was pretty confusing to use it, but you can watch a bunch of youtube videos or just invent your way to do it.&lt;br /&gt;I personally really like that it is made from nano ceramics which suppose to damage your hair less, also it has regulated heat for your type of hair (can be used around the house for all types of hair). I have not used the glove yet and to be honest did burn myself just a little once, but that&#x27;s not the end of the world. The glove is included, so if you are afraid to burn your fingers, then use it. It also has this metal wire stand not to damage the surface you are putting hot curler on. Lastly, do not forget to put some kind of product in your hair (research separately, as I am doing it now) as it all depends on your hair, not this curler, how long the curls will last. Good luck.</li>
            <li> works well maybe for shorter hair people but if you have long hair i would suggest you get a longer one without rubber on top</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had a ceramic iron that cost $150, not wanting to spend that much I went with this tine and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Alright so I&#x27;ve been wanting a curling wand for the longest time, so when I saw this available on amazon I knew I had to get it. ( hot tools is definitely best of the best) so I received it super fast ( thank you amazon prime) and immediately began using it when I got it. My first thought about it was that it was super weird to use, since I&#x27;ve been only curling my hair with a straightener, but after some time of getting the hang of it I really enjoy it! Now I am not pro yet, and it is still a little awkward to use for me, but in time and some practice I know I&#x27;ll love using it.  So far I like it a lot, and would recommend it to anyone contimplating on buying this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S&lt;br /&gt;Using this on my hair doesn&#x27;t leave that burnt scent that my straighter left, so that&#x27;s an extra plus! My hair looks super smooth and shiny not dried up and frizzy!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls hair nicely. Wish it came it a wider width. Can&#x27;t complain, it works great! Cools down fast, too!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! it is my new favorite toy. The curl lasts several days and this is a much better price than other irons I have seen out there.</li>
            <li> Makes the best curls, even with hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curls. This wand is better than any curling iron.</li>
            <li> Ladies, this is the secret! I have tried everything from sponge rollers to hot rollers to traditional curling irons of various barrel sizes. NOTHING gives my hair beautiful waves like this product. I have natural waves but they aren&#x27;t very pretty. This curling iron allowed me to style my hair exactly like I have been wanting it to look for years. And they last! I did my hair last night before a night on the town, and then this morning it was still curly. I did a few touch ups before heading out to brunch with the girls but it took barely anytime. I recommend letting your hair dry naturally, or with a blowdryer for a bit and let it finish drying naturally. I did not use any products, only a touch of hairspray when I was finished. You can do large sections for big waves or little sections for tighter curls. I recommend this product to anyone who wants beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> I always used curling irons with clips before, but I heard so much about these clipless ones that I had to try it out. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It does have a little bit of a learning curve and takes a few tries to get right, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy. I don&#x27;t like the glove it came with (too scratchy and bulky) and take my chances with using my bare hands with the iron- so far no injuries (knock on wood).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stick-straight Asian hair, so the strand itself is very thick. With my old curling iron, I&#x27;d have to hold my hair in for like a minute at the highest heat setting, and even with hairspray, it will all fall out in a few hours. I don&#x27;t even have to crank the heat up all the way with this curling iron and I only have to hold my hair around it for maybe 15 seconds so it dramatically cuts down on hair-prep-time. I got the biggest barrel (1.25&amp;#34;) because I have long hair and like the way bigger, softer curls look. After I curl one side of my head, I run my fingers through a couple times to break up the curls and give texture, and then lightly spray with hairspray to hold the shape. My curls stay for days if I don&#x27;t wash my hair (using dry shampoo to keep the oiliness at bay).</li>
            <li> My hair usually does not hold curl very well but with this curling iron I don&#x27;t even need any hairspray and it holds all day! Best product ever! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, it works great and the curls hold for much longer than anything else we&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It curls quickly and the curls hold for at least two days without hairspray (much more effective than a regular curling iron). I find that after you twist the hair it takes 5-10 seconds for the curl to set on the medium setting. The glove is stupid. I threw it away because it is itchy and irritating. I think it is better to just develop the habit of keeping a safe distance with your fingers. I&#x27;ve been burned once or twice but it wasn&#x27;t a huge issue, and I learned quickly much like Skinner&#x27;s rat. I wish they had a larger size available-- I purchsed the 1 1\4  but I sometimes like larger waves.</li>
            <li> (This review is based on 1st straightening my hair and then curling it) I was a little apprehensive to try this product because sometimes I find it hard for my hair to hold a curl with other tools. I&#x27;d given up on curling irons and had started using my flatiron to get curls. Not anymore! From the first time I tried it (even though it took some getting used to with the glove and all) I&#x27;ve had wonderful results. I&#x27;m Puerto Rican. I&#x27;ve got a lot of hair and it&#x27;s naturally very curly, thick and somewhat coarse. Other curling irons would give me a spiral and then go limp in 30 mins. This wand makes my hair really shiny and the curls stay well into the next day. I might spray a little hairspray or gloss when I&#x27;m done, but other than that I don&#x27;t use any products with it. Doesn&#x27;t seem that I need to.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand &amp; the glove that came with it. I get so many compliments on my hair when I use this tool. Very easy to use &amp; it gets hot very quickly!</li>
            <li> At the advice of a stylist friend of mine I ordered and ultimately fell in love with this curling wand. It&#x27;s easy to use, quick to heat, gives excellent results and is a great deal. The curls I get from this wand last all day WITHOUT needing to gunk up my hair with styling products. A+</li>
            <li> works like an absolute charm. every time i use it everyone asks me how i got my hair to look so nice! Im a hair dresser and i approve!</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone seems to love this iron. I did like the temperature dial, and it seemed to heat evenly and quickly- but there were some serious design flaws. The barrel seems shorter than the tapered irons I have used in the past, which mean that I had to curl the top section, then the bottom section of each piece of hair. The taper is also almost non-existant. The narrow end is maybe a few milimeters smaller than the wide end. The curl did not hold well in my hair. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> While this wand does have a small learning curve, it is very small.  After watching a video or two on youtube, I found that the wand was very easy to use and gives you great wave in your hair that lasts all day.  I have fine hair so I especially love that you can adjust the temperature.  It heats up quickly which is also a nice feature.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! I finally found a product that is easy to use for my long straight hair.</li>
            <li> This gives you awesome loose curls that stay in all day. Think Victoria&#x27;s Secret catalog hair ladies! TONS of compliments and the husband said WOW. My best friend said my hair looked \\&quot;so romantic\\&quot;. I thought it would be hard to learn with no clamp but it&#x27;s easy. I did burn my thumb on the first go but not since. It&#x27;s super fast to do hair that&#x27;s long. The glove is ridiculous but you won&#x27;t use after the first go around anyway, when you get the hang of how best to do it. I use a long comb &amp; a few clips and start on one side &amp; go around to the other clipping off as you go. Wrap a pice of hair around it &amp; hold the last bit, wait 15 seconds &amp; done! Wish I found this years ago!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had pretty limp, long hair and struggled to get even a wave thta lasts.  I wash my hair the night before and in the morning split into 4 medium size sections and curl - not product just the Hot Tool... it&#x27;s amazing, it takes 10 mins at most to do and can easily last a second day!</li>
            <li> I liked the wand, but being that my hair is so much longer it is faster and easier for me to use the hot curlers.  I was glad I got it though, because it gives a different and softer look, when I want it.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair after using this curling iron! My hair doesn&#x27;t usually hold a good curl, but with this, it will hold the curl for days. I have very long, very heavy hair and this curling iron still works. I&#x27;ve had other Hot Tools curling irons and I love them, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have really straight and relatively thin hair that is almost impossible to curl. This tool worked like magic and it let me have the curls that I wanted. Definitely would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this for myself so I can&#x27;t give a synapsis of how it works.  But I can tell you that if it didn&#x27;t meet all expectations this person would have let me know.  Look good in the box!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my T3 curling wand which broke within months of purchase (along with the one I got to replace it, but that&#x27;s another story). After spending $150 on a product which only lasted for a short time, I was pretty annoyed and didn&#x27;t want to shell out the same amount to have that happen again.&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research on different brands, and decided this hot tools wand looked pretty comparable. If it broke on me, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be as much of a loss, and I wanted to give the brand a try. Honestly this iron is JUST as good as the one I was replacing (which cost over 4x more). It heats up quickly, and the curls hold until the next day for me. If you are looking for a good quality, tapered curling wand I would not hesitate to recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This wand works fine but the tapered barrel really makes curling hair a pain. The hair always wants to slip to the thinner end. Making it impossible to get large diameter curls. If you want thin spiral curls, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Watch makeupbytiffanyd on YouTube. She has great tutorial on how to use this kind of iron. Love it.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron! Not only is this super cheap, it works wonder on my hair. My hair curls perfectly with no frizz with this iron, even my hair stylist uses it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product suits my needs and keeps my stick-straight hair curled for longer than expected. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who asks!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this curling wand, and she will probably never own another curling iron after using it.  We both think it does a better job than a curling iron, and it seams to be easier for her also.  She has had this about 2 years or so, and it is still working well.  She does her hair curly about 1/3 of the time I&#x27;d say.  Her hair is naturally curly, but she is able to do much larger curls with this, and the curls have more character and I don&#x27;t know what word to use, but they are more model-quality curls.  Gorgeous.</li>
            <li> My hair curls so well with this. I am not skilled at all with curling my hair but when ever I use this product I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t know the technique for this type of iron, but I got really frustrated, really quick. I have coarse thick hair and even while using the glove I had a hard time curling my hair. It quickly went back.</li>
            <li> Woks great! Holds curls until the next day. Wish they made a large size for bigger curls.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE THIS CURLING WAND. MY HAIR TYPICALLY DOES NOT HOLD CURL, BUT THIS TOOL GIVE ME THE DESIRED CURL AND IT HOLDS FOR DAYS! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS WAND TO EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> Product came in quickly from seller, within 5 days. It works great and heats up very fast, within 1 minute it was hot enough for use. The barrel is perfect in width but the length is a bit too short, and i have shoulder length hair. But i make it work, curls still come out nice. 4 stars for the short barrel.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s the BEST iron I ever used. Is an excellent product. I became a fan of Hot Tools Products. It&#x27;s really hot.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this thing, her curls last all day long (as long as it is dry outside, got 2 more it worked so well.</li>
            <li> this hair wand works better than a standard curling iron. I have thick hair and keeps its body all day and even to the next if i sleep on it. Works just as fast as a hair straightener and you wont need a ton of hairspray to hold the curls for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> curls quickly, heats up quickly, great design, makes beautiful curls.  worth the price, my 13 year old thinks it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> My sister told me to stop using metal curling irons and switch to a ceramic iron. I didn&#x27;t think it would make that much of a change but it really does. The ceramic coating protects your hair from too much damage. The curls stays longer too. This is a great iron.</li>
            <li> So far, my daughter is the only one that has used this. She loved the curls it made.</li>
            <li> I regret this purchase.  My hair was about shoulder length, and I felt like my hair was too short to curl.  I went back tO my regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the cool Mom now for introducing her to this curling iron.  It is easy on her fine hair and holds the curl beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Curls are waiver with this wand and you are less likely to damage your hair than with a clamp curler. Can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron.  It was a little different to get use to compared to a regular iron, but the curls turn out great.  When I bought it, I was really hoping to find an iron that gave me large loose curls.  This doesn&#x27;t do that, or at least I haven&#x27;t figured out how to make that happen.  But, it does give a nice curl and the next morning, my curls are still rockin&#x27;.  I haven&#x27;t used the glove once, it&#x27;s nice that it comes with it, but if you are careful while using the iron, the glove isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect curling iron and this is definitely it! I love hot tools and i wont buy any other brand.. This makes curls/waves that stay in my hair for days and heats up super fast.. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is a great curling wand! I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t take me that long to curl it with this wand. The curls also last and look amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand. Everything I was looking for. Creates curls that last for days and my hair usually does not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> If you want those perfect ringlet curls, this curling iron does the trick without burning and drying out your hair. Be sure to use a protective spray on your hair before using this product. Also, I would suggest using the glove that comes with it. My hair holds a lot of heat, and so I can accidently burn myself from using this iron on my hair. The glove is a great additional bonus because of how you use this to curl your hair, however, the texture of the glove makes it easy to catch on stuff and it&#x27;s hard to grasp and hold the hair while using this curling iron because of the material of this glove. Otherwise, I think it&#x27;s worth it. Be sure to hold the hair around the iron for several seconds to get a long lasting curl that holds.</li>
            <li> This curling rod works amazingly!!&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is for sure worth it. I have very thing hair and usually doesn&#x27;t hold curl well but my hair holds very well when I use this rod.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! The wand heats up quickly and does a great job with curl. You can do a variety of curls depending on how you hold the barrel and where you wrap you hair on it. The cord end has a nifty swivel on the device end so you don&#x27;t get tangled up. I used the glove the first time but find I didn&#x27;t need it if I was careful after that. I have burned myself once w/o though - so use your own judgement.</li>
            <li> Super versatile, you can do many different types of waves or curls. This was recommended by a coworker and I use it everyday...  I&#x27;m so happy with it and it&#x27;s a MUCH better price than any other website or supply store. If you&#x27;re thinking about it, just do it... you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> Love it! it works amazingly and heats up really fast! my hair stays curled all day, even until the next day</li>
            <li> This wand is absolutely amazing!! I had to practice with using it, but now that I know how to use it, it is great!! My hair is a little bit longer than my shoulders and this wand makes the most beautiful curls. I can now have lovely springy curls when I want!!</li>
            <li> I love the curl this gives my hair. It took a little while to get used to because there is nothing to hold the hair down when you curl, so you have to use your hands/fingers.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair wand! I love it and highly recommend this wand! A bunch of girls at work recommended it and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever owned! It heats up quickly is so easy to use! But best of all, the curls actually stay in place with NO hairspray. That&#x27;s right.. no hairspray. The curls actually stay intact until you wash your hair so you can sleep on it and wake up with the same hair you went to bed with. I&#x27;ve never had a better hair tool in my life!</li>
            <li> Works great! I love it!</li>
            <li> Heats up perfectly, only burnt myself twice (ha), but the little stand to support it broke off rather easily..oh well.</li>
            <li> Works good. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I am a lefty and this was a task for me to learn how to use this I burned my arm, but I learned right away the curls are perfect and the trick is to be patient but overall great buy!</li>
            <li> This is the only curling iron that would hold my curls. I&#x27;ve tried everything from hair straightener as a curler, barrel curling iron, rollers, hot rollers, but nothing holds the curls in my hair. This curling iron is the only thing that would make long lasting curls! In my opinion, this is definitely worth a go!! Try it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this curling wand to arrive. I have long, fine, straight hair and the curls held pretty good. They lasted ALL day without the use of hairspray. The first time I used the wand, it took me quite some time to curl my own hair. Now, I have used the wand multiple times and its much easier. Just takes some time getting used to. Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li> Really nice! Very adjustable and easy on your hair.</li>
            <li> The Michael Jackson glove is a little embarrassing to wear, but once you get the hang of it you don&#x27;t really need to don the glove.  Works great on my daughters thinner hair, originally bought it for me (much thicker hair) and it hasn&#x27;t gotten great results on mine.</li>
            <li> This wand makes it so easy to curl your hair! The curls hold all day and it only takes about 15 minutes to do. It comes with a glove but I have never used it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand! I have really straight hair that typically needs tons of hair spray and will only hold a curl for a short period of time. I have used the wand 3 times and each time it came out amazing. I don&#x27;t need to use hair spray and the curls last after sleeping with them. Looks great the next day! If you are used to a curling iron it is a bit different but after a few tries you will get the hang of not having the clamp. The curls are beautiful! Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> My hair has never held curls until this! Takes me 15 minutes max - and my hair stays all day. Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Curls hold &amp; are full &amp; bouncy.</li>
            <li> bought for my sister.. she loves it..</li>
            <li> Love this! Recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> Love thus wand, curls great and the more you use it the easier it becomes. So happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used this when I had longer hair and it curled perfectly. I don&#x27;t use it as much now that i&#x27;ve cut a good amount of length off but still gives bouncy curls. I don&#x27;t use the glove it came with, it just seemed to get in the way. It also looks like a body exfoliating glove..</li>
            <li> I just received this product today but I was so excited to use it I actually tried it on my lunch hour in the work bathroom. It was incredibly easy to use and the curls are soft, shiny and bouncy. I have thick hair that refused to hold a curl for more than an hour but after 4 hours it looks like I just finished curling. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this iron!! It has worked when my hair was short, and still works now with my hair being long. Makes nice waves that everyone is always looking for! It takes a few times to get used to it since there is no clip to hold the hair, but you&#x27;ll get it. It comes with a glove, but I find that hard to work with, so be careful of your fingers if you skip it as well. You can use a lot of hair or a little hair and depending on how tight you want the wave/curl is how much you&#x27;ll wrap around. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Heats up in under 30 seconds and my hair looks so good from using this! It is very easy to use, I&#x27;m not great with hair but can do this!</li>
            <li> My hair is long and very straight (AKA boring). I use this at least twice/week to spice it up. Depending on how I use it, I can get a lot of variety from it. It definitely works to put curl that stays in my hair all day (still there when I wake up in the morning). My only complaint is I bought this looking for the largest barrel I could find, and still wish it was wider. As my hair is so long, I prefer to not have 5 full curls in each strand before the end of my hair (looks a little too fancy), so I like bigger curls. Still, my hair looks gorgeous with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the glove is useless. You might get a couple minor burns while you are learning, but please just throw the glove away.</li>
            <li> I have a Hot Tools straightener that has lasted me forever and I love the way it works, so I figured I would try another Hot Tools product. Great choice. I love this curling wand. I didn&#x27;t use the glove that came with it ever and you don&#x27;t really need to. If you&#x27;ve never used a curling wand before, YouTube some videos. They are really helpful. Great price for this brand as well versus somewhere like Ulta.</li>
            <li> I have straight, coarse hair that does not hold curl very well.  After reading and watching hundreds of reviews for clipless curling irons/wands, I decided on this one, since I have had good experiences with Hot Tools in the past.  This one did not disappoint!  It gets super-hot in seconds, has an extra long cord with a rotating base so there aren&#x27;t knots/tangles, and it&#x27;s really easy to use once you get the hang of it.  The best part are the really natural-looking, beachy curls/waves I get from the tapered shape in record time that actually STAY in my hair until I wash it.  Dream iron!!</li>
            <li> Bought this iron after a friend recommended it to me.  I have difficult to curl hair, and this iron worked well.  I hate the dent the clips leave at the bottom of my hair so this was great.  I definitely need to use the heat resistant glove to help wrap my long hair around the barrel.  I&#x27;m not sure how people use it without it, maybe it takes more practice!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been wanting a small tapered curling iron for a long time.  We have other Hot Tools that we use and like the brand.  This was a good price and works well - my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to decide if and what curling iron product to buy. I had heard good things about curling \\&quot;wands\\&quot; in general, i.e. the curling iron without the clip. I looked and heard great things about the CHI products, and I have one of their straightening irons. However, they are not budget-friendly, so I decided to give this one a try. I had heard good things about hot tools because of the temperature control. I LOVE this feature. It allows you to control the heat and helps keep you from getting burned. This curling wand, unlike some others, has a cool tip. This really prevents burning. I haven&#x27;t burned myself yet, and I haven&#x27;t used the glove. The tapered end gives versatility because you can create tighter curls or looser waves. It is definitely a looser look than a traditional curling iron. It creates waves more so than ringlets. If you are going for true ringlet curls, I would not suggest this product. It DOES give you a look that you see a lot of celebrities with--loose waves, great for layered hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST part--it&#x27;s easy! I had heard there was a big learning curve with curling wands, but my first time using it was so easy! I am a low-maintenance hair person, so I&#x27;ve been looking for something that is faster and easier. It is very easy to use and to learn how to use, which I found surprising because it usually takes me longer. For example,I&#x27;ve been trying to curl my hair with the CHI straightener as many people do, but I have not been able to get it with practice. This curling iron gives a more similar look to what people achieve with a straightener who use it as a curling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I followed the other reviews and hope you do the same!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, it down to my bum, and was worried this might not be able to handle all my hair.. It does very well.  I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s fine.  Amazingly my hair holds the curls / waves!  My hair never holds curl all day... I refuse to use hairspray so I was very pleasantly surprised when it lasted all day, then some!  Also this gives my hair great body.  Note: after curling I just run my hands through my hair then perfection.</li>
            <li> I returned this item because it does not get hot enough and the barrel is too short. I use Hot Tools Marcel Irons often for work, but this iron is not professional grade. I would not recommend it. I ended up spending the extra $60 for the HAI wand instead; it works great!</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand! Heats up quick and makes beautiful beach waves! Took a few days to feel comfortable holding it but now I use it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> After years of trying every product under the sun, I finally found it!  This is the easiest, fastest tool with the best results I&#x27;ve ever seen. I finally can do my hair the way I&#x27;ve always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick (that I was taught) is to wash your hair the night before, put mousse in it while it&#x27;s wet and blow dry it without brushing it (just use your fingers).  Go to bed with it like that - it will look a little tangly and big but just go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then in the morning use the wand!  Lightly spray the curls when you&#x27;re done, and 15 min later run your fingers through to loosen them.  I have pretty thick (and long) hair and it took me 15 min on my first try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> great item! use it everyday</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! Great for my hard to curl Asian hair! My hair wants to stay straight but this thing does the trick. The key is to let the curl set in your hand right after you release it. It cools for a few seconds in your hand and will stay all day. Saw it on YouTube</li>
            <li> WOW! Amazing curling Iron! I looks wonderful. Just bought one more for my friend! :) We both love it. :)</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, the best advice I could give on this product is to use the glove that comes with it. Without the glove you could easily burn your fingers. Overall it is an amazing product and keeps curls in longer than a curling iron</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!! I have been using a straightener for years to curl my hair but this puts much more natural looking curls &amp; waves in my hair. I don&#x27;t need to use hair spray to keep my curls in all day with this curling iron. I&#x27;ve even slept on them &amp; woke up the next morning to them still looking great. I also don&#x27;t use the glove when I curl my hair. I attempted it with the glove once &amp; it made the curling process a lot harder than it needed to be. I just make sure not to touch the barrel which is a lot easier to do than you would think. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting easy and more natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> Curls last for at least 3 or 4 days on virgin hair weaves.  Great gift item for love one or friend.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my 14yr old daughter. The only problem with it is, the picture shows the glove...but it did not come with it! Other than that she does like it.</li>
            <li> This curling wand works great. It is very inexpensive for the end result. I love how you can really customize your curl. The only small downside is that the glove rips fairly easily, but that could just be my fault. I highly recommend this wand.</li>
            <li> Love this tool, getting tons of compliments on my curls. My girlfriends thought I got it done at a salon! Very easy to use once you get the hang of it.Love that the controls are out of the way and I don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off or change the temp setting with my hand. If you are looking for one of these tapered curling irons, you&#x27;ll will not go wrong with this one. Promise.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a curling wand before this is the first one I have used and I love it. It heats up fast, stays hot, and the curl actually holds without any spray needed! Which is rare for my hair. It does make my hair smell like processed hair afterwards but I think that is a given considering what I am doing to it. Maybe there is some product I can put in it before or after to minimize the burnt smell?</li>
            <li> this is the best curling iron that you can find in the market.it curls in seconds and very long lasting</li>
            <li> The glove was a nuisance and hard to grab hair sections with. Hair kept getting caught on glove and the overall product was just difficult to use. I prefer using my straightener to create waves and curls.</li>
            <li> I love this curler. This is my second one as I used the first one in Europe without a converter. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I thought I would love it after my cousin recommending it to me. Her hair looked great. I have to say... I actually prefer the curling irons with the clips. I think it is easier.</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews I purchased. I am not disappointed and think this is a great tool and quality made. I like the temperature adjustment for how hot you want it, that&#x27;s a definite sophistication needed especially for those who care about damaging their hair after prolonged and repeated use. I would say my only true critique is that I don&#x27;t agree with the reviewer who said she was worried about using without the traditional curling iron wand with handle holder and found it super easy and intuitive to adjust. I don&#x27;t, I find it definitely is having a learning curve and I&#x27;ve been doing hair professionally for over 20 yrs. but I&#x27;m coming around and as far as the tool goes it&#x27;s everything it says it is and more!</li>
            <li> This curling iron heats quickly (expected), and because you wrap your hair starting at the least porous part of the hair shaft, is does not take long to set a curl. I have burned many fingers (I don&#x27;t use the glove) but I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve improved a lot. My hair is shorter - a little above my shoulders. The size works great and because there is no clamp I can control how tight the curls are more easily.</li>
            <li> Bought this to bring waves into my hair when it falls flat.  Great device to get the perfect curl for the windswept &#x27;beachy&#x27; look, which is what I was going for.  Works fast and so far haven&#x27;t burnt my hand.  Glove is provided, however, it will &#x27;melt&#x27; if it comes in contact with barrel, but will protect hand from heat.</li>
            <li> This curling wand works great. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it and love the results. Heats up very quickly and with the dial halfway up it is a great temperature for my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling iron!  It&#x27;s amazing.  Has different heat settings and is super easy to use.  I have hair all the way down my back, and I am able to curl my entire head in 10 minutes.  Definitely happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I have soft long, fine hair that refused to hold a curl until I tried the Hot Tools wand. I can style my hair in under 20 minutes and it stays curly all day. I couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> I recently received this wand and after using it a few times I can say that I love it. I have very long, fairly thin hair that generally curls fairly easily and this is great for my hair. I got the 1 1/4 in size and it works great to achieve nice looking waves on long hair. If you have shorter hair I would probably recommend the next smaller size. The curls/waves achieved with this iron last even after a night of sleeping on them. Great product! (Note: the glove is poor quality so I do not use it, however, the wand does get up to 400+ degrees so you must be very careful to avoid burning yourself.)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, and she loved it.  The picture showed the glove, but my did not come with one :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been envious of girls walking around with fantastic curls, because frankly, mine look like crap...and uncurl after an hour. If that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This created the look I was going for, on the first try. I haven&#x27;t used the glove, and remain unburned.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how fast I could curl my hair with this curler. I love it!</li>
            <li> Really, I can&#x27;t say anything bad about the product except that I feel it is difficult to use. If you like these types of irons, then go for it....but I found it really frustrating.</li>
            <li> For ladies with long hair, this iron is great! All I have to do is curl my hair and put a little bit of hairspray. My hair is full and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this curling iron.  I am still getting the hang of using it and making waves in my hair, but it has nothing to do with the iron more with me needing a little more practice. Very happy with the glove because it does get very hot. Curls do last a long time, would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling wand for my teenage daughter who has VERY thick hair that is hard to curl.  Normally when she uses a curling iron, her hair is flat by the end of the day.  This curling wand not only heats up quickly but also allows you to control the temperature so if you have thick hair, it works great.  Really liked the temperature dial feature.  The first day my daughter used it, she curled her hair in the morning for school and it looked exactly the same by the end of the school day!! She was also able to cut down her &amp;#34;curling time&amp;#34; from 1 hour to 20 minutes too!!</li>
            <li> This iron is hot and curls quickly. The curls seems to stay well too. The glove is a nice idea but I have not used it much because my hair seems to slip away from it and I&#x27;m afraid I will melt it! I may look for a smaller silicone glove. I have long hair and was able to make long, bouncy curls on the first attempt! It&#x27;s been fun to play with.</li>
            <li> perfect size barrel for the perfect curls - i&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a good curling iron but this is awesome and really easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is a hard curling iron to use. You need a lot of patience and practice to get it down. The curls are great once you get it.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every technique and tool under the sun to get big loose curls and this wand finally delivered. I watched a few youtube videos showing how to use it. It&#x27;s very easy to get used to and I can style my hair faster with this wand than I could a straightener or curling iron. Even big sections of hair will curl. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments on my hair and even heard it looks like &amp;#34;model&amp;#34; hair.&lt;br /&gt;My technique: I section off the top and bottom portions of my hair and curl the bottom first. I point the tapered end down and wrap large pieces of hair around the iron. When I&#x27;m in a hurry I don&#x27;t bother sectioning, but sectioning does give a little more volume.&lt;br /&gt;The glove works great- I can barely feel the heat through the glove (don&#x27;t be fooled- the iron gets VERY hot, so definitely use the glove).&lt;br /&gt;I have A LOT of thin hair, if that makes sense.. a thick full head of long hair, but the individual strands are thin and delicate. This doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and has managed to make styling a lot of hair a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;One note: When you first slip your hair off of the wand it will look like a crimped corkscrew curl. When I curled my first section of hair with this I almost stopped, because it looked like a bad curling iron curl. By the time I finished my whole head, the curls had relaxed into big defined loose curls. You can make them even more relaxed/beachy by pulling straight down on each section after curling it. I use it with a teasing comb (around the crown of my head) to get expensive salon like styling. Seriously, this is the easiest style I&#x27;ve ever done with my hair and looks the best my hair has ever looked.</li>
            <li> Pros: Lightweight, swivel cord, heats up incredibly fast - literally 30 seconds, good amount of space at the end which isn&#x27;t heated.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: My ends did feel a bit crispy after running this iron through, however, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a much better choice compared to the traditional curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve with this wand (for me at least).  I did not burn myself which was a small victory, however, I couldn&#x27;t get my ends to look naturally curled.  The middle of my strand of hair would look great, and then torwards the end it just got all weird and wonky looking.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because I need practice, especially since 120 other reviewers all claimed to have gotten perfect waves :)</li>
            <li> I love love love this wand! I have used curing irons and have never been able to keep my curls for the whole day or get nearly as much volume as I have with his wand! I love that this wand it has temperature control so you can choose the heat setting you want. My hair never smells burnt after I use it either. It gives my hair so much body and volume and the waves stay all day! It leaves my hair feeling so soft and looks so healthy and shiny! This wand did come with a glove but I don&#x27;t use it. The wand does get very hot but I love the fact that it has a hot free tip so you can rest your finger on the end and its not hot! Seriously the no heat tip is what sold me. I will never go back to a curling iron. At first it was a little tricky to use but I watched some youtube videos to help me see how to use it properly! Trust me use this and you will not regret it! The price was great and I like it better than any other brand. The chi runs about 65 bucks and my roomate has both this and the chi and I tried them both and loved the hot tools! Great investment!</li>
            <li> Looove this curling wand!! Absolute best one I have ever owned! Shipped so fast I got it two days later with my Amazon Prime and a little cheaper than they&#x27;re sold in store for. Thanks soo much!</li>
            <li> I have semi-wavy hair and thought one of these tapered curling wands could help be achieve that &amp;#34;beach - wave&amp;#34; look. It does. It takes lots and lots of practice and I would suggest twisting small clumps of hairs at a time. It is time consuming, and, I still use my regular curling iron for the underneath layer of hair (especially in the back where you cannot see) to get all they straight ends smoothed out and/or turned under. The tapered wand gives the top layer of hair a soft wavy, loopy curl. Use the glove and switch hands from left to right so you are always wrapping hair in same direction on the wand or your curls won&#x27;t match.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron, it is super easy to use and doesn&#x27;t fry your hair. It heats up nicely, but I would recommend buying a different glove. This is not a glove that can be held to the iron. I recommend getting one that can withstand the heat and not melt.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for something reasonably priced with great results. I have long hair that typically is very time consuming to style. This curling iron gets up to 400 degrees and I can have soft big waves in about 10 min or tight curls in about 25. Because there is no clamp- it doesn&#x27;t fry the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand. The cool tip makes it so it is a lot easier to use without burning myself. And, it gets hot enough to keep my hair curly all day.</li>
            <li> I do have a Conair 1&amp;#34; tapered wand, it works just as great, but this wand gives me the bigger curls that I wanted. It does take some getting used to, so the glove does protect you from getting seriously burned. I did order the larger one because my hair is long, and I like the big curl look more.</li>
            <li> This is a game-changer. My hair has never held curl before. I have VERY thick hair but this thing gets so hot I bet it would damage thinner hair if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tool for a couple of months now and have been very pleased with it. Heats quickly and my hair tends to hold the curl for a while. I did buy the largest size and it works well with my hair(my hair is waist-length). I am not that great at styling my hair but I haven&#x27;t had a hard time learning to use to tool. I  have not had a problem burning my fingers. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this wand!! I had never used one before and needed one that got super hot since my hair is coarse and likes to do its own thing! This one gets REALLY hot!!! I have other Hot Tool products and love the temperature control on their products. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants tight curls, beach curls or even just a wave! I have done them all with this wand and it just depends on how hot it is set at and what product you use!</li>
            <li> This curling iron gives you those curls that you wish you had. Like those loose beach waves......&lt;br /&gt;This does just that. I have very long hair though and I wish the barrel was a little wider throughout. Never burned myself, the glove works great. Works fast. No more crimp line from irons</li>
            <li> I bought this iron after seeing similar ones displayed at the mall (with a much larger price tag). I have long hair with several layers cut throughout. It find it very difficult to use a regular curling iron because it always drops the shorter layers. I have no had this problem with this wand curler! I think it may be because you wrap your hair around the barrel, rather than winding it up your hair. I find that I have far better control with this and much better results. It takes me about 10-15 minutes to curl my entire head of hair and, astonishingly, it lasts all day. With a regular curler, my hair would usually fall flat within a few hours. After using this iron, my hair lasted through 20mph winds and a light drizzle! I would recommend this iron to any girl! I cant wait to try it on my roommate&#x27;s hair!!!!</li>
            <li> The best curling wand everr.&lt;br /&gt;Takes me literally ten mins to do my whole head, if you&#x27;re thinking about getting it, don&#x27;t think! just buy it amazing purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only reason it got any bad reviews was because those people are used to curling irons which has a clip and wands don&#x27;t.Either that or they don&#x27;t know how to correctly use. I love this product and would recommend definitely!</li>
            <li> I got a little to frustrated with this, so it&#x27;s put away for now.  Perhaps once my hair gets longer, it will be easier to use.</li>
            <li> The hot tool is very easy to use, and is quick!  If you can use a curling iron, you should be able to use this!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter in law.  Saw her at a New Years Eve party and her hair looked very nice.  She said she like it very much.  She is 23 yrs. old.</li>
            <li> The wand is great, but I&#x27;d recommended they put the size in the ad. i was a bit smaller than I wanted</li>
            <li> This curling wand is wonderful.  Heats up quickly and the curls last!  I don&#x27;t even use hairspray anymore.  I did a lot of reseach on different cermaic wands, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  I really don&#x27;t understand how so many reviewers are saying they burn themselves....it&#x27;s really not that complicated. Just don&#x27;t touch the hot part!!! :)</li>
            <li> Every time I use this product, I always get compliments on how amazing my curls look. it definitely gives it beautiful curls without burning your hair or making it fizzy or too curly. It is a bit hard to keep the hair down at the base for larger curls but I&#x27;ve only used it 2-3 times. I didn&#x27;t use the glove at all, I found it to be much easier without it and you press down your finger on your hair to avoid burning yourself. This product is authentic hot tools and gets hott very fast. I was about to buy the same one at Ulta for $60! I sent my friends all here, a much better deal! The only thing I would suggest is getting a hot tools wand that is the same thickness throughout, hair tends to slide up on the contoured ones like these.</li>
            <li> i received this in the mail a couple days ago and i was anxious to try it out. this product does not disappoint! it&#x27;s fairly easy to use, if you&#x27;re unsure you can always look up youtube tutorials. this gave me gorgeous waves that stayed in all day and even the next day with no hairspray! the glove helps. once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s a lot easier than the clamp curlers. highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Actually curls my rather fine hair unlike curlers with the clasp ever did. very satisfied</li>
            <li> Ive always wondered how some girls do those beautiful wand curls/ or wavy an i finally know!! This curling iron is amazing!!!! And i have really thick hair and it still works on my hair :) my curls last till the next day also. Best curling iron</li>
            <li> The product is lightweight, the cord swivels, and there is an adjustable temperature dial. What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> I always used a regular curling iron to curl my hair and it always went flat or didnt look that great but using this wand my hair looks amazing and stays curled all day long with no touch ups or hair spray. I am so glad i bought this it was well worth the money spent! I couldnt get the hang of the glove really but i havent had any problems with burning myself since i bought it.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Bought a different wand before buying this one. The other one was terrible but this one is amazing! A great buy!</li>
            <li> Works great. I wish I had gotten a fatter, non-tapered one but that is my problem. You also really need to use the glove so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers. It gets hot really quickly which is great when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy hot tools products, they last me a lifetime and are very reasonably priced. These make beautiful beachy waves. I also love the black and white look. I could have kept using my curling iron to do beachy waves but I was sick of burning my finger, the glove helps while maneuvering this iron</li>
            <li> This Hot Tool was recommended to me and I totally love it. Caution it is very HOT so don&#x27;t turn in to high and burn your lovely locks off. It takes a second to get used to maneuvering it but when you do you&#x27;ll love the outcome.</li>
            <li> This has transformed my hair routine! This is a long review but I rarely buy products that truly make a difference like this. I have thick, naturally curly hair that falls past my chest. I&#x27;ve typically just blow-dried smooth and put hot rollers, but my hair has gotten so long that they no longer stay in or give much of a curl anyway. I bought this wand after researching similar products around and have to say, it&#x27;s put that smooth curl back in my hair! This is a really nice quality tool given the ceramic barrel, pop out stand and generously long cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you don&#x27;t look so great the first time, though, don&#x27;t despair- I was honestly disappointed after my first use but it was only because I didn&#x27;t understand how to use the tool correctly. You need to hold it a certain angle (Skinnier end facing down, not up) on each side to get the right curl, and just like any beauty technique takes some practice! There are plenty of Youtube tutorials on curling wands, even using this one specifically. I&#x27;d really encourage you to check them out and see how they hold it to get your bearings! It is a little confusing, especially since I never used a traditional curling iron before, either. Depending on the length of your hair you&#x27;ll have to figure out what works for you. I also made the mistake of trying to do too large of sections. You want to do about an inch wide of sections and hold it for at least 8-10 seconds. Make sure that you are curling AWAY from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing is this is can really give you any look. If you want very soft waves, you can take larger sections and hold for less time. If you want Shirley Temple ringlets, take 1 inch sections and hold about 12 sec. It does everything I need and then some! I&#x27;ve even tried using it without blow drying my hair smooth (my natural hair is a fairly tight curl) and it really smoothed the frizz out. My go-to is to blow dry straight, do the tight ringlets, add a bit of Moroccan hair oil, and then gently brush the curls out with a flat brush. It gives me that perfect, smooth bouncy curl which I prefer and honestly lasts me 3 days easy! The 4th and 5th day I can rock a looser curly ponytail. Depending on the length of your hair you can really experiment with curl size since the barrel is so nicely tapered.  I would also highly recommend using the included glove the first few times around. I no longer need it since I&#x27;ve figured out my hand placement, but I got cocky after a few tries and wound up with more than a few burns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped someone out. Really a great buy and would definitely consider Hot Tools for future purchases!brush the curls out with a flat brush.

            <li> It takes a little while to perfect your technique using this curling wand but when you finally do, the results are amazing! I could never get curling irons to do what I wanted them to do, until now. It takes me about 20 minutes to curl my hair. It&#x27;s such an easy hair tool to use and the curls last all day! I love it!</li>
            <li> Great tool. My Daughte loves it! We have tried different styling tools and this works the best for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair!</li>
            <li> works as advertised i would give 5 stars, but thats reserved for something above and beyond to make me actually &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> just got this today and its the 1st time i have ever used a curling wand. It was very EASY to use. regular curling irons dont curl my hair. this wand gave me beautiful full big curls and it only took me 10 minutes! so glad i bought it and its a great price. it comes with a glove which is great but i didnt even need to use it!</li>
            <li> This works &amp; heats pretty fast! When I got it, I tried it on my girls and they love it! The temp is super hot, but curls in 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> Love it, accurate with description and expectation.</li>
            <li> The attachments are fun and I am so glad that I changed my mind and paid a little extra for this one.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Had to buy 2</li>
            <li> works great and heats fast. my daughter loves it as well. Cant imagine life without it. I wish my 2 in curling iron worked this great.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic, so happy I ordered.  Heats up quick and curls fine/thin hair very well.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot!  I&#x27;m very lazy and bad at doing my hair.  But this tool makes it easy, you don&#x27;t have to be precise, and I don&#x27;t have to make it very hot to get the effect I want.  It&#x27;s just time consuming.  Hoping it lasts a while!</li>
            <li> Love love love my curling wand. So easy to use and makes beautiful curls/waves! Great price too! Definately a great buy!</li>
            <li> A couple months ago, I decided to take a chance on a tapered curling iron. They always appeared a little dangerous, but they do produce a little different look then the traditional clamp. It was actually easy to use once I got the knack (which I had by the end of the first time using). It also works great, however I would not expect a Hot Tools curling iron not to work above decent.</li>
            <li> - very easy to use and the glove helps me with all other curling irons that I have. It takes less than 15 min to do my big head of long hair.</li>
            <li> not the best on the market, but does the job.Price is reasonable if you are getting it for personal use.</li>
            <li> Easy and fast curls that last all day!! You can use various parts of the barrel for different curls, all in all great purchase.</li>
            <li> sets a great curl that holds. there is a learning curve and there is the potential to burn your fingers but once you get the hang of it, it is way easier to use than a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> This Hot Tools iron is sleek and light-weight; It heats fast and works well, but I would not recommend this particular iron to someone who was looking to curl their entire head (and doing it them self!). Since, this iron doesn&#x27;t have a clip, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to reach the back of the head. However, if you&#x27;re a stylist looking for a great iron to use on clients, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li> After I read all of the comments on this product I thought that it would be so good. It was terrible. It did not curl my hair at all. I would not recommend this item to anobody it is not worth it at all</li>
            <li> I really like this! It&#x27;s my first wand and it creates really cute and natural looking waves in my kinky A.A. textured hair.</li>
            <li> Personally I was expecting the barrel to be a lot bigger. I still really love the product and love the curls it makes. It can make loose waves if you start with your hair high on the barrel and hold for only a couple seconds, then brush out. Or it can make tighter- prom style curles if you use it the typical way.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! I honestly haven&#x27;t bought a curling iron for many years, so I was hesitant about buying a new one. I am so glad I did! This gets hot super fast and the curl stays in my hair 2-3 days! It takes a little practice but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s faster. I did a YouTube review and how to use tutorial if you want to see it in action. http://youtu.be/QtYV1cDwtz0</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use this to get nice curls.  I had a friend tried and she couldn&#x27;t either so we switched to the old fashioned curler.  Luckily I rarely curl my hair so I&#x27;m not too bummed.  Probably works well if you have the skills for this kind of curler.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is a couple inches past my shoulders. This is the only hair tool I&#x27;ve found that will very easily make my hair wavy or curly (depending on how you use the wand). My hair also holds the style which I haven&#x27;t ever found in a curling iron before. My hair stylist even complimented my hair one night when I saw her out! The wand was very easy to get used to and I only used the glove once. I would definitely recommend this curling wand!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use it yet.... but when others have used it, their hair turns out great. So it is not fair that I give it a bad review because I don&#x27;t know how to use it!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an easy to use curling iron. I have very thick hair and this curling iron creates curls that hold very long and are quick to make. Curling my hair has always taken very long until I got this product. I also like the way these curls look compared to the curling irons with the clips. It&#x27;s great for the price, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This wand is magical!!!! I love it! besides the fact that it comes with a glove for me not to burn myself..its like nearly impossible to burn yourself the bottom tip doesnt heat up and its a pretty big tip too so less burns. I got this wand as a birthday gift last week and WOW I learned so fast its very easy to work with, the best part is that it heats and cools off really really quuick! The buttons are easyto manage and dont get in the way durning the process...OH! and its so light not a problem to hold upside down, your arms to not get tired! I truly reccomend this wand, its worth every penny!! &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of these types of products but I had tried to just use my old curling iron to create the curls I wanted however they would droop and look rather sad, so after searching online, I finally decided to purchase this particular product.  I ordered it and it arrive on time as promised.  I watched a few youtube videos on how to use this type of curling iron and was glad I did.  I tried it out and it worked the FIRST time!  I was surprised at how the curls stayed.  I mess them up a little after letting the hair cool as I like the beachy look over perfect curls.  It takes me awhile to curl my hair with it as I&#x27;m still learning, but it does a great job.  I did crank up the heat and I ditched the glove.  I was glad I had it for the first time but once I got a feel for the curling iron, I found I didn&#x27;t need the glove anymore.  Great purchase!!  Note: I do recommend using Kenra Platinum Blow Dry Spray or something similar.  This provides heat protection as well as a bit of silicone (so use sparingly).  This particular product cuts your blow drying time down and it helps detangle your hair.  Curly hair snarls quite easily and it&#x27;s winter here so coats and scarves work a number on the layer underneath and I find using this spray makes brushing out your hair later much, much easier.</li>
            <li> It creates a really nice waves &amp; easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Save a lot of time and money &amp; exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I curled my hair after sleeping on it wet all night and it looked amazing! I have relatively long, crazy frizzy hair and this iron made the prettiest curls in no time!!! I love this curling iron!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in LOVE with this curling iron. I&#x27;m not much of a hair girl so I don&#x27;t fool with my hair all that much...but in the past there were times when I would try to curl my hair with a normal curling iron and my hair just would NEVER come out right; not to mention it was just difficult for me over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This here curling iron is so simple to use and convenient! It took me about a half hour to do my whole head, since I have thin hair...then sprayed with hair spray and voila! Curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats quickly. It has different degree settings; I use the lowest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this curling iron to anyone who wants curling their hair to be done quickly and professionally :)</li>
            <li> Shipped fast works great</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me. It is my first curling iron and I love it. I have straight, medium to thin Asian, hair that is a few inches past my chest. I ordered the largest size (1 1/4), and my hair is baaarely able to just wrap around it (however I am planning on getting a hair cut to get a few inches off). I was deciding between this product and the Remington brand, but with the Remington brand, I didn&#x27;t like how the thin one was too thin, and the fat one was too fat, so I figured this was the perfect in between product. Mind you, I have only used it once, just to play around with it real fast. 24 hours later my hair is at the wavy stage. Keep in mind I only roughly played with the wand and did not put any product in my hair other than heat protectant. The wand does get very hot and I used maybe 350f so far. I like more of a loose curl/wave so this product seem to work just fine for that.</li>
            <li> Okay this was my VERY first hot tools curling iron purchased about 4 years ago I loved it! Heated up fast had tight and loose curls whenever always did friends hair with it. BUT!!!!!!!!! Once I got more experienced with my hair (42&amp;#34; thick hair ) I realized I got NO SHINE with this product. Reason why..because I invested in the 24k gold played curling irons! Ulta had them on sale last year so I got a GREAT BOGO deal. So I bought 2 of them 1&amp;#34; 1 1/2&amp;#34; .  They gave me shine with no hair serum or extra products! This one just curls. If that&#x27;s what you want okay... I highly suggest looking into the gold plated ones by hot tools but my review is good because I loved this product for so many years!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product. The first one lasted me for a few years, and I used it a lot. I was happy with how long it lasted. The swivel cord is super helpful- it provides good reach to the back of the head.</li>
            <li> This is my go to hair tool,</li>
            <li> Works well! Very satisfied with this curling iron. It heats up quickly and I love the glove. Curls so easily.</li>
            <li> I received it and it took me like 15 minutes to get used to it other than that it is the only curling wand/iron that helps my hair stay curly for two days :)I have thin hair and it was hard to curl my hair because other curling irons used to burn my ends, for long hair  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes curls. Lasts for a couple days! Easy to use once you get the hang of it. Watch out for finger, ear burns! I suggest watching a couple of how to use videos on YouTube. I love the results!</li>
            <li> Fast and long lasting curl. Perfect as described</li>
            <li> Super cute....thought they&#x27;d be a bit bigger, but I absolutely love them...</li>
            <li> I give this 5 starts because it&#x27;s curls well (my hair is stick straight) and the extra-long cool end is helpful in avoiding burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> Wand is great. It has a cool tip, so you don&#x27;t really need a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glove is nearly worthless. It&#x27;s scratchy and very small. (And I have small hands to begin with.)</li>
            <li> So happy with this purchase , I didn&#x27;t have to use the glove it came with because the iron has a good size tip at the end so no burning my fingers . Also has a great temperature setting , I have long hair and it only took fifteen minutes to curl all of it . I love it !!!</li>
            <li> It died after 4 uses. I usually love Hot Tools brand, they make great quality products but there is something wrong with this seller.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for, works great (:</li>
            <li> I love it....&lt;br /&gt;so easy&lt;br /&gt;so fast&lt;br /&gt;so fav result&lt;br /&gt;my hair looks like the models of victorias secrets!!&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend this to all girls!!!!</li>
            <li> Wanted the wavy look that&#x27;s popular right now. I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine and even if I curl it with hot rollers, by the end of the day my hair just has a slight wave. Bought this iron, and though the heat glove was MIA, it was fairly easy to use (I watched a few Youtube tutorials before ordering the iron). I set it to 330 degrees, use heat spray, roll the hair, set for about 8 seconds, then hold the curl for a few more seconds (w/o the iron). After I&#x27;ve done my whole head, I spray with light hold hairspray and finger comb after a couple of minutes. My hair stays curled all day long! Even waking up the next day, my hair is still curled. I never had good second day hair (looked greasy and flat even with dry shampoo and curling again), but now I actually think my hair looks better the second day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week. Works great, actually easier to use without the glove. Much easier than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.. But I would suggest for really long hair. My hair hits right below my boobs, and it is hard to wrap my longer pieces to fit in entire barrel</li>
            <li> Once I practiced a little and got used to the feel of it, I loved it! Makes the most amazing curls!</li>
            <li> I have major issues curling my hair with a normal curling iron so this was the perfect solution. 1000x easier and makes more natural curls. Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Get hot quickly. It&#x27;s  very good</li>
            <li> The hot glove really helps to make this product easier to use. I haven&#x27;t been able to find another hot glove that works as well.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous. It&#x27;s hard to use in my case ONLY because my hair is very long and I have a lot of it! I showed my fiance how to wrap my hair around it so he does the back of my head! &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;I use clips and clip up the part that is already wavy (never to the top of my scalp or the waves look weird) and the clips really help.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this curling iron for a couple of months and loves it.  I thought it might take her a while to get the hang of it, but she got it with the first try.  She does use the glove to protect her fingers.  This iron gives really pretty curls that are perfect for the teenage set.  Happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> It dose JUST what I need for my hair. Its The Best.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a lot of experience with irons specially with curling ones before but i read reviews here and thanks for them i did a good choice. Hopefully it last for long as you never know with technologies.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still not so fast with them but i feel i can be better with time and patience :)&lt;br /&gt;Big pro of this iron, it does do a natural looking nice curls and doesn&#x27;t look like it damages the hair!</li>
            <li> I finally grew my hair out long enough that I wanted to get a curling iron. I have three kids and no time so I was kind of on the fence with this clipless one. I went ahead and got it.. LOVE IT! I didn&#x27;t have the temp up all the way and left each curl on the wand about 13 seconds and it made beautiful curls. I also purchased clips to hold the parts together. The glove was helpful but ended up taking it off bc it&#x27;s a weird fabric and my hair was sticking to it. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> great product the curls comes out really nice and last all day a must buy and a great price!!! l love this product</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough, is easy to use and the curl stays all day long.  Love it highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these irons and the one they sent me was broken. When I plugged it into an outlet, the iron would not turn on. So disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> After searching forever for a great curling wand, I finally found one that would curl my hair. With the curling wand, it takes more patience in general to be able to hold your hair to the iron without getting burned (the glove is inconvinient since you can only wear it on one hand) but for a teenager or older, it is a great, reliable iron, and I am thankful that I bought it. EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED (:</li>
            <li> For someone like me that usually wears her hair in a ponytail, this is a great product.  My hair dresser recommended it for when I want something different.  Love it so much use it everyday now!  Very easy and as a mother of two small children...its fast too which is important.</li>
            <li> Love this wand! My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl with rollers or a curling iron bit this works great. Holds all day long.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice, but once you get the hang of it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Creates beautiful long lasting waves.</li>
            <li> So after using it for the first time, here&#x27;s what helped me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had clean hair, I used a heat protective product. I did not blow dry my hair at all but I think I should&#x27;ve so the ends of the hair would&#x27;ve had a nice curve. (What happens is that you need to hang on to the end of your hair so it&#x27;s not included in the curling process) I then set the dial at 400. I was scared to fry my hair off! I waited for my hair to be dry before curling. The gloves does help! Use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls lasted about 8 hours. I did put a light hair spray all over to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I loved the curls so much, I wanted it again. So I just brushed out the same hair (didn&#x27;t wash it) then curled it again. The curls held even better! Probably cuz of the hairspray the day before? Not sure. I slept on it and the next day, it held, I just &#x27;fluffed&#x27; it and went to work. Still got more compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh another tip that might&#x27;ve helped hold the curl the 2nd time: When you&#x27;ve got the curl on the barrel, 20 secs was good like the other person reviewed. I did 30 secs cuz my hair is stubborn. After you held the curls in the barrel whatever time works for you, keep holding the end of the tip of the curl then slide the curling iron out. Hold the curl in position for about 10 secs, longer if you can. I think when it cools off a bit, the curl holds that position as it cools and stays longer. Maybe thats why I was able to sleep on it and curls were still fine the next day. It&#x27;s not as big and round but still looked cool, like gently tousled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back is hard to curl, my arms were sore. I&#x27;d get someone to help do the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> After using this, I am obsessed. Takes a little getting used to from the traditional curling iron, but SO WORTH IT! This wand creates gorgeous waves that last for days!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Watch a tutorial on how to use this if you don&#x27;t already know. I learned after trying it once. Used the glove the first time, but it just gets in the way. You just have to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally my hair uncurls after an hour or two, but they stay for a whole day or longer with NO hairspray! I wish the barrel was a little thicker, but it&#x27;s fine. I use this curling wand almost everyday!</li>
            <li> Love this. It heats up fast and I can do loose waves in my hair easily. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, heats up fast and curls stay ALL day. I live in South Texas and the humidity is is really high and my curls last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought another similar item but the glove only covered the thumb and first two fingers. This full glove makes it easy to use and get the ends curled when you have layers. The temp control is a little loose and placed in an area where it gets changed as you curl, but all in all works great!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it creates beautiful waves.  It took me a while to get used to using this wand versus a regular curling iron but the results are fantastic.</li>
