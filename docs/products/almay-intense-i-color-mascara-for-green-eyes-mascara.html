            <li>Makes my eyes stand out more without being clownish.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.....</li>
            <li>One of my favorite mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her favorite</li>
            <li>Looks more brown.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>This would be better if it were more product coming out on the lashes.  </li>
            <li>Not enought produce coming onto the lases in my opinion, to even enjoy the color!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be ordering more often.</li>
            <li>Great maskara, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love the color because it make my green eyes pop, great product for a good price.</li>
            <li>This mascara irritates my eyes and my eyelashes and it lakes easily.</li>
            <li>Fantastic seller</li>
            <li>First, it arrived in original packaging.</li>
            <li>The price made it worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>; However, it does a fine job when it comes to extended the length and size of my natural lashes.</li>
            <li>The color of this mascara is great and hard to find, however it goes on a bit clumpy, hence the three stars.</li>
            <li>Love this product and when applied with a white mascara primer, the color really pops.</li>
            <li>The prompt delivery and low price are the only good things about this order.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the purple actually showing up on my black/brown lashes, but I was super impressed by the results.</li>
            <li>i am very into all of the new colors!!  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Almay brand and settled on this Almay Intense i-Color.</li>
            <li>it seems to really thicken my lashes so much.  </li>
            <li>but when you can&#x27;t find the product in the stores anymore, it doesn&#x27;t really matter, does it?  </li>
            <li>Also, the purple didn&#x27;t show up that much.</li>
            <li>I really took the plunge when buying this product.</li>
            <li>it looks like its brown unless you look at it VERY closely.</li>
            <li>I got the Black Steel and the Emerald Black, and I must say that my eyes were comfortable and my lashes looked nice.</li>
            <li>Sent this item right back where it came from.</li>
            <li>Works well, and does not bother my hyper sensitive eyes!</li>
            <li>My problem is that while is stays on well, it&#x27;s not very thick.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s old.</li>
            <li>Too bad because I loved the color and the price was right</li>
            <li>Sadly it was dry and clumpy but the seller was 100% great in her response.</li>
            <li>Love colored mascaras, although they are hard to find in stores sometimes!</li>
            <li>Compared to the Almay Plum mascara I have, you can barely see it.  </li>
            <li>black is always too gothic and heavy of a mascara for a redhead, such as myself, and i find that it accentuates my own blue eyes without taking away from them.</li>
            <li>&#x27;t tried a second coat, but I barely have time to put it on as is.</li>

            <li> Buy it if you want long lashes, just not purple ones.</li>
            <li> It arrived and i put it on and it is black and black can be, definitely nowhere near the description of &amp;#34;purple amethyst&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Also, it has a tendency to dry out rather rapidly.  </li>
            <li> clumps as it&#x27;s not new.</li>
            <li> this one is an actual amethyst rather than a dark plum.</li>
            <li> actually noticed that the color wasn&#x27;t black or brown.</li>
            <li> When I went to put the wand in, it bounced back at me like dried rubber.  </li>
            <li> item arrived on time and as expected</li>

            <li> and she thinks other women would like it too.</li>
            <li> However, in using the product, I remembered why I quit buying it in the store; it quite often seems too dry even when brand new, making it difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> but when I got this it was a dark purple</li>
            <li> and it looked black</li>
            <li> I have green eyes but</li>
            <li> purple mascara is for green eyes</li>
            <li> As soon as it dried it started flaking.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t dried out or anything like I feared.</li>
            <li> Mascara usually smears and causes discomfort and redness because I wear contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to define that hue, but if that is purple, am staying with</li>
            <li> Hard to find purple mascara.</li>
            <li> The color itself is dull and almost gray looking.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I expected to see purple on my eyelashes</li>

            <li> Works well, and does not bother my hyper sensitive eyes! Reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like?  Purple mascara at this price.  Better than even a drugstore buy. If you like purple this is a very nice shade!</li>
            <li> Mascara usually smears and causes discomfort and redness because I wear contact lenses. I&#x27;ve been looking for a mascara that I could wear without such discomfort. I decided to try the Almay brand and settled on this Almay Intense i-Color. I got the Black Steel and the Emerald Black, and I must say that my eyes were comfortable and my lashes looked nice. I now need to find an eyeliner that will last all day and not smear and irritate my eyes. Hopefully Almay will be the answer for eyeliner as well. If anyone can recommend an eyeliner in the Almay line that won&#x27;t cause eye irritation and won&#x27;t smear, kindly le me know.</li>
            <li> I love anything purple- this one is an actual amethyst rather than a dark plum.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this it was clumpy . Too bad because I loved the color and the price was right</li>
            <li> i am very into all of the new colors!!  the quality of the mascara is the best aswell.  it seems to really thicken my lashes so much.  i&#x27;m  very impressed with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> I loved the color but I guess this was discontinued in regular stores so it&#x27;s been around a while. Sadly it was dry and clumpy but the seller was 100% great in her response.</li>
            <li> The color of this mascara is great and hard to find, however it goes on a bit clumpy, hence the three stars.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product, but unfortunately, the mascara was totally dried up inside.  When I went to put the wand in, it bounced back at me like dried rubber.  No matter how I put it in, I couldn&#x27;t get any liquid out.  Sent this item right back where it came from.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this anymore in the stores and really liked it.  Found it here and it is just the same.  Not any cheaper but when you can&#x27;t find the product in the stores anymore, it doesn&#x27;t really matter, does it?  I have allergies to a lot of make up so when I find something that works for me, I stay with it if at all possible.  This works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> clumps as it&#x27;s not new. it&#x27;s old. I wanted it as I can&#x27;t find in stores any more. I still use it. Hard to find purple mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara irritates my eyes and my eyelashes and it lakes easily. Maybelline mascara is way better. Also, the purple didn&#x27;t show up that much.</li>
            <li> I love Almay&#x27;s amethyst colored mascara....black is always too gothic and heavy of a mascara for a redhead, such as myself, and i find that it accentuates my own blue eyes without taking away from them.</li>
            <li> I had mixed reviews when it came to the 1-5 star review. This product arrived late, and i was really anticipating it, being that i had not come across a purple mascara anywhere in the stores.....It arrived and i put it on and it is black and black can be, definitely nowhere near the description of &amp;#34;purple amethyst&amp;#34; However, it does a fine job when it comes to extended the length and size of my natural lashes. So 4 stars to that, but i would not order again if i was looking for purple. Buy it if you want long lashes, just not purple ones.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful! However, in using the product, I remembered why I quit buying it in the store; it quite often seems too dry even when brand new, making it difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I expected to see purple on my eyelashes and it&#x27;s not even noticeable. The color itself is dull and almost gray looking. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it does lengthen and give your eyelashes volume but that is not what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I really took the plunge when buying this product. First, it arrived in original packaging. I was skeptical about the purple actually showing up on my black/brown lashes, but I was super impressed by the results. It showed up as a deep purple tone &amp; people actually noticed that the color wasn&#x27;t black or brown. Just what I wanted! Makes my eyes stand out more without being clownish. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This mascara is easy to apply and the color is great.  My problem is that while is stays on well, it&#x27;s not very thick.  Compared to the Almay Plum mascara I have, you can barely see it.  I haven &#x27;t tried a second coat, but I barely have time to put it on as is.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.....</li>
            <li> I know that the mascara is for Brown eyes and I don&#x27;t have Brown eyes I have green eyes but purple mascara is for green eyes but when I got this it was a dark purple and it looked black and I&#x27;ve wanted a purple mascara for years and this mascara didn&#x27;t do any thing for me and it won&#x27;t pop out and eye color you have ps this is just my opinion DON&#x27;T BUY THIS</li>
            <li> One of my favorite mascara&#x27;s. Cant find it in town anymore.</li>
            <li> item arrived on time and as expected</li>
            <li> Not sure how to define that hue, but if that is purple, am staying with&lt;br /&gt;other colours.  Also, it has a tendency to dry out rather rapidly.  Pity,&lt;br /&gt;as I&#x27;d wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daugther, she loves it but can no longer find it in stores. It&#x27;s her favorite and she thinks other women would like it too.</li>
            <li> Love the color because it make my green eyes pop, great product for a good price. Thank you very much. ☆☆☆☆</li>
            <li> Great texture. Stays on!!</li>
            <li> Love colored mascaras, although they are hard to find in stores sometimes! Love this product and when applied with a white mascara primer, the color really pops. Would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> The prompt delivery and low price are the only good things about this order. The prodect seems old..stale. As soon as it dried it started flaking. I bought the purple, but the color is so faded it looks like its brown unless you look at it VERY closely. Disappointe.</li>
            <li> Wish it were a darker purple.  Looks more brown.  That&#x27;s ok. The price made it worth a try.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This would be better if it were more product coming out on the lashes.  Not enought produce coming onto the lases in my opinion, to even enjoy the color!</li>
            <li> The product was prompt and in perfect condition. It wasn&#x27;t dried out or anything like I feared. Fantastic seller and I&#x27;ll be ordering more often. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the one mascara I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t turn me into a racoon by the end of the day. It appears to have been discontinued, so I have been buying it wherever I find it.</li>
            <li> Great maskara, highly recommend.</li>
