            <li>This is the best steam cap I ever owned...and I owned every brand there is.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, and excellent for steaming your hair.</li>
            <li>but for the price 20% is a good result</li>
            <li>So put your cap on &amp; throw on your favorite face mask &amp; relax!  </li>
            <li>and they work great and are cheap.</li>
            <li>It does get kind of warm, so I plan to use it more on cooler days.</li>
            <li>Very easy to read description</li>
            <li>MUST PICK HAIR UP TO TOP BECAUSE MACHINE DOESN&#x27;T HEAT AT THE BOTTOM.  </li>
            <li>MOSTLY HEATS ON TOP.</li>
            <li>Works very well and happy with it.</li>

            <li>it is hot and give a good treatment to the hair, but the key is the product that you will use, if you are not using a good quality treatment, it will not work.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to order this heating cap</li>
            <li>I bought this a really long time ago, and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Two parts real mayonaise, one part of your favorite deep conditioner: mix together and microwave 15-25 seconds or until warm, but not steaming or too hot to touch.</li>
            <li>heats quickly &amp; stays hot when plugged in.</li>

            <li>process with yoyr new heat cap 30-60 minutes then wash out.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, is that your ears will get too hot, I ended up purchasing ear shields/ ear protectors to wear while using the heat cap</li>
            <li>And it arrived early too.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only a little heat even on high and that is the top near the back.</li>
            <li>apply to clean, towel dried hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a plastic shower/processing cap underneath &amp; let your hair cool off before rinsing (heat opens the cuticles to let the conditioner sink in &amp; cooling it will seal it in) &amp; rinse in luke-warm to cold water.  </li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford a steamer get this my dry dull nappy hair is now soft smooth and shiney put your hair in a pony tail and put it in the shower kit so all of your hair to get conditioned</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best steam cap I ever owned...and I owned every brand there is. Fits well and heat is distributed evenly.</li>
            <li> I took out 1 star because it is big for my wife&#x27;s head. However it does the job. it is hot and give a good treatment to the hair, but the key is the product that you will use, if you are not using a good quality treatment, it will not work. get focus on the product that you will use, the effect of the Heat cap is to increase the results like 20% that&#x27;s it. but for the price 20% is a good result</li>
            <li> This was a great buy but the shipping was excessive.  Temp controls are easy to read and work.  No hot spots in the cap.</li>
            <li> This product is well made, and easy to use.  It does get kind of warm, so I plan to use it more on cooler days.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to order this heating cap but it did not heat up in the back of cap to the nap of the hair line.  I returned it and they sent me another one.&lt;br /&gt;Again I could not wait to use it to deep condition my hair, however, this cap also did not heat in the back either...Very dissatisfied receiving not one defective&lt;br /&gt;heating cap but TWO.  Of course I will be returning this one, also, even though there will be a 15% restocking fee.........</li>
            <li> Very easy to read description make this Heat Cap easy to use. You can use it for just about anything. Which I did. Plug it in, choose the setting and heat away!</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t afford a steamer get this my dry dull nappy hair is now soft smooth and shiney put your hair in a pony tail and put it in the shower kit so all of your hair to get conditioned</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and excellent for steaming your hair. Delivered within the given time period. Always wanted one of these.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it once a week for a deep condition.  I does the job and you don&#x27;t have to sit under a noisy hair dryer to deep condition.  The only thing is, is that your ears will get too hot, I ended up purchasing ear shields/ ear protectors to wear while using the heat cap and they work great and are cheap.</li>
            <li> Easier than sitting under a hair dryey</li>
            <li> GIVES A LOT OF HEAT.  MUST PICK HAIR UP TO TOP BECAUSE MACHINE DOESN&#x27;T HEAT AT THE BOTTOM.  MOSTLY HEATS ON TOP.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a month or so but just like the other reviews it only warms at the top and the back of it is a little awkward but it beats going to the salon any day of the week.</li>
            <li> Upside to the electric cord vs battery powered: its always at 100% power. heats quickly &amp; stays hot when plugged in. Downside: short cord &amp; you can&#x27;t move around while using it. So put your cap on &amp; throw on your favorite face mask &amp; relax!  Make sure you use a plastic shower/processing cap underneath &amp; let your hair cool off before rinsing (heat opens the cuticles to let the conditioner sink in &amp; cooling it will seal it in) &amp; rinse in luke-warm to cold water.  Tinks deep conditioner recipe! Two parts real mayonaise, one part of your favorite deep conditioner: mix together and microwave 15-25 seconds or until warm, but not steaming or too hot to touch. this gets rid of the mayo smella! apply to clean, towel dried hair. comb hair to evenly distribute. process with yoyr new heat cap 30-60 minutes then wash out. Repeat once a week or as needed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 4 times and the only time it warmed up enough was when I also put a blanket around my head.  There&#x27;s only a little heat even on high and that is the top near the back.</li>
            <li> Works very well and happy with it. Would recommend to anyone. And it arrived early too.</li>
            <li> I bought this a really long time ago, and it still works great.</li>
