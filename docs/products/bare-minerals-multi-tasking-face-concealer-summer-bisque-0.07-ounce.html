            <li>I love this concealer!</li>
            <li>Gotta love that!</li>
            <li>I have always liked the bisque product.</li>
            <li>The make-up feels weightless, but it provides excellent full-coverage, which is exactly what most are looking for in a make-up.</li>
            <li>Best product compared to bare minerals</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin looking very smooth.</li>
            <li>I love it and love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is so much better than foundation alone.  </li>
            <li>I hope this shade will work ok.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but not the size.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle on my skin and provides great coverage.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and this product blends beautifully with my face.</li>
            <li>It also removes easily.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best concealer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bare Escentuals for an awesome product!  </li>
            <li>It was also delivered quickly!</li>
            <li>This is a light powder and does nothing but enhance the fine lines under your eyes (that you didn&#x27;t even realize were there).  </li>
            <li>It stays smooth all day with no lines or \\&quot;oranginess\\&quot; to it.</li>
            <li>Use this daily, great product.</li>
            <li>The original box was thrown out accidently.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals bisque--this product is good to use over the Amazonian Clay product by Tarte.</li>
            <li>Amazed a powder can cover this good and last all day!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not bad for your skin.</li>
            <li>This is also the best price I have found compared to both online and retail store shopping I have done in the past; plus, it&#x27;s delivered right to your door, so what else could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got nice skin, and I use bare minerals make-up...</li>
            <li>Great coverage and no greasy feel like other concealers!</li>
            <li>It brightens my under eye area, decreases the depth of my smile lines, and makes a couple of blotchy areas disappear before I put my foundation over it.  </li>
            <li>Maybeline makes a liquid all natural mineral concealer that is far superior to this junk.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>beige is just right for me.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Bare Minerals for the way it makes my skin look &amp; feel.</li>
            <li>Love my BARE minerals.</li>
            <li>I love my Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>Clean, light feeling yet truly covers dark spots.</li>
            <li>However I am very reluctant to order makeup on line again.</li>
            <li>It covers very well and doesn&#x27;t wear off at all.</li>
            <li>This Summer Bisque loose powder concealer is lighter easily blends.</li>
            <li>If you need even a decent concealer, go with something else.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals products have never failed me.</li>
            <li>Less work, less cost, FAR better and more natural coverage.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic - a little goes along way, it covers well, and it stays on throughout the day reasonably well.</li>
            <li>The color looks dark in the picture, but I have lighter skin and this still works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Conceals well but looks natural - not heavy make up but does the job!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if I have no makeup on at all; not heavy &amp; a natural look/feel to it.</li>
            <li>It is all so natural.  </li>
            <li>I normally use it for some discoloration left from breakouts and it does what ti should.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For someone who doesn&#x27;t care for the feel of heavy make-up, I was sold on this product from this very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Always reliable product from bare minerals</li>
            <li>I ordered the shade summer bisque Bare Minerals Multi Tasking Face Concealer and received the shade &amp;#34;bisque&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I get all of the effects of the 4-5 step Bare Minerals program with one product.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t purchase Bare Minerals again.</li>
            <li>I normally use BE&#x27;s medium beige loose powder foundation.</li>
            <li>If you have dark circles under your eyes, do yourself a favor and get a real concealer.  </li>
            <li>I only use Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I use this all over my face before putting on my regular Bare Minerals foundation.  </li>
