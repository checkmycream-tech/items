            <li>Love Plant Therapy oils!</li>
            <li>Love this cinnamon oil!</li>
            <li>I keep it in a warm place so that it&#x27;s liquified</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy products are always reasonably priced and are a great value!</li>
            <li>I like to make my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to work on getting more oils and this one smells so good.  </li>
            <li>Warm inviting feeling and smell.</li>
            <li>The person was sooo nice and helpful--another reason I will continue to use their products.</li>
            <li>I wish it would have been easier to see what KIND of Cinnamon because there are some differences.  </li>
            <li>and my daughter was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Very potent, strong scent and taste!</li>
            <li>I was really excited when it arrived and it smelled great out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is VERY strong stuff</li>
            <li>I was able to use it for what I intended on, which was for cooking, better than extract from the grocery store too!</li>
            <li>Immediately put some on a cotton ball in my pantry and look forward to so many more uses!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a nice surprise that the bottle I received was 20% more volume than the size that was listed.</li>
            <li>But beware it burns - never used full strength in skin!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>It was a clean, crisp, delightful smell.</li>
            <li>I mixed about 8 drops within any handy mild/unscented oil and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>(cinnamon oil is very strong), add more oil.</li>
            <li>Great service all-around!</li>
            <li>Great quality and super quick delivery!</li>
            <li>A couple drops in a large cup of coffee is great.</li>
            <li>Most used in aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>this is potent stuff.</li>
            <li>It was an excellent price for an oil that can be used internally.</li>
            <li>Great real Cinnamon flavor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Use it in our homemade toothpaste and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this , I love the way it was packaged.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying dabbing it on my cinnamon tea bags before I brew a pot to enhance the cinnamon flavour.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the holidays, so what can I say, I love burning this stuff in my diffuser.</li>
            <li>what I have read, this oil is an ingredient in the now famous &#x27;Thieves Oil&#x27; blend...</li>
            <li>I ended up wringing my mop about 2 maybe 3 times and cleaning most of my kitchen floor without adding any more vinegar or oil.</li>
            <li>Love the scent in my products.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the order.</li>
            <li>Most useful product that arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Potent oil.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite oils.</li>
            <li>The quality was high and the price was great, as I shopped around before buying.</li>
            <li>If you are going to use this in any mixture, make sure it is properly diluted or put in a good ratio with a good carrier oil.</li>
            <li>very sweet cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li>so I have no way to verify this, but I certainly enjoy the scent and appreciate being able to have an air freshener that does not &#x27;pollute&#x27; my air.</li>
            <li>Fast response, quality product, fair price.</li>
            <li>good quality and fast service.....</li>
            <li>I had to really give my diffuser glass a good cleaning after using it.  </li>
            <li>Try this scent you will love it, a great addition to my variety of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Reasonably strong.</li>
            <li>So far I love the product here and the price was fair.</li>
            <li>The oil is not too strong to take a couple of drops before a meal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a lot of Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil in my diffusers, as autumn has arrived, so I ordered the 1.2oz bottle this time from Plant Therapy as they offer many great essential oils in higher volumes for the best prices.</li>
            <li>that is a huge plus.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This cinnamon essential oil is a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li>To be honest I have not used enough of this product yet to render a full judgement, but it does smell very authentic.</li>
            <li>This has a fantastic aroma through a quality diffuser, but for some reason it tends to clump up and crystalize.  </li>
            <li>I use cinnamon oil in my fragrance free laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>It works great for my intended medicinal uses and I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Out of a large order, this was one of the first items to ship and arrive ahead of time, so good shipping too.</li>
            <li>I can only hope this blend will still be effective in keeping my family healthy this winter.</li>
            <li>I use with in a burner in conjunction with clove and spearmint for an uplifting clean feeling to the air without being antiseptic smelling</li>
            <li>This is a great scent and a quality oil that I expected from a company I trust.</li>
            <li>Not the strongest I&#x27;ve ever tasted, but good enough.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Cinnamon and this captures the essence very well.</li>
            <li>In addition to using it for the obvious baking purposes, it&#x27;s also good for body aches--rub on a couple of drops with a carrier.</li>
            <li>I am using this as much as I can because I just love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>It is sweet and smells sweet.</li>
            <li>This is really too potent for that.  </li>
            <li>Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>highly satisfied and will be coming back for more...</li>
            <li>I actually feel a bit better. :-)</li>
            <li>Regular laundry detergent irritates my skin but the fragrance free one is lacking any nice smell</li>
            <li>Product was packaged well and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I also added it to my Old English furniture polish so now my whole house smells wonderful when I dust!  </li>
            <li>This item came to me FIRST out of a group order!</li>
            <li>I apply this product on my hair because I enjoy the scent of cinnamon so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta order another one as I think one of the last girlfriends stole it as she loved it so much...</li>
            <li>I was brewing cinnamon bark chunks, but this is far better flavor and cost.</li>
            <li>The first half hour it smelled great</li>
            <li>Happy to recommend it to anyone who knows how to use essential oils for healing internally.</li>
            <li>It has a very intense cinnamon aroma and taste.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Even though I am allergic to cinnamon, I love this essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Have been adding about three drops to teapot of hot tea with breakfast</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased any of their oils without immediately ordering a back-up after first use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever had cinnamon toothpicks, this is that exact flavor and heat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for natural beauty products, but am totally comfortable using it for aromatic home use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this seller!</li>
            <li>This is the real thing!</li>
            <li>Make sure you dilute this if using it for any sort of topical application otherwise .... OUCH!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This oil is more potent than I hoped it would be, which is good and bad.  </li>
            <li>My thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised and what we wanted.</li>
            <li>Trying to grow it out as healthy as possible.</li>
            <li>I love this essential oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than having the actual bark of the cinnamon tree.</li>
            <li>It was a pleasant experience rather than my usual, &amp;</li>
            <li>Good for pain and specifically low back pain.</li>
            <li>I love to use this scent in my diffuser, it only takes about 4 drops to really freshen up a room.</li>
            <li>Not a strong odor but a very powerful and potent oil.</li>
            <li>Be conservative at first, as it&#x27;s easy to add too much,  which actually hurt my throat.  </li>
            <li>So we just heat up a little of this oil, and we feel it works alot better than any spray, without the headache the spray gives me!</li>
            <li>Pure cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>, their products seem really pure.</li>
            <li>This cinnamon bark oil is pure cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>Decent oil for the price, smells nice, but it got all crusty under the cap which makes me question the purity compared to some of my other oils.</li>
            <li>Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s also my first essential oil) and will be using vinegar with cinnamon oil from now on to clean my floors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an amazing aroma and so beneficial, I recommend to all as part of your essential oils kit!</li>
            <li>but it was still too much for me.  </li>
            <li>This has the real cinnamon bite I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I like cinnamon anyway, but this is a sharper version that I really like.  </li>
            <li>Really like these oils.</li>
            <li>They hold the scent very well.</li>
            <li>use this so much during the holidays.</li>
            <li>and I think I really like this company</li>
            <li>and I use one drop in the gallon water bottle I have by the bed as it helps control blood sugar levels and my girlfriends like the real cinnamon taste.  </li>
            <li>and you will be very</li>
            <li>This cinnamon bark oil is another fantastic product from Plant Therapy Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>I find that it does fade fast</li>
            <li>I use the H2EO diffuser and really could not be happier.</li>
            <li>It is an intense smell, though.</li>
            <li>and I gotta say it works very well.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than whole foods</li>
            <li>It got here fast just as I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Do not have much to say but will buy again.</li>
            <li>Which will be super beneficial this year, as the flu vaccine apparently doesn&#x27;t work, according to the CDC.</li>
            <li>and if I eventually find the other one, I will just have more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about this essential oil!</li>
            <li>Tried to make my own thieves type oil blend, as the brand of oils I normally use were not available.</li>
            <li>After studying up on insect repellents by using natural oils, I got several different ones and began making my own products.  </li>
            <li>Also, you have to use much more of these essential oils to actually smell them.</li>
            <li>The smell is good, but a bit on the weak side.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The oil seems to be high quality.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>quality, I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Since it is very strong, it takes very little to get the cinnamon flavor.  </li>
            <li>threw a little water on it to add more moisture.</li>
            <li>They diffuse much like some of the higher priced MSM oils, and I&#x27;ve used them topically as well.</li>
            <li>The scent is lively and aromatic and appears to be high-quality.</li>
            <li>I live with someone who has had weight loss surgery, and wooooooo...</li>
            <li>The Shea butter does leave your lips very soft.  </li>
            <li>I use conventional shampoo very rarely.</li>
            <li>This is what I wanted, I m new to the whole essential oils world</li>
            <li>Some other brands of essential oils I have tried have a strong oily scent that dominates, but this product does not.</li>
            <li>and it helps clear my head and throat.  </li>
            <li>put in old wax to liven up the scent.</li>
            <li>They say it is a natural immune system booster, natural antiviral fungal remedy that also combats bacterial infections, I am not a scientist</li>
            <li>and even he said it smelled like really old pee.</li>
            <li>Be sure to only use a few drops...</li>
            <li>wow be careful, this is strong, one drop diluted goes a long way</li>
            <li>Use this for many things and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The scent really lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I was trying to save money by not going with the more expensive essential oils and I highly regret it.</li>
            <li>Future purchase anticipated in the near future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few cinnamon bark oils I do like this one for the price.wonderful aroma and hot toothpicks.</li>
            <li>The Cinnamon bark essential oil came on time but at this time I am unable to give a honest review since I have not use the product long enough to see if it works the way I want it to.</li>

            <li> The cinnamon smell wasn&#x27;t that pleasant smell we all know around Christmas time.</li>
            <li> I seem to be always buying from Plant Therapy-their oils are very good, affordable and have the fragrance label on the top</li>
            <li> Received in good time and will order this brand again.</li>
            <li> a good sized bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This did not come out smelling good or anything like what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> REALLY good product.</li>
            <li> I does a good job if you are using it to flavor toothpicks.  </li>
            <li> Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar.</li>

            <li> Boy is this oil very potent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of cinnamon!  </li>
            <li> I put 8 drops in a medium load of laundry and it was about 5 too many!</li>
            <li> I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Love Plant Therapy oils!</li>
            <li> Love this cinnamon oil!</li>
            <li> I keep it in a warm place so that it&#x27;s liquified</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy products are always reasonably priced and are a great value!</li>
            <li> I like to make my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to work on getting more oils and this one smells so good.  </li>
            <li> Warm inviting feeling and smell.</li>
            <li> The person was sooo nice and helpful--another reason I will continue to use their products.</li>
            <li> I wish it would have been easier to see what KIND of Cinnamon because there are some differences.  </li>
            <li> and my daughter was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Very potent, strong scent and taste!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when it arrived and it smelled great out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is VERY strong stuff</li>
            <li> I was able to use it for what I intended on, which was for cooking, better than extract from the grocery store too!</li>
            <li> Immediately put some on a cotton ball in my pantry and look forward to so many more uses!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a nice surprise that the bottle I received was 20% more volume than the size that was listed.</li>
            <li> But beware it burns - never used full strength in skin!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> It was a clean, crisp, delightful smell.</li>
            <li> I mixed about 8 drops within any handy mild/unscented oil and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> (cinnamon oil is very strong), add more oil.</li>
            <li> Great service all-around!</li>
            <li> Great quality and super quick delivery!</li>
            <li> A couple drops in a large cup of coffee is great.</li>
            <li> Most used in aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> this is potent stuff.</li>
            <li> It was an excellent price for an oil that can be used internally.</li>
            <li> Great real Cinnamon flavor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Use it in our homemade toothpaste and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this , I love the way it was packaged.  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying dabbing it on my cinnamon tea bags before I brew a pot to enhance the cinnamon flavour.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the holidays, so what can I say, I love burning this stuff in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> what I have read, this oil is an ingredient in the now famous &#x27;Thieves Oil&#x27; blend...</li>
            <li> I ended up wringing my mop about 2 maybe 3 times and cleaning most of my kitchen floor without adding any more vinegar or oil.</li>
            <li> Love the scent in my products.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the order.</li>
            <li> Most useful product that arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Potent oil.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oils.</li>
            <li> The quality was high and the price was great, as I shopped around before buying.</li>
            <li> If you are going to use this in any mixture, make sure it is properly diluted or put in a good ratio with a good carrier oil.</li>
            <li> very sweet cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li> so I have no way to verify this, but I certainly enjoy the scent and appreciate being able to have an air freshener that does not &#x27;pollute&#x27; my air.</li>
            <li> Fast response, quality product, fair price.</li>
            <li> good quality and fast service.....</li>
            <li> I had to really give my diffuser glass a good cleaning after using it.  </li>
            <li> Try this scent you will love it, a great addition to my variety of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Reasonably strong.</li>
            <li> So far I love the product here and the price was fair.</li>
            <li> The oil is not too strong to take a couple of drops before a meal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a lot of Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil in my diffusers, as autumn has arrived, so I ordered the 1.2oz bottle this time from Plant Therapy as they offer many great essential oils in higher volumes for the best prices.</li>
            <li> that is a huge plus.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This cinnamon essential oil is a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> To be honest I have not used enough of this product yet to render a full judgement, but it does smell very authentic.</li>
            <li> This has a fantastic aroma through a quality diffuser, but for some reason it tends to clump up and crystalize.  </li>
            <li> I use cinnamon oil in my fragrance free laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> It works great for my intended medicinal uses and I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Out of a large order, this was one of the first items to ship and arrive ahead of time, so good shipping too.</li>
            <li> I can only hope this blend will still be effective in keeping my family healthy this winter.</li>
            <li> I use with in a burner in conjunction with clove and spearmint for an uplifting clean feeling to the air without being antiseptic smelling</li>
            <li> This is a great scent and a quality oil that I expected from a company I trust.</li>
            <li> Not the strongest I&#x27;ve ever tasted, but good enough.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Cinnamon and this captures the essence very well.</li>
            <li> In addition to using it for the obvious baking purposes, it&#x27;s also good for body aches--rub on a couple of drops with a carrier.</li>
            <li> I am using this as much as I can because I just love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> It is sweet and smells sweet.</li>
            <li> This is really too potent for that.  </li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> highly satisfied and will be coming back for more...</li>
            <li> I actually feel a bit better. :-)</li>
            <li> Regular laundry detergent irritates my skin but the fragrance free one is lacking any nice smell</li>
            <li> Product was packaged well and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I also added it to my Old English furniture polish so now my whole house smells wonderful when I dust!  </li>
            <li> This item came to me FIRST out of a group order!</li>
            <li> I apply this product on my hair because I enjoy the scent of cinnamon so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta order another one as I think one of the last girlfriends stole it as she loved it so much...</li>
            <li> I was brewing cinnamon bark chunks, but this is far better flavor and cost.</li>
            <li> The first half hour it smelled great</li>
            <li> Happy to recommend it to anyone who knows how to use essential oils for healing internally.</li>
            <li> It has a very intense cinnamon aroma and taste.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> Even though I am allergic to cinnamon, I love this essential oil.  </li>
            <li> Have been adding about three drops to teapot of hot tea with breakfast</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased any of their oils without immediately ordering a back-up after first use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had cinnamon toothpicks, this is that exact flavor and heat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for natural beauty products, but am totally comfortable using it for aromatic home use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> This is the real thing!</li>
            <li> Make sure you dilute this if using it for any sort of topical application otherwise .... OUCH!  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This oil is more potent than I hoped it would be, which is good and bad.  </li>
            <li> My thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and what we wanted.</li>
            <li> Trying to grow it out as healthy as possible.</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than having the actual bark of the cinnamon tree.</li>
            <li> It was a pleasant experience rather than my usual, &amp;</li>
            <li> Good for pain and specifically low back pain.</li>
            <li> I love to use this scent in my diffuser, it only takes about 4 drops to really freshen up a room.</li>
            <li> Not a strong odor but a very powerful and potent oil.</li>
            <li> Be conservative at first, as it&#x27;s easy to add too much,  which actually hurt my throat.  </li>
            <li> So we just heat up a little of this oil, and we feel it works alot better than any spray, without the headache the spray gives me!</li>
            <li> Pure cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li> , their products seem really pure.</li>
            <li> This cinnamon bark oil is pure cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li> Decent oil for the price, smells nice, but it got all crusty under the cap which makes me question the purity compared to some of my other oils.</li>
            <li> Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s also my first essential oil) and will be using vinegar with cinnamon oil from now on to clean my floors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an amazing aroma and so beneficial, I recommend to all as part of your essential oils kit!</li>
            <li> but it was still too much for me.  </li>
            <li> This has the real cinnamon bite I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I like cinnamon anyway, but this is a sharper version that I really like.  </li>
            <li> Really like these oils.</li>
            <li> They hold the scent very well.</li>
            <li> use this so much during the holidays.</li>
            <li> and I think I really like this company</li>
            <li> and I use one drop in the gallon water bottle I have by the bed as it helps control blood sugar levels and my girlfriends like the real cinnamon taste.  </li>
            <li> and you will be very</li>
            <li> This cinnamon bark oil is another fantastic product from Plant Therapy Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> I find that it does fade fast</li>
            <li> I use the H2EO diffuser and really could not be happier.</li>
            <li> It is an intense smell, though.</li>
            <li> and I gotta say it works very well.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than whole foods</li>
            <li> It got here fast just as I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Do not have much to say but will buy again.</li>
            <li> Which will be super beneficial this year, as the flu vaccine apparently doesn&#x27;t work, according to the CDC.</li>
            <li> and if I eventually find the other one, I will just have more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about this essential oil!</li>
            <li> Tried to make my own thieves type oil blend, as the brand of oils I normally use were not available.</li>
            <li> After studying up on insect repellents by using natural oils, I got several different ones and began making my own products.  </li>
            <li> Also, you have to use much more of these essential oils to actually smell them.</li>
            <li> The smell is good, but a bit on the weak side.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The oil seems to be high quality.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> quality, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Since it is very strong, it takes very little to get the cinnamon flavor.  </li>
            <li> threw a little water on it to add more moisture.</li>
            <li> They diffuse much like some of the higher priced MSM oils, and I&#x27;ve used them topically as well.</li>
            <li> The scent is lively and aromatic and appears to be high-quality.</li>
            <li> I live with someone who has had weight loss surgery, and wooooooo...</li>
            <li> The Shea butter does leave your lips very soft.  </li>
            <li> I use conventional shampoo very rarely.</li>
            <li> This is what I wanted, I m new to the whole essential oils world</li>
            <li> Some other brands of essential oils I have tried have a strong oily scent that dominates, but this product does not.</li>
            <li> and it helps clear my head and throat.  </li>
            <li> put in old wax to liven up the scent.</li>
            <li> They say it is a natural immune system booster, natural antiviral fungal remedy that also combats bacterial infections, I am not a scientist</li>
            <li> and even he said it smelled like really old pee.</li>
            <li> Be sure to only use a few drops...</li>
            <li> wow be careful, this is strong, one drop diluted goes a long way</li>
            <li> Use this for many things and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The scent really lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to save money by not going with the more expensive essential oils and I highly regret it.</li>
            <li> Future purchase anticipated in the near future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few cinnamon bark oils I do like this one for the price.wonderful aroma and hot toothpicks.</li>
            <li> The Cinnamon bark essential oil came on time but at this time I am unable to give a honest review since I have not use the product long enough to see if it works the way I want it to.</li>
            <li> I have applied drops of the essential oil to the broom branches at least five times, but the aroma just doesn&#x27;t last unless you&#x27;re right next to them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this essential oil thinking the scent would last in the air for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It has a sweet scent to it similar to a cinnamon candy like cinnamon bears or those small red round candies.</li>
            <li> I melted down an old cinnamon candle, and add this to the tart melter I have to re-heat the wax.  </li>
            <li> This will make the aroma of the wax last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it directly and undiluted on the skin as it will turn skin red and slightly burn.</li>
            <li> I have used both Young Living and DoTerra in the past and will be switching back.</li>
            <li> I use this as a car air freshener by putting several drops on a cotton ball and slipping it into the side of the air vents.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to get either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sensitive to vinegar (but my bf is!)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really put my finger on what it smelled like, but a coat that I hung dried smelled up a room for a couple days but went away after a few days.</li>
            <li> Just remember to use distilled water or equivalent and that this bark does give off a slight stain to white material.</li>
            <li> Almost peppery.  </li>
            <li> Everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> After starting with just a few drops in about a tablespoon of butter, I have worked my way up to about 15-16 drops.  </li>
            <li> so be careful how you use it.</li>
            <li> Wet my mop and started mopping.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you use this oil.</li>
            <li> A little lasts a while and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Well packaged in dark glass, smells as expected.</li>
            <li> Dip the other end in oil and treat the other nostril.</li>
            <li> I use so many of their oils and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> while cleaning my nose got extremely runny</li>
            <li> #34;I&#x27;m gonna pass out, open a window.&amp;#34; with my usual chemical floor cleaner.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the pricier cinnamon bark essential oils I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> my numerous cinnamon brooms that I have purchased for the holidays in past years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;only used it once with a quarter teaspoon into rubbing alcohol mixed for a spray to try as a homemade mite repellent on cloth-covered items.&lt;br /&gt;it did have a very strong smell as expected for a few days.</li>
            <li> Usually, I use castile soap to wash my hair, air dry, and then I use a 1/2 teaspoon of organic coconut oil once or twice a week for conditioning, staying away from my scalp.</li>
            <li> It was a total failure.</li>
            <li> Today I used it to mop by my garbage and where I made a mess by my stove.</li>
            <li> I use a little on my scalp with a q-tip after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried using a few drops in my bath wash</li>
            <li> Mix a few drops with water and use as a mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> I also mix a few drops with cinnamon/spice potpourri to revitalize the smell.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid (45 years ago) I would go to the pharmacy and get a few drops of cinnamon oil</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend you try this oil, you will not be disappointed in the quality, and price for a 1oz bottle will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> However, I put a few drops around my house and in my car.</li>
            <li> I ran out of pinesol so dropped a few dashes of vinegar in those two spots.</li>
            <li> My hair feels a bit thicker around my hair line after a few months use.  </li>
            <li> I rub it on all my window sills and thresholds and it really keeps ants and creepy crawlies at bay!  </li>
            <li> ( I found out very quickly to NOT lick my lips when I have it on &#x27;)</li>
            <li> I use a small makeup brush to put it on with, It does burn the fingers and then any other body part you might touch!!  </li>
            <li> small price to pay</li>
            <li> Not sure I like it for either use.</li>
            <li> I have past my shoulders wavy brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have gotten another brand that was very thick and dark and did not diffuse well.  </li>
            <li> Not great for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I just mixed some with tea tree, oregano oil, and water, to use a mold repellent on my windowsills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil left a horrible smell that lingered for days.</li>
            <li> (sorry if that&#x27;s TMI) to get everything out.</li>
            <li> I use in combination with coconut oil on the bottom of my daughters feet to prevent them from getting sick during the cold season.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> I mix this with the coconut oil base and go crazy.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t even notice the vinegar which is very unlikely for him!</li>
            <li> so I knew the awful smell.was coming from the cinnamon oil.</li>
            <li> Horrible stink.</li>
            <li> But this stuff is just horrible.</li>
            <li> Awful stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Even though I am allergic to cinnamon, I love this essential oil.  I tried using a few drops in my bath wash but it was still too much for me.  My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Pure cinnamon flavor. This has the real cinnamon bite I was looking for. A couple drops in a large cup of coffee is great.</li>
            <li> I love the use&#x27;s for this excellent quality oil as ant&#x27;s don&#x27;t care for cinnamon and that is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;  Received in good time and will order this brand again.</li>
            <li> Well packaged in dark glass, smells as expected. Mix a few drops with water and use as a mouthwash.  Most used in aromatherapy. I also mix a few drops with cinnamon/spice potpourri to revitalize the smell.</li>
            <li> Have been adding about three drops to teapot of hot tea with breakfast and it helps clear my head and throat.  I like cinnamon anyway, but this is a sharper version that I really like.  Almost peppery.  Be conservative at first, as it&#x27;s easy to add too much,  which actually hurt my throat.  I will continue buying this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few cinnamon bark oils I do like this one for the price.wonderful aroma and hot toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Decent oil for the price, smells nice, but it got all crusty under the cap which makes me question the purity compared to some of my other oils.</li>
            <li> I used this oil to make homemade toothpaste.  Smells and tastes great!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this. We use it in lip balm and diffuse it. Shipping was great.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid (45 years ago) I would go to the pharmacy and get a few drops of cinnamon oil so I could make cinnamon toothpicks.  This oil works perfectly, all you need are the toothpicks and a bottle.  Be sure to only use a few drops... this is potent stuff.</li>
            <li> This is what I wanted, I m new to the whole essential oils world so I am apprehensive about five stars just yet....</li>
            <li> Really like these oils. They hold the scent very well.</li>
            <li> use this so much during the holidays. put in old wax to liven up the scent. very sweet cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent and a quality oil that I expected from a company I trust. Try this scent you will love it, a great addition to my variety of essential oils. Good for pain and specifically low back pain. I definitely recommend you try this oil, you will not be disappointed in the quality, and price for a 1oz bottle will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews for this &amp; thought it would have a great scent. I was really excited when it arrived and it smelled great out of the bottle. However, I put a few drops around my house and in my car. The first half hour it smelled great but then the after-scent came. This oil left a horrible smell that lingered for days. I will only be ordering cinnamon LEAF oil from now on!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.  Fast response, quality product, fair price.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of cinnamon!  I melted down an old cinnamon candle, and add this to the tart melter I have to re-heat the wax.  This will make the aroma of the wax last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This adds a wonderful smell to any of the oils I use in my house or give as a gift.</li>
            <li> This oil is doing the job I bought it for commendably. It was an excellent price for an oil that can be used internally. They shipped quickly and everything about this experience is perfectly wonderful. Happy to recommend it to anyone who knows how to use essential oils for healing internally.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and I think I really like this company, their products seem really pure.</li>
            <li> Great quality with a wonderful strong cinnamon smell.</li>
            <li> a good sized bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only used it once with a quarter teaspoon into rubbing alcohol mixed for a spray to try as a homemade mite repellent on cloth-covered items.&lt;br /&gt;it did have a very strong smell as expected for a few days.</li>
            <li> Great product. Reasonably strong. Not the strongest I&#x27;ve ever tasted, but good enough.</li>
            <li> Great real Cinnamon flavor and I use one drop in the gallon water bottle I have by the bed as it helps control blood sugar levels and my girlfriends like the real cinnamon taste.  Just get a bottle and you will be very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta order another one as I think one of the last girlfriends stole it as she loved it so much...small price to pay and if I eventually find the other one, I will just have more.  Seems to last at lest a year with no denigration.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in my Shea butter to make a lip plumber.  After starting with just a few drops in about a tablespoon of butter, I have worked my way up to about 15-16 drops.  I will say that it doesn&#x27;t taste very good, ( I found out very quickly to NOT lick my lips when I have it on &#x27;) but it does the trick!  The Shea butter does leave your lips very soft.  I use a small makeup brush to put it on with, It does burn the fingers and then any other body part you might touch!!  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with some coconut oil and now use it every night to help keep my chronic nasal inflammation under control. It&#x27;s working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. And I&#x27;ve been dealing with this for 25 years! I mixed something like 2-4 drops in a couple tablespoons of oil. I keep it in a warm place so that it&#x27;s liquified, I dip a Q-tip in it (saturate it) and swab way inside my nostril. Dip the other end in oil and treat the other nostril. If you try this and it&#x27;s too burny (cinnamon oil is very strong), add more oil.</li>
            <li> This cinnamon bark oil is another fantastic product from Plant Therapy Essential Oils. I use so many of their oils and have not been disappointed. Although it has many uses, I&#x27;m amazed at how this gets rid of ant infestations!!! Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased any of their oils without immediately ordering a back-up after first use. Lemon is next on my list...</li>
            <li> This cinnamon essential oil is a great deal for the price. You get a good quantity and it is also great quality. I love to use this scent in my diffuser, it only takes about 4 drops to really freshen up a room. They say it is a natural immune system booster, natural antiviral fungal remedy that also combats bacterial infections, I am not a scientist so I have no way to verify this, but I certainly enjoy the scent and appreciate being able to have an air freshener that does not &#x27;pollute&#x27; my air.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  A. Great. Idea. But  one  that  doesn&#x27;t work.  I wanted to revive my scented pine cones. It was a total failure.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was trying to save money by not going with the more expensive essential oils and I highly regret it. I purchased three bottles of different scents from Plant Therapy Essentials Oils and they smell nothing like what they are labeled. I have used both Young Living and DoTerra in the past and will be switching back. Also, you have to use much more of these essential oils to actually smell them. I have requested a refund/credit, but if that doesn&#x27;t happen I will be throwing these oils out.</li>
            <li> This cinnamon bark oil is pure cinnamon flavor. If you&#x27;ve ever had cinnamon toothpicks, this is that exact flavor and heat. I add it to my coffee (one drop) and ice tea 16oz (two drops). I was brewing cinnamon bark chunks, but this is far better flavor and cost. I highly recommend this product. I bought the smaller size just to try, but there is a larger size also.</li>
            <li> This is VERY strong stuff so be careful how you use it. I tried it as oral drops and dermal oil on feet. Not sure I like it for either use.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Cinnamon and this captures the essence very well. I mix this with the coconut oil base and go crazy.</li>
            <li> I find that Plant Therapy oils are great quality for the price paid. They diffuse much like some of the higher priced MSM oils, and I&#x27;ve used them topically as well. (I&#x27;ve never taken oils internally.)</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly in good condition.  The oil seems to be high quality.  It made a great addition to the healing balm I made.</li>
            <li> This is a great cinnamon bark.  I have gotten another brand that was very thick and dark and did not diffuse well.  This one has a good flavor and scent.</li>
            <li> It smells so good. also I read that this oil if mixed with denatured alcohol and water will kill dust mites. I spray it on my mattress and on pillows and covers. everything smells so good.</li>
            <li> Smells good. I find that it does fade fast</li>
            <li> Use it in our homemade toothpaste and love it.</li>
            <li> So far I love the product here and the price was fair. I use the H2EO diffuser and really could not be happier. Just remember to use distilled water or equivalent and that this bark does give off a slight stain to white material. Both not a big deal for me. The scent is lively and aromatic and appears to be high-quality.</li>
            <li> I use this as a car air freshener by putting several drops on a cotton ball and slipping it into the side of the air vents.  Trying it on the areas in shower that tend to get mold.  This not being organic I don&#x27;t use it for natural beauty products, but am totally comfortable using it for aromatic home use.&lt;br /&gt;It was a nice surprise that the bottle I received was 20% more volume than the size that was listed. 1.21 fl. oz. vs. 1 fl. oz.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil. In addition to using it for the obvious baking purposes, it&#x27;s also good for body aches--rub on a couple of drops with a carrier. Plant Therapy products are always reasonably priced and are a great value!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent oil.... But beware it burns - never used full strength in skin!!</li>
            <li> I love this , I love the way it was packaged.  I am using this as much as I can because I just love the smell of it.  I am enjoying dabbing it on my cinnamon tea bags before I brew a pot to enhance the cinnamon flavour.  Just divine.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is sweet and smells sweet. Not great for cleaning.</li>
            <li> After studying up on insect repellents by using natural oils, I got several different ones and began making my own products.  I use this Cinnamon Bark EVERYWHERE!  I rub it on all my window sills and thresholds and it really keeps ants and creepy crawlies at bay!  I also added it to my Old English furniture polish so now my whole house smells wonderful when I dust!  The scent really lasts a long time.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the holidays, so what can I say, I love burning this stuff in my diffuser. It makes it feel so homey. It is an intense smell, though. I just mixed some with tea tree, oregano oil, and water, to use a mold repellent on my windowsills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I have read, this oil is an ingredient in the now famous &#x27;Thieves Oil&#x27; blend... I like to make my own. I have also read that Cinnamon Essential Oil, when diffused through the air, kills bacteria and viruses it encounters. Which will be super beneficial this year, as the flu vaccine apparently doesn&#x27;t work, according to the CDC.</li>
            <li> great for cinnamon toothpicks</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times and only for cleaning. I put 8 drops in a medium load of laundry and it was about 5 too many! The cinnamon smell wasn&#x27;t that pleasant smell we all know around Christmas time. I can&#x27;t really put my finger on what it smelled like, but a coat that I hung dried smelled up a room for a couple days but went away after a few days. Today I used it to mop by my garbage and where I made a mess by my stove. I ran out of pinesol so dropped a few dashes of vinegar in those two spots. Then added about 4 dropped of cinnamon oil by my stove and about 6 by my garbage can. threw a little water on it to add more moisture. Wet my mop and started mopping. I&#x27;m not sensitive to vinegar (but my bf is!) so I knew the awful smell.was coming from the cinnamon oil. I ended up wringing my mop about 2 maybe 3 times and cleaning most of my kitchen floor without adding any more vinegar or oil. while cleaning my nose got extremely runny and I started smelling the traditiomal cinnamon smell. It was clearing my sinuses and my bf walked in and said it smelled really good. He didn&#x27;t even notice the vinegar which is very unlikely for him! I had to blow my nose 4 times (sorry if that&#x27;s TMI) to get everything out. It was enough to convince me this stuff works, (It&#x27;s also my first essential oil) and will be using vinegar with cinnamon oil from now on to clean my floors. It was a pleasant experience rather than my usual, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m gonna pass out, open a window.&amp;#34; with my usual chemical floor cleaner. The cinnamon smell stood around for about 4 hours. It was a clean, crisp, delightful smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! I apply this product on my hair because I enjoy the scent of cinnamon so much. I also use this as a lip plumper and I gotta say it works very well.</li>
            <li> Tried to make my own thieves type oil blend, as the brand of oils I normally use were not available. This did not come out smelling good or anything like what I&#x27;m used to. I can only hope this blend will still be effective in keeping my family healthy this winter.</li>
            <li> I bought it to drown out the smell of dog in my house. Does the trick. Only wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to work on getting more oils and this one smells so good.  It didn&#x27;t take long to get either.</li>
            <li> Always a pleasures! Great quality and super quick delivery!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing in my diffuser!  I add a couple drops and a couple drops of orange or tangerine.  My house smells wonderful! Great price too.</li>
            <li> I use with in a burner in conjunction with clove and spearmint for an uplifting clean feeling to the air without being antiseptic smelling</li>
            <li> Horrible stink. Nothing like the pricier cinnamon bark essential oils I&#x27;ve bought in the past. Smelled just like cat pee to me. I use cinnamon bark in soap and on toothpicks. But this stuff is just horrible. I made my husband smell it and even he said it smelled like really old pee. Prime example of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;! So disappointed..... Awful stuff.</li>
            <li> Very potent, strong scent and taste! I was able to use it for what I intended on, which was for cooking, better than extract from the grocery store too!</li>
            <li> Love the scent in my products.</li>
            <li> Warm inviting feeling and smell. Has worked perfectly .</li>
            <li> I seem to be always buying from Plant Therapy-their oils are very good, affordable and have the fragrance label on the top so I can see immediately see which one I will select. I just had to call them today to see how to make this&amp;#34; Cinnamon&amp;#34; flow easier from the bottle. The person was sooo nice and helpful--another reason I will continue to use their products. I most definitely recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I wish it would have been easier to see what KIND of Cinnamon because there are some differences.  I was satisfied with the order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a lot of Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil in my diffusers, as autumn has arrived, so I ordered the 1.2oz bottle this time from Plant Therapy as they offer many great essential oils in higher volumes for the best prices.</li>
            <li> To be honest I have not used enough of this product yet to render a full judgement, but it does smell very authentic. Some other brands of essential oils I have tried have a strong oily scent that dominates, but this product does not. It has a very intense cinnamon aroma and taste. This is the real thing! Out of a large order, this was one of the first items to ship and arrive ahead of time, so good shipping too. Great service all-around!</li>
            <li> Make sure you dilute this if using it for any sort of topical application otherwise .... OUCH!  I mixed about 8 drops within any handy mild/unscented oil and it was perfect. A little lasts a while and goes a long way. REALLY good product.</li>
            <li> Great oil, quality was very good and of course the smell is heavenly. Great prices doesn&#x27;t hurt either. Will buy this product again soon</li>
            <li> The quality is the best I have every purchased today!  It works great and taste wonderful in my homemade toothpaste. Great investment.  Future purchase anticipated in the near future.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than whole foods&lt;br /&gt;I also tested it against that brand and it was &amp;#34;purer&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;high quality, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Love Plant Therapy oils! Great oils at great prices!</li>
            <li> The smell is good, but a bit on the weak side.  Was looking for something stronger.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! Fast shipping! Bottles protected by bubble wrap and were sealed. My house is smelling great!</li>
            <li> great bang for the buck....good quality and fast service.....highly satisfied and will be coming back for more...thank you very much</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff, use one drop in shake. I actually feel a bit better. :-)</li>
            <li> Works well for my purposes</li>
            <li> I bought this essential oil thinking the scent would last in the air for a long time.  I bought it specifically for &amp;#34;reviving&amp;#34; my numerous cinnamon brooms that I have purchased for the holidays in past years.  I have applied drops of the essential oil to the broom branches at least five times, but the aroma just doesn&#x27;t last unless you&#x27;re right next to them.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> This oil is more potent than I hoped it would be, which is good and bad.  Since it is very strong, it takes very little to get the cinnamon flavor.  However, I was hoping to find one I could use to put a drop on my tongue.  This is really too potent for that.  I does a good job if you are using it to flavor toothpicks.  It also only takes one drop to add flavor to drinks, etc.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price. I am very satisfied. My thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I use in combination with coconut oil on the bottom of my daughters feet to prevent them from getting sick during the cold season.  Works great and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and what we wanted. This item is just as pictured. Most useful product that arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> This has a fantastic aroma through a quality diffuser, but for some reason it tends to clump up and crystalize.  I haven&#x27;t experience this problem before with an aromatherapy oil.  I had to really give my diffuser glass a good cleaning after using it.  If you keep up with cleaning your diffuser, this is great.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about this product. The Cinnamon bark essential oil came on time but at this time I am unable to give a honest review since I have not use the product long enough to see if it works the way I want it to.</li>
            <li> I live with someone who has had weight loss surgery, and wooooooo...it gets stinky in our bathroom sometimes! So we just heat up a little of this oil, and we feel it works alot better than any spray, without the headache the spray gives me! It lasts longer too.</li>
            <li> This cinnamon smells so good! It has a sweet scent to it similar to a cinnamon candy like cinnamon bears or those small red round candies. Seller did OUTSTANDING work shipping as well!!! This item came to me FIRST out of a group order!</li>
            <li> I use a little on my scalp with a q-tip after washing my hair. Which is twice to three times a week. My hair feels a bit thicker around my hair line after a few months use.  I use conventional shampoo very rarely. Usually, I use castile soap to wash my hair, air dry, and then I use a 1/2 teaspoon of organic coconut oil once or twice a week for conditioning, staying away from my scalp. I have past my shoulders wavy brown hair. Trying to grow it out as healthy as possible. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li> Love this cinnamon oil! It got here fast just as I wanted it to. I use cinnamon oil in my fragrance free laundry detergent. Regular laundry detergent irritates my skin but the fragrance free one is lacking any nice smell (I know that&#x27;s the point lol) The cinnamon allows me to have smell without irritation. It also lasts longer than lavender</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil.  Great size at a good price.  The shipping was fast.  I use this oil for making toothpaste.  This is the only oil my husband lets me use for the toothpaste.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great value! Product was packaged well and delivered quickly. I bought it to use in a fragrance diffuser and for some craft projects.</li>
            <li> Plan to make Chai Tea lip balm, will smell divine as that oil smell really good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about this essential oil! Love the wonderful cinnamon aroma! Immediately put some on a cotton ball in my pantry and look forward to so many more uses!</li>
            <li> the key to weight loss is regulating sugar and this is a convenient and practical way to do so. The oil is not too strong to take a couple of drops before a meal. The price is great! I would like to get this one on automatic refill thru Amazon!</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of this oil. It works great for my intended medicinal uses and I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. Smells great! I used in some pumpkin spice soap and it turned out wonderful and smelled so yummy!</li>
            <li> wow be careful, this is strong, one drop diluted goes a long way</li>
            <li> Potent oil. Love it. Will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you use this oil. Boy is this oil very potent. This is the real deal. Use this for many things and a little goes a long way. Do not have much to say but will buy again. If you are going to use this in any mixture, make sure it is properly diluted or put in a good ratio with a good carrier oil.</li>
            <li> As always PT smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My daughter wanted to make cinnamon toothpicks so I ordered this.  Toothpicks came out very good and my daughter was thrilled.  Will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Not a strong odor but a very powerful and potent oil. I used it in my homemade chapstick and it definately tingles and plumps the lips! Be careful not to get it directly and undiluted on the skin as it will turn skin red and slightly burn.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oils. The quality was high and the price was great, as I shopped around before buying. It&#x27;s such an amazing aroma and so beneficial, I recommend to all as part of your essential oils kit!</li>
            <li> This is the best cinnamon oil I have ever smelled. It&#x27;s better than having the actual bark of the cinnamon tree.</li>
