            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I took the chance and bought it.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for many years.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely floral scent, however, it lasts about 15 minutes, no staying power</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of lily-of-the-valley.</li>
            <li>This perfume does not smell like the Lily of the Valley that I know and love.</li>
            <li>More like... stinkweed.</li>
            <li>It is rather strong</li>
            <li>I even went retro and sprayed it on my light bulb so that in the evening, when I turned on the lamp, the fragrance wafted its way through the room.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes a great gift or personal item.</li>
            <li>Yes I do like the light scent</li>
            <li>but still a fantastic</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update to my original</li>
            <li>It smells like walking through a flower garden in full bloom.</li>
            <li>This might not be as sweet and flowery as you would think you were going to get from something called lily of the valley</li>
            <li>not as sweet as i would like it</li>
            <li>Very pretty floral scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely strong and very musky smelling instead.</li>
            <li>This has a pleasant enough scent, but doesn&#x27;t smell anything like real Lily of the Valley.  </li>
            <li>but the smell is not quite what I expected, however if you love Lily of the Valley as I do, the convenience of being able to carry with you in purse of pocket gives it a thumbs up for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a fresh scent of &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34; at all, it doesn&#x27;t have any flowerly scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t remind me of fresh lily of the valley at all.</li>
            <li>For the price it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I liked it however did not have the same fragrance,that Lilly of The Valley should of had</li>
            <li>but it has such a beautiful scent I had to buy a few more</li>
            <li>but right on the money when it comes to smelling like Lily of the Valley.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am satisfied: it&#x27;s not cheap alcohol based perfume, it&#x27;s actually an oil, it smells so wonderfully and reminds me my mom&#x27;s favorite lily of the valley perfume.</li>
            <li>wore Lily of the Valley scent the day I married my husband 29 years ago</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never smelled lilly of the valley perfume before, at least i dont think i have anyway lol.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as I remember it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife and I both love the scent the only problem was the product leaked in the envelope.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK overall.</li>
            <li>It really smells like the perfume my Mother used to wear !  </li>
            <li>so I would be sure to have some back up bottles.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted and arrived in time to be a holiday gift.</li>
            <li>when applied,very sticky&#x27;smelled more like a strange oil...will not buy again.thank you</li>
            <li>We have large beds of the plant in our flower garden.</li>
            <li>I CANT TELL YOU HOW MUCH</li>
            <li>I REALLY DO LIKE IT&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really didnt known what to expect when i ordered this.</li>
            <li>My friends really want to know my fragrance......</li>
            <li>This supposed to be &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34; oil, has nothing to do with real smell of &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really dind&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>I was very leery buying this after reading the reviews from people saying it didnt smell like Lily of the Valley.</li>
            <li>I expected more lily of the valley fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>Lovely, clean, long lasting fresh scent  Brings back memories of my childhood.  </li>
            <li>Needs more lily of the valley and less cowbell.</li>
            <li>The first gift my brother gave me was this cologne, and it has remained a sentimental favorite.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances, don&#x27;t buy this !!</li>
            <li>Forget about the bottle seller advertized, it&#x27;s not a round one, which I have received it.&lt;br /&gt;I believe, that this Seller purposely mislead and tricked buyers to spend money on something far away from real product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Memories came flooding back with the first spray.  </li>
            <li>Very strong and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>After some time it COMPLETELY disappeared leaving me with just unscented oil.</li>
            <li>This don&#x27;t last for more than a few minutes.....</li>

            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t find the scent very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> And the fragrance lingers a long time.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;signature scent!&amp;#34; Will continue to use this for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> Oil makes a better base than alchohol because it doesn&#x27;t add that conflicting and generic scent.</li>
            <li> Lily of the valley scent is a very difficult one to get right as I&#x27;ve noticed from trying several brands.  </li>
            <li> The applicator is small enough to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mixture of other scents.</li>
            <li> I just did not like the smell of lily of the valley women perfume body oil,, its did not smell like this other I got</li>
            <li> review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was extremely subtle, barely there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine scent,however I was disappointed that the glass bottle didn&#x27;t look like the picture: no curved glass, it&#x27;s just plain glass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it in the past and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I developed a bad allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> For the low cost, don&#x27;t be afraid to try it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say not good</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it around for decades, at least not in my town, so when I did a search on lily of the valley and this cologne came up in the search - heck, yes!</li>
            <li> so It was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was not happy at all</li>
            <li> Stale, old smelling, awful.</li>
            <li> I exclusively use Lily of the Valley scented items, so I was disappointed that this doesn&#x27;t smell like Lily of the Valley.</li>
            <li> and it was awful.</li>

I even went retro and sprayed it on my light bulb so that in the evening, when I turned on the lamp, the fragrance wafted its way through the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my brother - good memories, delicious aroma.  Nice.</li>

            <li> I love this! I was so glad to get this!</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love the scent the only problem was the product leaked in the envelope. It needed to have a plastic on the mouth of the bottle just like the Dolce and Gabbana perfume was shipped.</li>
            <li> Needs more lily of the valley and less cowbell. Has a plastic, soapy undertone and even the bottle is bleh.</li>
            <li> I just did not like the smell of lily of the valley women perfume body oil,, its did not smell like this other I got, I did not order this I already had,,it was the price of the one third  0z roll on,</li>
            <li> This supposed to be &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34; oil, has nothing to do with real smell of &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I believe, that the Seller mislead the Buyers with this product. I do not know, how they created this oil, but it&#x27;s not what the Seller claimed. Forget about the bottle seller advertized, it&#x27;s not a round one, which I have received it.&lt;br /&gt;I believe, that this Seller purposely mislead and tricked buyers to spend money on something far away from real product. I can&#x27;t even named what kind of smell it is.? It doesn&#x27;t have a fresh scent of &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34; at all, it doesn&#x27;t have any flowerly scent.&lt;br /&gt;To me it&#x27;s awfull product.&lt;br /&gt;I will never recommend to anybody to buy this kind of product.</li>
            <li> I do not know what the odor is.  I&#x27;ll say not good</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remind me of fresh lily of the valley at all. It&#x27;s extremely strong and very musky smelling instead. I think it&#x27;s nice and yet not what i was hoping for at all. I really dind&#x27;t like that it leaked all over during shipping.</li>
            <li> I was very leery buying this after reading the reviews from people saying it didnt smell like Lily of the Valley. It DOES!!! I am SO glad I took the chance and bought it. It is rather strong but I use it sparingly and have had numerous compliments on it. I would think that perfume smells different on every woman but this one smelled just like it said on me. For the price it was worth a try. I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for many years. Am a great fan. My &amp;#34;signature scent!&amp;#34; Will continue to use this for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> Yes I do like the light scent and it is handy to carry with ya.</li>
            <li> I expected more lily of the valley fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant enough scent, but doesn&#x27;t smell anything like real Lily of the Valley.  Also, I didn&#x27;t find the scent very long lasting.  It&#x27;s just OK overall.</li>
            <li> It really smells like the perfume my Mother used to wear !  I bought a different brand and it was awful.</li>
            <li> This perfume does not smell like lily of the valley to me.  I smells like Pine-Sol!!  I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Very strong and a little goes a long way but right on the money when it comes to smelling like Lily of the Valley. Great deal.</li>
            <li> Stale, old smelling, awful. I developed a bad allergic reaction. Coughed for days wearing this for 5 mins. If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances, don&#x27;t buy this !!</li>
            <li> It is a lovely floral scent, however, it lasts about 15 minutes, no staying power</li>
            <li> I liked it however did not have the same fragrance,that Lilly of The Valley should of had so It was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of lily-of-the-valley. This perfume body oil roll-on smells like the flower and is convenient to carry with me. I have found that the scent lasts several hours.</li>
            <li> Oil makes a better base than alchohol because it doesn&#x27;t add that conflicting and generic scent. Oil also makes the scent last longer.</li>
            <li> nothing like the smell of lilly of the valley...when applied,very sticky&#x27;smelled more like a strange oil...will not buy again.thank you</li>
            <li> Lily of the valley scent is a very difficult one to get right as I&#x27;ve noticed from trying several brands.  This might not be as sweet and flowery as you would think you were going to get from something called lily of the valley but it has such a beautiful scent I had to buy a few more so I would be sure to have some back up bottles.  For the price I was so delighted!  Very pretty floral scent.  For the low cost, don&#x27;t be afraid to try it out.</li>
            <li> There must have been a mistake. This perfume does not smell like the Lily of the Valley that I know and love. More like... stinkweed.</li>
            <li> this lily of the valley is a wonderful scent..not as sweet as i would like it but still a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;great buy..great service..fast delivery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine scent,however I was disappointed that the glass bottle didn&#x27;t look like the picture: no curved glass, it&#x27;s just plain glass. I think the seller should put pictures of an actual bottle, because if you are buying it as a gift, the bottle may matter. Other than that, I am satisfied: it&#x27;s not cheap alcohol based perfume, it&#x27;s actually an oil, it smells so wonderfully and reminds me my mom&#x27;s favorite lily of the valley perfume. Great smell. If you don&#x27;t care about the bottle, it&#x27;s your perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to my original review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was extremely subtle, barely there. After some time it COMPLETELY disappeared leaving me with just unscented oil. DO NOT buy.</li>
            <li> Very nice perfume grade oil.</li>
            <li> I grew up with Lily of the Valley.  This smells nothing like it.  Threw it out.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and arrived in time to be a holiday gift. The recipiant was please with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for lily of the valley perfume and this did the trick.i will probably buy it again now that I know where to find it</li>
            <li> Bought this for a gift she loved it</li>
            <li> good morning&lt;br /&gt;  the excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this option&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones</li>
