            <li>soft, precise, no shedding, looks better than the picture</li>
            <li>brushes &amp; these are my new favorite go tos.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did when I got them was wash them!</li>
            <li>I use ever last single one of them and get a flawless application everytime no shedding</li>
            <li>The brushes are SUPER SUPER SOFT!!!!</li>
            <li>They also pickup the makeup really well and spread the cosmetics on skin smoothly.</li>
            <li>pleased and surprised at the value and quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li>they are easy to clean and remain soft</li>
            <li>So soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>then used them right away.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the right make brushes for a while now.</li>
            <li>amazing super soft and so far no shedding or damage</li>
            <li>For these brushes to be so cheap their like using high end brushes</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t shed that much at all so its not bad</li>
            <li>I will be using the eye brushes only as those are the only ones that seem to be great.</li>
            <li>but it will be great to have in the future possibly for travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast for me.</li>
            <li>Soft, easy to wash and blend so well</li>
            <li>I absolutely live them!!!</li>
            <li>People are mentioning some kind of powerful smell, i noticed this as well but only if i were to shove the brushed up my nose and take a huge wiff.  </li>
            <li>Having bought individual brushes for lots of $, my personal opinion is that the brushes are very nice.  </li>
            <li>Shedding is minimal and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to and does not have my eyeshadow all over the place.</li>
            <li>In the first picture you see 10</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a set of makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>The smell is no big deal, i didn&#x27;t notice it. :)</li>
            <li>This is my first set of make up brushes</li>
            <li>when you first receive them they smell HORRIBLE&lt;br /&gt;Firm  </li>
            <li>These are the first makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It is still fluffy and good and the fall out did not impact density, I just was not expecting.</li>
            <li>Good Starter makeup brush set, but bristles will begin to fall out after heavy use.</li>
            <li>I just got them today and they are soooooo soft!!!!</li>
            <li>The brushes r very soft does not meet my full expectations</li>
            <li>Easy to wash and quick dry time.</li>
            <li>I used them on my clients and will most likely buy a new pair for myself!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to pretty inexpensive brushes and for the price these a pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Super soft brushes.</li>
            <li>these nurses are super soft</li>
            <li>Strong wooden handles  </li>
            <li>Had them for a week and the bristles started coming out in large chunks.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really use it with mineral powder.</li>
            <li>BUT I REALLY LIKE THESE</li>
            <li>but I really have 11.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and rarely shed.</li>
            <li>HAD, They absolutely dont shed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup pro, nor do I know much about makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Hold product very well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>I have everything from Mac, Tarte, Sigma, smashbox, eco tools &amp; real techniques</li>
            <li>The price is very fare for the product they sell you</li>
            <li>When I first received these brushes three weeks ago from today, I immediately noticed the uneven and crackly clear coat on some of the brushes, but I was willing to overlook this, as it was probably just a cosmetic issue and the brushes were soft and seemingly good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>two favorite brushes from this set are the large flat top kabuki brush and the fluffy blending brush that I use for my eyes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t smell any sort of odor like the other reviewers, nonetheless i still made sure to wash them before use.</li>
            <li>I own a few of the high end set and this are comparable to those.</li>
            <li>However on the flat top kabuki brush (larger one not the teeny one,  )upon first washing 2 hair plugs</li>
            <li>Make up products transfer easily to face without having to drag make up brush too much.</li>
            <li>Really soft and pretty came just in time</li>
            <li>Great for the price only complaint is the eye shadow brushes don&#x27;t hold powder very well.</li>
            <li>I have older Mary Kay brushes and these</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft but firm which is exactly what I needed. :)</li>
            <li>These really are professional brushes!</li>
            <li>High quality item.  </li>
            <li>High quality...</li>
            <li>4 Stars only because of the few  stray bristles in all very soft good quality...</li>
            <li>Now if you can get past that, the brushes are quite nice, the powder brushes are great, they are firm and soft, so you can apply powder well, AND in the desired spot, unlike some of the other brushes on amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before ordering I had decided on going with the synthetic brushes because I have read that they don&#x27;t waste/absorb as much product as the natural brushes</li>
            <li>They are soooooo soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also liked using the smaller brushed for smaller area to cover and my eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s real wood its more like a wooden design that&#x27;s not really a problem for me</li>
            <li>even with regular washes I have yet to experience any shedding, and the bristles have the right amount of softness yet firmness.</li>
            <li>Super soft, little to no shedding and the blending and buffing brushes alone are worth the money.</li>
            <li>Can apply my makeup just the way I want, and with a price I can live with.</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft on the tips.</li>
            <li>The ones for yourface are are very soft.  </li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft</li>
            <li>very soft hairs that don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>I even gently wash mine and let them air dry and have not lost the first bristle</li>
            <li>I washed prior to first use.</li>
            <li>but I was worried about the softness, these brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure what I would ever be able to use it for.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft and they do not fall out at all!</li>
            <li>Ok brushes - recipient was excited for her gift, but overwhelming smell of awful chemicals when opened for the first time.</li>
            <li>I use them on a daily basis and clean them regularly</li>
            <li>, The handle is not strong, though, and detaches easily.</li>
            <li>their super soft I&#x27;m buying a second set to have as back up</li>
            <li>My (previous) favorite brushes were Everyday Mineral, but a face brush from them costs close to as much as this whole set of 11.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are great, and didnt have that smell people are always so afraid of.</li>
            <li>That was a bummer, but I clearly didn&#x27;t read the instructions on how to  wash them.</li>
            <li>They seem well constructed and sturdy, yet soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but synthetic.</li>
            <li>,THEY ARE REALLY SOFT AND</li>
            <li>On par with professional brushes.</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by these brushes.</li>
            <li>They are so soft.  </li>
            <li>So soft .</li>
            <li>Make up nearly glides on with these brushes</li>
            <li>Outside of that the other brushes seem to be holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this brush a dozen or so times, but since I have used it more than any other I have to assume that the rest of the brushes will ultimately suffer from this same problem.</li>
            <li>I just played with the brushes to get extra hairs out (which is normal)</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for something to start with yet they work well also professionally.</li>
            <li>Even the pencil brush is soft enough it doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really using the small kabuki brush with the flat top and round bottom to stipple my foundation on.</li>
            <li>Ok, seriously!</li>
            <li>The fluffier looking brushes aren&#x27;t very dense, but I have other brushes</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how soft and EXTREMELY sturdy they are.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent brush set def not real wood or bamboo</li>
            <li>One thing, but not bad enough to lower a star is the small kabuki brush could be denser so that it would be stiffer.</li>
            <li>and now that they are dry they still are soft!</li>
            <li>Like I said about the other brushes they&#x27;re extremely soft!!</li>
            <li>The hairs are not packed tight and are very flimsy.</li>
            <li>They are soft, do not shed, have sturdy handles, and a brush for every single type of makeup you may possibly use.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping and such a great price.</li>
            <li> soft, precise, no shedding, looks better than the picture</li>
            <li> brushes &amp; these are my new favorite go tos.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did when I got them was wash them!</li>
            <li> I use ever last single one of them and get a flawless application everytime no shedding</li>
            <li> The brushes are SUPER SUPER SOFT!!!!</li>
            <li> They also pickup the makeup really well and spread the cosmetics on skin smoothly.</li>
            <li> pleased and surprised at the value and quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> they are easy to clean and remain soft</li>
            <li> So soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> then used them right away.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the right make brushes for a while now.</li>
            <li> amazing super soft and so far no shedding or damage</li>
            <li> For these brushes to be so cheap their like using high end brushes</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t shed that much at all so its not bad</li>
            <li> I will be using the eye brushes only as those are the only ones that seem to be great.</li>
            <li> but it will be great to have in the future possibly for travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast for me.</li>
            <li> Soft, easy to wash and blend so well</li>
            <li> I absolutely live them!!!</li>
            <li> People are mentioning some kind of powerful smell, i noticed this as well but only if i were to shove the brushed up my nose and take a huge wiff.  </li>
            <li> Having bought individual brushes for lots of $, my personal opinion is that the brushes are very nice.  </li>
            <li> Shedding is minimal and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to and does not have my eyeshadow all over the place.</li>
            <li> In the first picture you see 10</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a set of makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> The smell is no big deal, i didn&#x27;t notice it. :)</li>
            <li> This is my first set of make up brushes</li>
            <li> when you first receive them they smell HORRIBLE&lt;br /&gt;Firm  </li>
            <li> These are the first makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> It is still fluffy and good and the fall out did not impact density, I just was not expecting.</li>
            <li> Good Starter makeup brush set, but bristles will begin to fall out after heavy use.</li>
            <li> I just got them today and they are soooooo soft!!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes r very soft does not meet my full expectations</li>
            <li> Easy to wash and quick dry time.</li>
            <li> I used them on my clients and will most likely buy a new pair for myself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to pretty inexpensive brushes and for the price these a pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes.</li>
            <li> these nurses are super soft</li>
            <li> Strong wooden handles  </li>
            <li> Had them for a week and the bristles started coming out in large chunks.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really use it with mineral powder.</li>
            <li> BUT I REALLY LIKE THESE</li>
            <li> but I really have 11.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and rarely shed.</li>
            <li> HAD, They absolutely dont shed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup pro, nor do I know much about makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Hold product very well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> I have everything from Mac, Tarte, Sigma, smashbox, eco tools &amp; real techniques</li>
            <li> The price is very fare for the product they sell you</li>
            <li> When I first received these brushes three weeks ago from today, I immediately noticed the uneven and crackly clear coat on some of the brushes, but I was willing to overlook this, as it was probably just a cosmetic issue and the brushes were soft and seemingly good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> two favorite brushes from this set are the large flat top kabuki brush and the fluffy blending brush that I use for my eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t smell any sort of odor like the other reviewers, nonetheless i still made sure to wash them before use.</li>
            <li> I own a few of the high end set and this are comparable to those.</li>
            <li> However on the flat top kabuki brush (larger one not the teeny one,  )upon first washing 2 hair plugs</li>
            <li> Make up products transfer easily to face without having to drag make up brush too much.</li>
            <li> Really soft and pretty came just in time</li>
            <li> Great for the price only complaint is the eye shadow brushes don&#x27;t hold powder very well.</li>
            <li> I have older Mary Kay brushes and these</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft but firm which is exactly what I needed. :)</li>
            <li> These really are professional brushes!</li>
            <li> High quality item.  </li>
            <li> High quality...</li>
            <li> 4 Stars only because of the few  stray bristles in all very soft good quality...</li>
            <li> Now if you can get past that, the brushes are quite nice, the powder brushes are great, they are firm and soft, so you can apply powder well, AND in the desired spot, unlike some of the other brushes on amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before ordering I had decided on going with the synthetic brushes because I have read that they don&#x27;t waste/absorb as much product as the natural brushes</li>
            <li> They are soooooo soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also liked using the smaller brushed for smaller area to cover and my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s real wood its more like a wooden design that&#x27;s not really a problem for me</li>
            <li> even with regular washes I have yet to experience any shedding, and the bristles have the right amount of softness yet firmness.</li>
            <li> Super soft, little to no shedding and the blending and buffing brushes alone are worth the money.</li>
            <li> Can apply my makeup just the way I want, and with a price I can live with.</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft on the tips.</li>
            <li> The ones for yourface are are very soft.  </li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft</li>
            <li> very soft hairs that don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> I even gently wash mine and let them air dry and have not lost the first bristle</li>
            <li> I washed prior to first use.</li>
            <li> but I was worried about the softness, these brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what I would ever be able to use it for.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft and they do not fall out at all!</li>
            <li> Ok brushes - recipient was excited for her gift, but overwhelming smell of awful chemicals when opened for the first time.</li>
            <li> I use them on a daily basis and clean them regularly</li>
            <li> , The handle is not strong, though, and detaches easily.</li>
            <li> their super soft I&#x27;m buying a second set to have as back up</li>
            <li> My (previous) favorite brushes were Everyday Mineral, but a face brush from them costs close to as much as this whole set of 11.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are great, and didnt have that smell people are always so afraid of.</li>
            <li> That was a bummer, but I clearly didn&#x27;t read the instructions on how to  wash them.</li>
            <li> They seem well constructed and sturdy, yet soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but synthetic.</li>
            <li> ,THEY ARE REALLY SOFT AND</li>
            <li> On par with professional brushes.</li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by these brushes.</li>
            <li> They are so soft.  </li>
            <li> So soft .</li>
            <li> Make up nearly glides on with these brushes</li>
            <li> Outside of that the other brushes seem to be holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush a dozen or so times, but since I have used it more than any other I have to assume that the rest of the brushes will ultimately suffer from this same problem.</li>
            <li> I just played with the brushes to get extra hairs out (which is normal)</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for something to start with yet they work well also professionally.</li>
            <li> Even the pencil brush is soft enough it doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really using the small kabuki brush with the flat top and round bottom to stipple my foundation on.</li>
            <li> Ok, seriously!</li>
            <li> The fluffier looking brushes aren&#x27;t very dense, but I have other brushes</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how soft and EXTREMELY sturdy they are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent brush set def not real wood or bamboo</li>
            <li> One thing, but not bad enough to lower a star is the small kabuki brush could be denser so that it would be stiffer.</li>
            <li> and now that they are dry they still are soft!</li>
            <li> Like I said about the other brushes they&#x27;re extremely soft!!</li>
            <li> The hairs are not packed tight and are very flimsy.</li>
            <li> They are soft, do not shed, have sturdy handles, and a brush for every single type of makeup you may possibly use.</li>
            <li> i have used in the past, and yes they have a strange smell at first</li>
            <li> was dissapointed with the flat foundation brush.</li>
            <li> The little pouch they come in is kind of useless in my opinion, but I didn&#x27;t buy them for the pouch anyway.  </li>
            <li> There are still some other brushes you&#x27;ll need missing from this set (like a dense eyeshadow blending brush, and a thin eyeliner brush) but this provides a lot on it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re soft and have little to no shedding at all.</li>
            <li> There really is a wide variety of brushed in this bundle.</li>
            <li> Soft, firm and doesn&#x27;t have a stink smell to it like some brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using these brushes for a long time.</li>
            <li> excuse my nails in the pictures they need to be done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to buy any others for a long time.  </li>
            <li> In the second picture they are wet along with my other brushes that I had just finish washing.</li>
            <li> when i took the brushes out of the plastic i noticed that some of the brushes had loose hairs.</li>
            <li> brush hairs were loose</li>
            <li> I have an expensive brush from bare minerals that doesn&#x27;t even compare to the ones in this set, these are so so much softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying the 8pcs black handled set next!</li>
            <li> They are super soft and the quality isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> However, this was proven false a few weeks later when the bristles of the flat brush began to completely separate from the handle, likely due to an issue with the adhesive.</li>
            <li> Minimal to no shedding.</li>
            <li> It says not to get the bamboo part wet</li>
            <li> Also, before ordering this I had trouble finding a set that contained all the brush types that I would actually use</li>
            <li> synthetic bristles not real.</li>
            <li> I just keep them bristles up in an empty jar.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was skeptical on buying these brushes, but the price got to me. Im glad i purchased them. Not only are they affordable, but the brushes are great! they&#x27;re soft and have little to no shedding at all. Easy to wash and quick dry time. Fav brush is the blending brush. It does exactly what I want it to and does not have my eyeshadow all over the place. Overall, love these brushes !!</li>
            <li> These are incredible to work with.  I do makeup for an indoor colorguard and my brushes take a beating with those girls.  These are so durable and they apply the makeup wonderfully.  My guard looks great this season.</li>
            <li> Love them soft and works great</li>
            <li> Ordered these on the 30th, today is the 3rd with a weekend in between. I absolutely live them!!!</li>
            <li> Brushes are alright, but it came a week late, and THAT wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Brushes are really nice! I can tell the quality when I use the brushes, how the brisels hold the makeup. Perfect, thank you!</li>
            <li> These are a great buy for the price. They seem well constructed and sturdy, yet soft. I&#x27;ve improved my eye makeup application a great deal with these. Also find the foundation brush helpful- had never used one before but am getting the hang of it. Fun set to play with!</li>
            <li> I guess this is a brush set for people who are just starting out with makeup or maybe even for a child that likes to play with brushes/makeup. Some of the brushes are so small that you will have no use for them. Others are not dense at all like they should be. The hairs are not packed tight and are very flimsy. I will be using the eye brushes only as those are the only ones that seem to be great.</li>
            <li> Really soft and pretty came just in time</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful. They feel sturdy. The brushes are soft. They did have a chemical smell when I opened the package. The smell went away by the next day. There&#x27;s a brush for everything. Minimal to no shedding. I&#x27;ve used at least 7 of the brushes in the past 2 weeks and have found one loose strand. One thing, but not bad enough to lower a star is the small kabuki brush could be denser so that it would be stiffer. Can&#x27;t really use it with mineral powder. Can&#x27;t beat the price. A fraction of the cost of my #56 from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft on the tips. When I received them one was already broken but nothing a little glue can&#x27;t fix. Outside of that the other brushes seem to be holding up just fine. Also the hair does not shed from the brushes. I&#x27;m used to pretty inexpensive brushes and for the price these a pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really using the small kabuki brush with the flat top and round bottom to stipple my foundation on. It&#x27;s produced satisfying results. I&#x27;ve also liked using the smaller brushed for smaller area to cover and my eyes. The bristles are soft but synthetic. There really is a wide variety of brushed in this bundle. The quality is exceptional for the price and I would recommend this makeup noobs or budget savy friends.</li>
            <li> SO I ORDERED THESE ON SUNDAY AND RECIEVED THEM TUESDAY ,THEY ARE REALLY SOFT AND JUST WHAT I WANTED.. THE BRUSHES LOOK AND FEEL LIKE GREAT QUALITY. IVE USED A COUPLE FROM AMAZON LIKE SHANY BRUSHES AND THE COASTAL SCENTS ONES.. I LOVE MY 22PCS COASTAL SCETS BRUSHES .. BUT I REALLY LIKE THESE TOO I USED THEM TODAY TO APPLY MY MAKEUP AND ALL THE BRUSHES WORK AND FEEL AMAZING,,  DEF RECOMMEND THESE TO WHOEVER IS LOOKING FOR GOOD QUALITY INEXPENSIVE BRUSHES! (:</li>
            <li> Like I said about the other brushes they&#x27;re extremely soft!!😝😍</li>
            <li> Great variety of sizes and types. Super soft brushes. I have older Mary Kay brushes and these are way softer. I wash every couple days in shampoo and they are maintaining shape and softness.  I washed prior to first use. They come in a canvas bag and at this point I am not using it  but it will be great to have in the future possibly for travel.&lt;br /&gt;There are dense brushes for foundation or cream powder shadows and fluffy brushes for powders.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased and surprised at the value and quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> On par with professional brushes. For the price def recommend. Ive been using for a few months and no complaints</li>
            <li> Very nice set of make up brushes for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much. I love it.</li>
            <li> Ok, seriously! These are awesome for the price. I love them. Will definitely buy again if I have to.</li>
            <li> Fantastic products. Every single brush is perfect. Can&#x27;t fault it. The bristles do not stay on your face after use, which I thought they might. Make up products transfer easily to face without having to drag make up brush too much.</li>
            <li> Even though they were only 8.00 for me I was very surprised at how soft and EXTREMELY sturdy they are. The first thing I did when I got them was wash them! They didn&#x27;t come apart, NO SHEDDING AT ALL, and now that they are dry they still are soft! In the first picture you see 10 but I somehow only took a picture of 10 but I really have 11. In the second picture they are wet along with my other brushes that I had just finish washing.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:d230e8464e212ee89ba2472f0596413]] These makeup brushes are amazing! They are soft, do not shed, have sturdy handles, and a brush for every single type of makeup you may possibly use. I am extremely pleased and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a set of makeup brushes! They also pickup the makeup really well and spread the cosmetics on skin smoothly. I love these!    **I received this product at no cost to me in exchange for my unbiased opinion.**</li>
            <li> I saw a YouTuber review this and I had to see it for my self the blending blush is like a Mac 217 and the foundation brushes are so smooth and amazing, this is the total package you get a blending brush which is hard to find in a set. A precision brush to smudge eyeshadow on your lower eye.  And all the brushes are all for your face.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for the price.  I own a few of the high end set and this are comparable to those. Shipping was super fast for me. I ordered on Saturday and they arrived on Monday.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They are absolutely exactly as described  (if not better). They work great for applying the smoky eye eyeshadow I love. The ones for yourface are are very soft.  I even gently wash mine and let them air dry and have not lost the first bristle</li>
            <li> These brushes are sooo good., The handle is not strong, though, and detaches easily. its best to hot glue them when they do come off. The brushes are so soft and rarely shed.</li>
            <li> For these brushes to be so cheap their like using high end brushes these nurses are super soft I use ever last single one of them and get a flawless application everytime no shedding and they clean really well great product</li>
            <li> For the price they&#x27;re OKAY. Had them for a week and the bristles started coming out in large chunks. I don&#x27;t use a thick foundation and I hadn&#x27;t washed them yet. When I did wash them, the bristles actually all came out in a couple of face brushes.</li>
            <li> Great for the price only complaint is the eye shadow brushes don&#x27;t hold powder very well.</li>
            <li> I love them. I just got them today and they are soooooo soft!!!! They didn&#x27;t have an odor. I washed them and the silver part of the two small bamboo sticks lifted up, so they&#x27;re broken but I can still use them. That was a bummer, but I clearly didn&#x27;t read the instructions on how to  wash them. It says not to get the bamboo part wet but oh well. I still love them and would recommend them to anyone looking for a cheap brush set with great quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes!  Soft, firm and doesn&#x27;t have a stink smell to it like some brushes. I have recommended these brushes to all my cosmotology friends.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I have been searching and searching for a good brush set from amazon for a while and I finally decided on these and I am very happy with my purchase. Before ordering I had decided on going with the synthetic brushes because I have read that they don&#x27;t waste/absorb as much product as the natural brushes but I was worried about the softness, these brushes are so soft! I have an expensive brush from bare minerals that doesn&#x27;t even compare to the ones in this set, these are so so much softer. Also, before ordering this I had trouble finding a set that contained all the brush types that I would actually use and I am very happy with all of the one in this set except for the small angle brush. The tip is too thick and blunt to use for eyeliner so I&#x27;m not sure what I would ever be able to use it for. Maybe if I applied powder to my eyebrows with a brush I could use it for that but that isn&#x27;t something I currently do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two favorite brushes from this set are the large flat top kabuki brush and the fluffy blending brush that I use for my eyes. I would definitely purchase this again!!</li>
            <li> Bought this set.  Excellent quality and performance.  However on the flat top kabuki brush (larger one not the teeny one,  )upon first washing 2 hair plugs approx 8 -15 hairs/ bristles each fell out. I was shocked.  It is still fluffy and good and the fall out did not impact density, I just was not expecting.</li>
            <li> they dont make my face look cakey unlike other cosmetic applying brushs i have used in the past, and yes they have a strange smell at first but it does go away , very nice brushes love them !</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes. There are still some other brushes you&#x27;ll need missing from this set (like a dense eyeshadow blending brush, and a thin eyeliner brush) but this provides a lot on it&#x27;s own.  I really love how easy these are to clean, and they don&#x27;t shed.  I&#x27;ll be using these brushes for a long time.</li>
            <li> What i noticed;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everything was great.  brushes work great. People are mentioning some kind of powerful smell, i noticed this as well but only if i were to shove the brushed up my nose and take a huge wiff.  The smell is no big deal, i didn&#x27;t notice it. :)</li>
            <li> Awesome quality handsome design.......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent brush set def not real wood or bamboo but that&#x27;s whatever.&lt;br /&gt;Its synthetic bristles not real. But the brushes work great don&#x27;t shed that much at all so its not bad</li>
            <li> Good quality! I love these brushes. 👍</li>
            <li> I would just like to say that theses brushes are awesome and great price, just in love with theses brushes being a makeup artist you want great quality of products when working with your clients. My clients also love them</li>
            <li> THESE ARE BY FAR THE BEST SET OF BRUSHES I EVER HAD, They absolutely dont shed. They are so soft, they give a complete coverage and smell wonderful, buy this product,</li>
            <li> 4 Stars only because of the few  stray bristles in all very soft good quality...</li>
            <li> Gave as gift. High quality item.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup pro, nor do I know much about makeup brushes. I&#x27;m used to the cheap ones you pickup in Walmart or order from e.l.f., so I was really impressed with this set of brushes. The bristles are extremely soft and they do not fall out at all! They feel so nice on my skin. The handles are very nice quality and secure - they&#x27;re not lose or feel like they&#x27;ll fall out of the metal holding. For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat this set with 11 amazing brushes. If you&#x27;re an amateur like me, this is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
            <li> The brushes are to soft for what I payed for Not good. Also the Flat brush to soft for my base makeup.</li>
            <li> Good Starter makeup brush set, but bristles will begin to fall out after heavy use.</li>
            <li> I loved her&lt;br /&gt;And I loved the masterly packaging</li>
            <li> very good and better price</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price! This is my first set of make up brushes and I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ve lived without a set! I would definitely recommend for anyone getting started in make up. I love this set. Shedding is minimal and super easy to clean. Hold product very well.</li>
            <li> The brushes r very soft does not meet my full expectations</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes on a monday evening, and i recieved them on tuesday. when i took the brushes out of the plastic i noticed that some of the brushes had loose hairs. Once you pluck the hairs out with a tweezer the brushes work quite well, but the brush hairs do feel quite like plastic, which was a turn off for me while using them. Now if you can get past that, the brushes are quite nice, the powder brushes are great, they are firm and soft, so you can apply powder well, AND in the desired spot, unlike some of the other brushes on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-  Cons-&lt;br /&gt;Soft  when you first receive them they smell HORRIBLE&lt;br /&gt;Firm  brush hairs were loose&lt;br /&gt;applies to where you want  feel like plastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But bottom line, i would recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> My mom got me these for X-mas and to be honest I was&#x27;t excited because of the brand. HOWEVER these are awesome. Super soft, little to no shedding and the blending and buffing brushes alone are worth the money. Very happy with these.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product. Do not Oder!!!!</li>
            <li> the brushes are awesome and great variety. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes. Soft. Fluffy. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Having bought individual brushes for lots of $, my personal opinion is that the brushes are very nice.  Can apply my makeup just the way I want, and with a price I can live with.</li>
            <li> Very soft. The smell isnt as bad as people are saying. Some of the brushes are better than others.&lt;br /&gt;I was dissapointed with the flat foundation brush. It has a lot of fall out.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the face brushes also have fall out but not as much.&lt;br /&gt;The eye brushes are good! Besides the angled eyeshadow brush where the hairs look a little messy but I&#x27;ll see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for brushes for cream foundation you might want to look somewhere else because in my opinion none of the brushes are dense enough. They would work wonderfully for  powder foundation though! Overall I am pretty happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;Also excuse my nails in the pictures they need to be done.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes amazing quality I love them their super soft I&#x27;m buying a second set to have as back up lol I&#x27;m happy with the purchase they arrived before the date they gave me</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by these brushes. I didn&#x27;t smell any sort of odor like the other reviewers, nonetheless i still made sure to wash them before use. I have had them for almost 2 months now and even with regular washes I have yet to experience any shedding, and the bristles have the right amount of softness yet firmness. I am very very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good brush set,had a funny smell but after washing smell was gone. I experienced no shedding. Cannot beat the price for so many brushes.</li>
            <li> amazing super soft and so far no shedding or damage I am in love</li>
            <li> When I first received these brushes three weeks ago from today, I immediately noticed the uneven and crackly clear coat on some of the brushes, but I was willing to overlook this, as it was probably just a cosmetic issue and the brushes were soft and seemingly good quality for the price. However, this was proven false a few weeks later when the bristles of the flat brush began to completely separate from the handle, likely due to an issue with the adhesive. I&#x27;ve only used this brush a dozen or so times, but since I have used it more than any other I have to assume that the rest of the brushes will ultimately suffer from this same problem. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I freaking love these brushes!!  They are so soft.  These are the first makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I think the price was exactly right, and the quality is great.  I also like the variety of brushes you get... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to buy any others for a long time.  The little pouch they come in is kind of useless in my opinion, but I didn&#x27;t buy them for the pouch anyway.  I just keep them bristles up in an empty jar.  Recommended for sure!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and super soft. I got them with very low expectations but they worked great!. One did break but I partially blame myself for that one. I used them on my clients and will most likely buy a new pair for myself!</li>
            <li> THEY SHED AS SOON AS I WASHED THEM :(</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes, they are soft, wash well without fall out and work great with creams &amp; powder. Everything I need for a contoured face and plenty extras. Price can&#x27;t be beat, worth a lot more than what I payed. I have everything from Mac, Tarte, Sigma, smashbox, eco tools &amp; real techniques brushes &amp; these are my new favorite go tos. Don&#x27;t hesitate just buy you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> Love these for their price!</li>
            <li> So happy with these brushes! Fast shipping and such a great price. The brushes are soft but firm which is exactly what I needed. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes. I definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for something to start with yet they work well also professionally. I love the hair on them&lt;br /&gt; Soft, easy to wash and blend so well</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! Very little to no shedding! Mine had no bad smell either, plus the shipping was fair given I am station overseas in japan</li>
            <li> This review is for the 11pcs bamboo handle set.  Stunned by the quality of these!  My (previous) favorite brushes were Everyday Mineral, but a face brush from them costs close to as much as this whole set of 11.  I&#x27;ll be buying the 8pcs black handled set next!</li>
            <li> Need a stronger bond glue to hold brushes together. However great appication</li>
            <li> The bag it came with was kinda, eh, but I didnt buy it for the bag. The brushes are great, and didnt have that smell people are always so afraid of. I just played with the brushes to get extra hairs out (which is normal) then used them right away.</li>
            <li> Feel for the brush is great by far some of the best brushes I have bought for the cost</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the right make brushes for a while now. But I  wanted to make sure they were dimensional. They are awesome.</li>
            <li> OMG!!!!  The brushes are SUPER SUPER SOFT!!!! I love them they are easy to clean and remain soft&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t gotten any shedding of the brush hairs which is perfect.</li>
            <li> The fountain brush broke after a week but glued ur back on.otherwise I like them allot they are very soft and good size.</li>
            <li> bought this kit for my wife and she loves it. great product fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great for my day to day makeup even Though I barely use all the brushes</li>
            <li> The price is very fare for the product they sell you I wanted to clean them before I wrote a review to see if they shead or broke and not at all. They are super soft and the quality isn&#x27;t bad. If I had to say something negative about the product (which some people might disagree) ild say that i don&#x27;t like the size of the smaller brushes; another thing (but it&#x27;s really no biggy) is I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s real wood its more like a wooden design that&#x27;s not really a problem for me but, It might look a bit deceiving</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the small part. Kinda small.&lt;br /&gt;But overall the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;Try it out too so you&#x27;ll see the result.</li>
            <li> Just as ordered, great product!</li>
            <li> Gave these to my grand daughter &amp; she loves them</li>
            <li> Nice, quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Best brushes I have ever used. I&#x27;m accustomed to using the cheap elf brushes but I needed a lot more so I grabbed this set. They are so incredibly soft and they are great for blending. Even the pencil brush is soft enough it doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes. Love it.</li>
            <li> Another set of brushes that I love. Very soft and they get the job done. I can&#x27;t go without them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a couple of months now and they are wonderful. They are soooooo soft and gentle on the skin. I use them on a daily basis and clean them regularly and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding. The fluffier looking brushes aren&#x27;t very dense, but I have other brushes so I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;m a sucker for brushes and these are such a steal. If you&#x27;re looking for a variety of different face and eye brushes and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, I definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Wife loves them, they seem to be good quality, the MAC brushes seemed better to me, but I am a guy so what do I know.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and are great applicators. I recommend them 100%.</li>
            <li> Great set for the price!</li>
            <li> Ok brushes - recipient was excited for her gift, but overwhelming smell of awful chemicals when opened for the first time.</li>
            <li> These really are professional brushes! I suspect they just don&#x27;t have any brand name printed on them. VERY good quality brushes!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice and there are so many of them which is even better. So soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> soft, precise, no shedding, looks better than the picture</li>
            <li> Strong wooden handles  very soft hairs that don&#x27;t fall out. Best eye shadow brushes perfect for beginners blending. I use these everyday for my makeup routine</li>
            <li> Love these , no shedding !! So soft . Make up nearly glides on with these brushes</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to everyone. Prompt delivery, grate price, free shipment and good quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy, with it!</li>
            <li> Amazing! High quality...no shedding--amazing brush set! Check out my video review on YouTube. Search TinaKnowsMakeup</li>
