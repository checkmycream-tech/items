            <li>It is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This Argan oil is superb quality!</li>
            <li>The fact that Organic products is best for your hair is a plus!</li>
            <li>My package arrived in perfect condition, with no leakage.  </li>
            <li>My package arrived in perfect condition, with no leakage.  </li>
            <li>Still a very good product</li>
            <li>Thank you, \\&quot;Slice of Nature\\&quot; for a great prodact at a great price!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for your skin and your hair.  </li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>gives a great shine.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing skin product!</li>
            <li>I had been doing a lot of research into argan oil and this seller has a great price and good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it tastes good</li>
            <li>and the taste is quite good.</li>
            <li>My hair has regained it healthy boucing curls!  </li>
            <li>Slice of Nature is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>I really liked Slice of Natures&#x27;s info on the Argan Oils.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say it is by far one of the best oils I had ever used on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>First time purchase of Argan Oil, and after having read all the great reviews about its benefits</li>
            <li>The product is a very light oil that even I (with oily skin) can use on my face - it absorbs immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue.  </li>
            <li>Wait there is more.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile my cuticles and nailbeds are looking better than they ever have, because after I put it on my face, I rub the excess into my nails.</li>
            <li>I use solar oil on my nails which I love</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting more for Mother&#x27;s Day...</li>
            <li>I received the oil and am much more pleased with the quailty and results.  </li>
            <li>It would have been 5 stars if the applicator worked better.</li>
            <li>I decided to try another brand as I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a good quality oil, and after trying this &#x27;other&#x27; brand I quickly realized how much BETTER quality &#x27;Slice of Natures\\&quot; is!!!  </li>
            <li>When I first bought this I gave it a good review.</li>
            <li>The customer service is efficient and friendly too!</li>
            <li>strong odor can have many causes.</li>
            <li>Then my face feels so silky smooth that I keep touching it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fully into my skin and very quickly so it does not interfere with my makeup regime.  </li>
            <li>First, they do seem to be a nice company and were easy to deal with.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil was my first choice as being the best and Olive Oil came second.</li>
            <li>Is it possible that some of those reviews are from people who just want to believe that  the oil is doing great things for them.</li>
            <li>I have been using the oil twice a day under a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but so far so good with this product.</li>
            <li>So far my skin has been looking more youthful and my acne has gotten better.</li>
            <li>that I have finally convinced my fiance (a man&#x27;s man lol) to use it on his rosacea and he is very pleased with the reduced redness and bettered condition of HIS skin in only a week&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the amount you get and no junk mixed in.</li>
            <li>True argan oil is not supposed to have this scent.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy felling.  </li>
            <li>Based upon the reviews some people stated it dissipates quickly within the skin</li>
            <li>Has a bit of scent but goes away quickly</li>
            <li>The following is what I received from a very reputable seller on Ebay.</li>
            <li>Some have likened a strong odor to producers failing to be selective in harvesting the fruit, resulting in a strong goat-like odor, or oil can become old.</li>
            <li>I use this product every day morning and night and at 31 yrs old I am soooo glad I found Argan oil now</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to have an all-in-one product where I can take care of everything at the same time</li>
            <li>I was hoping that it would help with my acne, dullness, and smile lines.</li>
            <li>The spray/dropper works like a charm giving you just the right amount in one shot.</li>
            <li>This extracted oil results in a strong roasted nutty odor and is used primarily for culinary purposes-</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this oil, it is one of the best thing nature have to offer,i use it as a facial moisturizer in the morning and at night, your face will feel so soft and trust me it will even out your complexion,take care of your blemishes , this is a miracle oil.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product really is great.</li>
            <li>This has been the best thing I have ever used to soften the dry patches on my arm and it absorbs extremely well, but I bought this argan oil specifically to use on my face.</li>
            <li>Slice of Nature has very fast shipping</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been using other products for this as well) and smile lines, but my face does have a nice glow</li>
            <li>I have been to Morocco and have seen how this oil is made first hand.  </li>
            <li>am learning to use it on my hair, which is in pretty good condition, but also prone to dryness, so I don&#x27;t have a full report on that yet, but I do see vast improvement in the lack of tangles when combing my wet hair after a shower.  </li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on how luscious and long my hair look.     </li>
            <li>I live in SoCal and when ever the Santa Ana winds come or we have that kind of dry condition-my skin welts up and rashes.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that there is no added fragrance, just the natural argan fruit, which is so mild that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>100% Pure Virgin Argan Oil about four months ago</li>
            <li>Before, I used the 100% Pure Virgin Argan Oil I was using Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask I bought from Folica.</li>
            <li>I have been learning a lot about Argan and have found the following to be accurate.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I had never seen my hair grow out that fast.</li>
            <li>Also, I really like how this smooths my curly hair for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I asked them if they have organic certificate and about weight of product - couple days ago it showed 2 oz, but really it is 1.7 oz</li>
            <li>My skin is very moisturized using this from head to toes-</li>
            <li>If too much of the kernel is left in the oil, it can degrade more quickly, resulting in an unpleasant odor.\\&quot;  This seller also included a brochure about their Eccocert Organic Fair Trade certification.  </li>
            <li>the bottle did leak during shipping and smeared the packaging but the bottle was full when arrived (must&#x27;ve been a tiny leak).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend..</li>
            <li>However, their oil is not of high quality.  </li>
            <li>I have used it only for a couple of days in addition to my regular routine and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>By the end of the week, it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old</li>
            <li>and they are completely reliable.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my face is soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>&amp; I would definitely re-purchase this oil and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>am thrilled to say that this product has not only vastly softened and smoothed my very dry skin, it does so without need of a regular daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>There is a slight nutty smell (not a bad smell), but it quickly goes away within a few minutes after applying.  </li>
            <li>It has been doing a wonderful job of clearing up what was a total disaster, my entire face was terribly broken out from that previous product, and now it is almost entirely gone.  </li>
            <li>:)product goes a very long way, and I bought the small bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was mid-horrible breakout caused by an anti-aging product (with the initials OoO lol) which resulted in painful cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>It did make my hair a little shiner, less frizz, and more control over it.</li>
            <li>I spent too much money on different hair products and hair oils only to get burned in the end.</li>
            <li>I now live in AZ and my skin is dry and gets red flaky patches.  </li>
            <li>It also transformed my thin, somewhat wavy hair into the one full of body and waves!  </li>
            <li>help for my dry and sensitive skin issues.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> help for my dry and sensitive skin issues.  </li>
            <li> Then it all sinks right into the skin in a just few minutes.</li>
            <li> but although it absorbs quicker than the Raw Organic Oil, it&#x27;s absolutely overpriced.</li>
            <li> I have very thick full hair which passes my shoulders about three inches.</li>
            <li> After using for over a month, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s been much help with the acne</li>
            <li> I recently bought some Shea butter and this Argan oil and it soothes my skin - no rashing and dry skin peeling off.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s only 2oz, you only need to use a little bit at a time so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> which really isn&#x27;t that bad), but that goes away really quick.</li>
            <li> another product to check out is the African black soap.</li>
            <li> It took a few days but all my dry red patches are gone!</li>
            <li> so I was not thrilled by that and looking for natural repairs for that as well as</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I used it after I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> and I only need two pumps of the spray bottle to tame the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very faint and disappears very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very long hair (down to her butt)</li>
            <li> It may really be the beauty secret that people claim it to be!</li>
            <li> It has a very faint scent that will go away in 1 minute, and the oil will be absorbed in one minute as well.  </li>
            <li> very little of this product goes a very long way, and I bought the small bottle.  </li>
            <li> I used 100% Pure Cold Pressed Olive Oil.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on an impure product.</li>
            <li> Oil is very thick and concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Sliceof Nature Virgin 100% Raw Organic Argan Oil is a product I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and always had very bad acne also on my back.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my face for the past month.</li>

            <li> My daughter has very frizzy hair &amp; I purchased this product based on all the reviews.  My daughter has very long hair (down to her butt) and I only need two pumps of the spray bottle to tame the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;.  I also use it on my skin &amp; it works wonders.  The oil absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy felling.  It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Tres bon produit pour les peaux seches , abimees par le soleil et ridees.   J&#x27;utilise cette huile tous les jours et j&#x27;en suis tres satisfaite.  Bien cordialement.  blanche Hay</li>
            <li> I have been to Morocco and have seen how this oil is made first hand.  It is a painstaking process, all done manually. My grandmother used to use it for everything from cooking to beauty!  I don&#x27;t think it tastes good but it&#x27;s great for your skin and your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a smell or residue.  My hair has regained it healthy boucing curls!  A little goes a long way, I used it after I towel dry my hair and when I feel my ends need it. Good value for the amount you get and no junk mixed in.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is superb quality! The customer service is efficient and friendly too! I use this product every day morning and night and at 31 yrs old I am soooo glad I found Argan oil now vs. later! Thank you, \\&quot;Slice of Nature\\&quot; for a great prodact at a great price!</li>
            <li> I had purchased the 2 oz. 100% Pure Virgin Argan Oil about four months ago and I have to say it is by far one of the best oils I had ever used on my hair and skin. I have very oily skin and always had very bad acne also on my back. I sprayed three drops in my hand and massage it on my face. Within five minutes, my face still looked oily. Based upon the reviews some people stated it dissipates quickly within the skin but there is a twist. The next day, my acne on my face grew larger and then, it went away the next day. By the end of the week, it was completely gone. Also, my acne scars were noticeably lighter. I used Proactiv for two years and it made my skin darker.    Wait there is more. I have very thick full hair which passes my shoulders about three inches. After using the Argan Oil on my scalp and hair it grew 3x&#x27;s faster within three months. I had never seen my hair grow out that fast. After I ran out of Argan Oil I used 100% Pure Cold Pressed Olive Oil. It made my hair stay moisturized. Argan Oil was my first choice as being the best and Olive Oil came second. I decided to put Argan Oil in my hair products and continue to use two drops per week. Not to mention my skin as well. I will continue to use Olive Oil on my scalp and hair after I wash it. I have received many compliments on how luscious and long my hair look.     Before, I used the 100% Pure Virgin Argan Oil I was using Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask I bought from Folica. The ingredients are Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Linseed (Linum Usitatissimum) Extract, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Chloride, Argania Spinoza Kernel Oil (Aragan Oil), Cetrimonium Chloride, Methylparaben, Fragrance (Supplement), Butylphenyl Methyloropional, and Coumarin. It did make my hair a little shiner, less frizz, and more control over it. Within several months, it broke off a lot of my hair as well. I spent too much money on different hair products and hair oils only to get burned in the end. Now, my search is over! Sliceof Nature Virgin 100% Raw Organic Argan Oil is a product I will continue to buy. The fact that Organic products is best for your hair is a plus!</li>
            <li> I live in SoCal and when ever the Santa Ana winds come or we have that kind of dry condition-my skin welts up and rashes.  I recently bought some Shea butter and this Argan oil and it soothes my skin - no rashing and dry skin peeling off.  Also, I really like how this smooths my curly hair for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.  Has a bit of scent but goes away quickly and I don&#x27;t even notice it.  This is the Shea butter I&#x27;m using along with the Argan oil.[[ASIN:B000GRENPA 100% Unrefined Certified Grade A Shea Butter 4 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my face for the past month. So far my skin has been looking more youthful and my acne has gotten better. I even think it is helping to reduce the scars and lines on my face already. I cant all out give it five starts yet it is too soon, but so far so good with this product. It may really be the beauty secret that people claim it to be!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple weeks ago from this seller.  I was mid-horrible breakout caused by an anti-aging product (with the initials OoO lol) which resulted in painful cystic acne.  I am 43 years old so I was not thrilled by that and looking for natural repairs for that as well as help for my dry and sensitive skin issues.  I had been doing a lot of research into argan oil and this seller has a great price and good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to say that this product has not only vastly softened and smoothed my very dry skin, it does so without need of a regular daily moisturizer.  I put it on twice a day, just as I used to with my moisturizer.  It has been doing a wonderful job of clearing up what was a total disaster, my entire face was terribly broken out from that previous product, and now it is almost entirely gone.  It absorbs fully into my skin and very quickly so it does not interfere with my makeup regime.  This product is working *so* well for me that I have finally convinced my fiance (a man&#x27;s man lol) to use it on his rosacea and he is very pleased with the reduced redness and bettered condition of HIS skin in only a week&#x27;s use.  Meanwhile my cuticles and nailbeds are looking better than they ever have, because after I put it on my face, I rub the excess into my nails. I use solar oil on my nails which I love but I often forget, so it&#x27;s nice to have an all-in-one product where I can take care of everything at the same time LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elbows: usually use baby oil, which works for about 12 hours.  Now I use argan oil which lasts from shower to shower and is definitely improving the former ashy-ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am learning to use it on my hair, which is in pretty good condition, but also prone to dryness, so I don&#x27;t have a full report on that yet, but I do see vast improvement in the lack of tangles when combing my wet hair after a shower.  That means even shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip it out because I put it on after the shower, not before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very little of this product goes a very long way, and I bought the small bottle.  Next time I will buy the larger size and split it up for me and my fiance.  My package arrived in perfect condition, with no leakage.  Yes, the label does look like it came from a personal printer, but I consider that to be no problem considering the product works so well.  :)product goes a very long way, and I bought the small bottle.

            <li> This is an amazing skin product! I have bought the Josie Maran Argan Oil but although it absorbs quicker than the Raw Organic Oil, it&#x27;s absolutely overpriced. Slice of Nature is absolutely amazing.  It has a very faint scent that will go away in 1 minute, and the oil will be absorbed in one minute as well.  My face feels hydrated w/out the need for reapplication.  Slice of Nature has very fast shipping and they are completely reliable.  I will reorder again from them!  They are trust-worthy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this oil, it is one of the best thing nature have to offer,i use it as a facial moisturizer in the morning and at night, your face will feel so soft and trust me it will even out your complexion,take care of your blemishes , this is a miracle oil. another product to check out is the African black soap. combine these two product together and you will not regret it. jus give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have used this product faithfully and the result is: nothing. I see no change, no result. I am beginning to think that argan oil is a hype. I&#x27;ve seen the rave reviews and am somewhat skeptical about them. Is it possible that some of those reviews are from people who just want to believe that  the oil is doing great things for them. There are 2 of us using the oil and neither one of us sees any result.</li>
            <li> This has been the best thing I have ever used to soften the dry patches on my arm and it absorbs extremely well, but I bought this argan oil specifically to use on my face. I was hoping that it would help with my acne, dullness, and smile lines. I have oily skin, which isn&#x27;t too bad during the cooler seasons, but trying this out in the summer was a bad idea -- although it didn&#x27;t make my face much shinier than usual nor did it break me out, it did feel heavy and oily on my face. Mixing about 4-5 drops with my regular gel moisturizer and only using it at night helped with this. After using for over a month, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s been much help with the acne (I&#x27;ve been using other products for this as well) and smile lines, but my face does have a nice glow and I&#x27;m hoping that it will delay future aging lines. Even though it&#x27;s only 2oz, you only need to use a little bit at a time so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I asked them if they have organic certificate and about weight of product - couple days ago it showed 2 oz, but really it is 1.7 oz (http://www.amazon.com/review/RT19FZ917BYSD/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B002V7968C&amp;nodeID&#x3D;#wasThisHelpful )  They ignored my questions, but change the size of bottle on the site - now it is showing how it is in truth..  How come you, slice of nature, can be so disrespectful to customers???    Again: you say u have a certificate that your argan oil is organic. Can we see it???</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  The smell is very faint and disappears very quickly.  The product is a very light oil that even I (with oily skin) can use on my face - it absorbs immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue.  It also transformed my thin, somewhat wavy hair into the one full of body and waves!  I leave the oil on my hair for an hour or so before washing... haven&#x27;t tried it as a leave-in yet...  Love it... the bottle did leak during shipping and smeared the packaging but the bottle was full when arrived (must&#x27;ve been a tiny leak).  Highly recommend.. I&#x27;m getting more for Mother&#x27;s Day...</li>
            <li> Just received this and it smells like olive oil. True argan oil is not supposed to have this scent.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that there is no added fragrance, just the natural argan fruit, which is so mild that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I have used it only for a couple of days in addition to my regular routine and it&#x27;s fine. The spray/dropper works like a charm giving you just the right amount in one shot.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product really is great. I have been using the Slice of Nature Argan Oil for about a week.  I now live in AZ and my skin is dry and gets red flaky patches.  I have been using the oil twice a day under a light moisturizer. I don&#x27;t even wait for it to absorb before I apply my moisturizer. Then it all sinks right into the skin in a just few minutes. Then my face feels so silky smooth that I keep touching it. Not greasy AT ALL. I was using all kinds of products and just felt saturated with creams and potions, yuk.     When I wake up in the morning my face is soft and glowy. It took a few days but all my dry red patches are gone! I also have acne prone skin and have not had any break out problems with the oil. You won&#x27;t be sorry with this Argan Oil. Try It! I won&#x27;t be without it.     I really liked Slice of Natures&#x27;s info on the Argan Oils.  It helped me make my decision to buy their brand. It does have that Argan smell (which really isn&#x27;t that bad), but that goes away really quick. Only thing is that I wish it came with a dropper.</li>
            <li> I have been learning a lot about Argan and have found the following to be accurate.  First, they do seem to be a nice company and were easy to deal with.  However, their oil is not of high quality.  The following is what I received from a very reputable seller on Ebay. I received the oil and am much more pleased with the quailty and results.  \\&quot;A strong odor can have many causes. Some have likened a strong odor to producers failing to be selective in harvesting the fruit, resulting in a strong goat-like odor, or oil can become old. It is commonly known in Morocco that, in some locations, goats climb the argan tree and eat the fruit. Our producer does not select fruit that has been eaten in this way. Another way that an odor occurs is by the producer roasting the seed prior to extracting the oil. This extracted oil results in a strong roasted nutty odor and is used primarily for culinary purposes- and the taste is quite good. Moroccan people are also accustomed to using oil from roasted kernels for skin and hair. Filtering can have something to do with an unpleasant odor. If too much of the kernel is left in the oil, it can degrade more quickly, resulting in an unpleasant odor.\\&quot;  This seller also included a brochure about their Eccocert Organic Fair Trade certification.  Their ID is: lgdpeddler and they call their store The Posh Peddler.  I would recommend trying this oil before giving up on Argan oil.</li>
            <li> First time purchase of Argan Oil, and after having read all the great reviews about its benefits, I decided to purchase this one by &#x27;Slice of Nature&#x27;.  Oil is very thick and concentrated, so a little goes a long way. There is a slight nutty smell (not a bad smell), but it quickly goes away within a few minutes after applying.  I decided to try another brand as I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a good quality oil, and after trying this &#x27;other&#x27; brand I quickly realized how much BETTER quality &#x27;Slice of Natures\\&quot; is!!!  My skin is very moisturized using this from head to toes- and a teeny tiny bit rubbed into my damp hair gives a great shine. No break outs from using this &amp; I would definitely re-purchase this oil and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> When I first bought this I gave it a good review. Then I found out the reason argan oil will smell like poop, as this product does, is because goats eat the nuts, pass them, then they are collected and used to make oil. Wasted my money on an impure product.</li>
            <li> It would have been 5 stars if the applicator worked better. Still a very good product</li>
