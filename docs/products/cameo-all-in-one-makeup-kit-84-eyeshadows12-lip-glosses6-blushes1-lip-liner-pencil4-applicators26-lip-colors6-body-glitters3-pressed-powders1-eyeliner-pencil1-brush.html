            <li>the product is just like in the photo, it´s really beautiful but was not wrapped or protected by anything during shipment</li>
            <li>Happy 11th birthday to me.</li>
            <li>Not that great quality</li>
            <li>Good buy- great variety.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice though</li>
            <li>I like to add more items</li>
            <li>If you want more color, spritz your application tool with a bit of water to pick up more of that pigment and layer the color on.</li>
            <li>I was so excited and anticipated the moment it would arrive all week!</li>
            <li>The makeup is great, everything you need in one box, very professional looking.</li>
            <li>The product seems fine</li>
            <li>Big and great for books and binders.</li>
            <li>There are So many different colors and a good variety of choices.</li>
            <li>This kit is great to take with me when I&#x27;m doing makeup on other people, and for myself.</li>
            <li>When it got dropped off my face lit up and I quickly unwrapped it.</li>
            <li>Some of the eyeshadows may not be super pigmented, but kits like this are meant to have build-able color</li>
            <li>It was worth the money.</li>
            <li>should definitely pack it better.</li>
            <li>We were pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The body glitters stayed on really well all through my night of hard partying, and the lipgloss colors are really pretty too.</li>
            <li>I bought this a while back when I was young for my birthday.</li>

            <li> Buy it! this product deserves 5 million stars!! If I could give it that it would be with no hesitation! Buy it... Yes!!!</li>
            <li> We were pleasantly surprised. It was worth the money. There are So many different colors and a good variety of choices.</li>
            <li> Good buy- great variety.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back when I was young for my birthday. I was so excited and anticipated the moment it would arrive all week! When it got dropped off my face lit up and I quickly unwrapped it. The disappointment on my face must have been heart breaking. Everything was crushed and broken. I cried because of the money I wasted and the worthless result of my birthday money. Contacted Amazon and nothing happened. Happy 11th birthday to me. 3 years later it still dissapoints me</li>
            <li> it was completely broken and al the powder and blushes were also broken.. all the slots are broken and are empty as all the powder oozed out</li>
            <li> The plastic case was cracked along the back by the mirror and the hinge was broken. The product seems fine but it looked like it was packed broken.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t not buy this it sucks it broke when I got it and it sucks really bad don&#x27;t not get its a wast of money.</li>
            <li> Box was broken, and some makeup</li>
            <li> I like to add more items</li>
            <li> I rated it the product, not the shipment. The makeup is great, everything you need in one box, very professional looking. I however returned it because it was wrapped in an envelop which means it made it to my house in a million pieces. That was upsetting because I truly wanted to keep this. Again, I rated the product not the way I received it.</li>
            <li> I actually returned this because it was partially damage on arrival. Nice though</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the product and packaging. One side of the makeup box was broken into pieces and there was powder everywhere. I tried to contact the seller but they did not respond. Waste of time and money. I will return it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;g know if it has beenreceived, is a gift routing to Puerto Rico.  As soon as I have a word from the personI sent this gift I will let you know.</li>
            <li> This kit is great to take with me when I&#x27;m doing makeup on other people, and for myself. Some of the eyeshadows may not be super pigmented, but kits like this are meant to have build-able color so you an achieve millions of different looks. If you want more color, spritz your application tool with a bit of water to pick up more of that pigment and layer the color on. The body glitters stayed on really well all through my night of hard partying, and the lipgloss colors are really pretty too.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Big and great for books and binders. It ripped after 2 months. Not that great quality</li>
            <li> the product is just like in the photo, it´s really beautiful but was not wrapped or protected by anything during shipment so when I finally received it the product had some of the black plastic parts broken. should definitely pack it better.</li>
