            <li>This has been my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume for 12 years, since I first bought her a bottle at Nordstroms.  </li>
            <li>There is the original version which has</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still beautiful smelling but something had changed about it a few years ago.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but unique which makes it worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see the how the price had increased since I last purchased it</li>

            <li> Beautiful fragrance in a beautiful bottle. Ladies, if you want to smell different than anyone else, buy this perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Met my expectations</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice perfume, and I love the price!</li>
            <li> Bought Boudoir parfum, excellent packaging, fast delivery, will definetely order again, thanks</li>
            <li> Simply one of the best fragrances ever.  People always ask me what I am wearing  and where can they buy it, particularly men want to know for their wives and girlfriends!  Great testament to Boudior....very hard to get though.  Her other fragrances aren&#x27;t like it at all.  She should make it again!</li>
            <li> The provider met my every expectation. The perfume was very well packed and it arrived exactly on time. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s Boudoir I get compliments from men and women.  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere locally anymore so I was really excited when I found it on Amazon.com.  This was my first purchase on this site and I am very happy with the process.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this fragrance a few years ago and happened to find a bottle under my bathroom sink and thought I&#x27;d give it a try for old times sake not knowing if it still was at it&#x27;s best.After two hours at a party five people had asked me what fragrance I was wearing.I&#x27;d describe it as sexy with a musky middle note.I would probably wear it as a night time fragrance as it is quite complex but it really smells very very good and both women and men seem to love it. I was surprised to see the how the price had increased since I last purchased it but I think it is well worth it and if you like it you will grow to love it very quickly.</li>
            <li> Boudoir is a beautiful fragrance.  Soft and sexy.</li>
            <li> This has been my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume for 12 years, since I first bought her a bottle at Nordstroms.  Nothing else like it -- biggest problems is it&#x27;s so hard to find.  Thanks to Amazon and their third party network, it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> No no no, fake perfume... In my opinion. Smell good just for about an hour.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! great smell!!</li>
            <li> Ever since I first smelled Boudoir I was hooked. It&#x27;s expensive, but unique which makes it worth the money. I think they might have changed the formula though. It&#x27;s still beautiful smelling but something had changed about it a few years ago. It was better then, but still beautiful now.</li>
            <li> I was afraid before I got this perfume how good quality it would be. I am quite satisfied with it. My respect to the seller and amazon as well. The quality it good. Safely delivered and the smell is sustainable. I sprinkled several hour before and still smell is felt</li>
            <li> AZ perfume did an excellent job with the packaging and shipping. The perfume smells beautiful and sexy.</li>
            <li> This perfume make me feel so lovely. People always tell how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Great find, great service.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent price!!!</li>
            <li> oh gosh, this perfume makes me feel glamorous when i wear it. it smells like old money.</li>
            <li> Boudoir has been my signature scent for years. I get plenty of compliments from men and women alike. It&#x27;s an exciting, sensual, powdery, scent with floral undertones. There is the original version which has a dark pink (almost brownish/orange at times), and then a later version which is light pink appearing more pastel in color. The difference in smell and wearability is night/day in my opinion. The original is a sensual, lingering, pleasant, longer-lasting scent. Whereas, the later version is powdery, short-lived, with undertones of grasses/herbs rather than florals which sent my allergies into a talespin! No matter which version, Boudoir is definitely not for everyone. You either love it or you hate it - there is no in between. Before you decide to get hooked on it - remember, the perfume has been discontinued and is VERY hard to find, and price will vary drastically.</li>
