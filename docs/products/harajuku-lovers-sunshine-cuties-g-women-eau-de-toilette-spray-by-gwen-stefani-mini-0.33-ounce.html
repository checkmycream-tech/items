            <li>This scent is more on the woodsy side.  </li>
            <li>Test them, find your scent, and enjoy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the best scent of the Sunshine Cuties collection.  </li>
            <li>G is my favorite out of the collection.  </li>
            <li>Really adorable figurine that smells actually pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I find it refreshing and light.</li>

            <li>It is pretty soft and sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>I normally wear G throughout the year, but this sunshine cuties G offers such a refreshing twist!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like the real I bought before, and there is no logo in the area where I push.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is discontinued or what, but Amazon is pretty much the last place that carries this particular perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>considering the department stores do not offer deals very often (the free bag; so not worth it).</li>
            <li>not too old fashioned or pungent.</li>
            <li>In all honesty the smell straight from the bottle and the smell on your skin are two very different smells.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it is a fake!</li>

            <li> It is difficult to find these in store.</li>
            <li> I was very sad to see that Nordstrom didn&#x27;t carry it anymore.  </li>

            <li> Great scent for summer, makes you feel you are in a resort! Very light and coco-nutty.  Cute bottle too, I had the original G and the \\&quot;winter bunnies\\&quot; version, I love them all.  And, this is a small enough bottle that you don&#x27;t feel like you have a long time commitment when you get it ;)</li>
            <li> Smells great arrived quick</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure it is a fake! It doesn&#x27;t smell like the real I bought before, and there is no logo in the area where I push. I will never buy it again!!!!!</li>
            <li> This little cutie pie made the G collection complete and up to date. Always looking forward to the next fragrance and bottle. I love everything from this line.</li>
            <li> I normally wear G throughout the year, but this sunshine cuties G offers such a refreshing twist! I ordered it a little late in the summer but it arrived surprisingly fast! (Sooner than the projected arrival dates). The perfume was well-packaged and I have absolutely no complaints! I&#x27;d definitely order it again!</li>
            <li> I fell in with this scent the moment it wafted its way into my nostrils. Its a playful perfume perfect for summer and everyday use.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I was able to get it for a lower price than I would at a department store. Shipping was pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> I will never get enough of this scent. EVER. &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume.  Favorite among all my daughters and myself.  Has a  sweet smell, and adorable jar.  Collect all of them.1</li>
            <li> Smells like a tropical vacation. Happy bright sweet and yumi. Great for gifts, teens too! not too old fashioned or pungent.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for the bottle and when it arrive it was cuter than expected and the perfume smells amazing! I&#x27;m not much of a perfume wearer but this is one that I will actually wear!</li>
            <li> I love the scent! The only thing is the bottle is really small. I wish they had a bigger size. Anyone who loves coconut and vanilla should definitely add this scent to their collection.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this fragrance and will be disappointed when I can no longer find it!!</li>
            <li> I see so many reviews stating how gross a perfume smells.  In all honesty the smell straight from the bottle and the smell on your skin are two very different smells.  Some advise, go to the big department stores and spray away!  It is free and you have so many to choose from!  Do not feel obligated to buy at the perfume counter considering the department stores do not offer deals very often (the free bag; so not worth it). When you find out what smells like something you would wear come back to amazon.com and buy it! Everyone likes something different so for someone to not buy a product just because someone else says it is gross is perfume discrimination (LOL)!    This scent is more on the woodsy side.  I find it refreshing and light. But I went to the mall and tested it out before I bought it! The bottles have cute little toppers to make it more eye catching.     Test them, find your scent, and enjoy!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend was pleased - very light scent smells amazing. Will be a purchase for the future, has a summer aroma.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells great! The bottle arrived naked but the merchant is allowing me to keep the perfume and get a refund. They did respond quickly to correct the problem. The plus side is my teenage niece loves the perfume.</li>
            <li> This perfume is getting harder and harder to findâ€” and where I can find it, it&#x27;s super expensive! I don&#x27;t know if this is discontinued or what, but Amazon is pretty much the last place that carries this particular perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my mom&#x27;s go-to perfume on a day to day basis. She loves it, so I&#x27;m happy to be able to find it on here for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for the actual scent? It is pretty soft and sweet smelling. A little bit coconut-y.</li>
            <li> IT smells great and lasts a really long time. I had it for a year and have just used it up. Smells amazing. IT smells tropical and fruity, not your typical perfume.</li>
            <li> Really adorable figurine that smells actually pretty good.  It&#x27;s definitely the best scent of the Sunshine Cuties collection.  Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Harajuku lovers is my go to fragrance.  I was very sad to see that Nordstrom didn&#x27;t carry it anymore.  G is my favorite out of the collection.  However when I received this bottle it didn&#x27;t smell the same.  Major disappointment on my part. Not exactly sure why there was a difference.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find these in store. Very cute and great to give as gifts</li>
            <li> very nice scent and love the bottle.  It makes a great holiday of Christmas gift and I love collecting the different bottles.</li>
