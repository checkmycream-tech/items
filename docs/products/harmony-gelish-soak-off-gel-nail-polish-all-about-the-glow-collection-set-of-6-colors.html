            <li>I love all of these colours.</li>
            <li>After receiving the order I looked in the box too make sure all six bottles were there and then wrapped them up.</li>
            <li>After another 2 weeks and one more attempt, they stated they don&#x27;t know whats going on.</li>
            <li>I wear this collection as a different color on each finger and it is so fun, bright, and awesome</li>
            <li>and I love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this collection.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to receive my items way before estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>The colors are all bright and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I apply a coat of white under bright colours to make them pop even more.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and I&#x27;m sure they will cure fine.</li>
            <li>They are in fact a lot brighter than the picture shows, but I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>So fun!</li>
            <li>love this very long lasting and colors really awesome</li>
            <li>These colors are bright and with 3 coats, very solid.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m older and never would have thought that I&#x27;d like neon polish for myself, but this Gelish collection has changed my mind.</li>
            <li>The black box picture makes &amp;#34;You Glare, I Glow&amp;#34; look very blue, when in fact it&#x27;s more of a neon purple.</li>
            <li>green (Sometimes A Girl&#x27;s Gotta Glow) and the coral (I&#x27;m Brighter than You) are both a little thin and streaky and need at least three coats for full coverage, but the other four have the perfect consistency and full coverage with two coats.</li>
            <li>Fun colors but a little too neon for me.</li>
            <li>The first color I used, I had a few girls from work</li>

            <li> Great colors, love them!</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are awesome and they threw in free cuticle oil. It seemed like they took a while to get here (the full 7 days :() but thats because I was checking to see if they&#x27;re here every day.  The bottles are the bigger ones so you&#x27;re getting a really good deal on the nail polish.</li>
            <li> Great product and fun set of colors!</li>
            <li> I love all of these colours. I apply a coat of white under bright colours to make them pop even more.</li>
            <li> All about the glow was the first collection I bought. I loved the colors shown, but when I actually recieved them I was amazed. They are in fact a lot brighter than the picture shows, but I am not disappointed at all. I love how bright they are! The first color I used, I had a few girls from work ask me where I got my nails done and what that color was. I think they were shocked that I do my nails myself. I think buying the gelish polish and doing them myself saves so much time and money. I will never buy another brand of gel polish. Gelish is the best!</li>
            <li> What a dissapointment. Do not buy from Beauty Shine. They don&#x27;t take returns. Unless you don&#x27;t care about the color shades you are getting, and care all about the quality of the gel nail polish, go ahead and buy. I give this 2 stars because i feel i was mislead about what i was purchasing. In the picture, the royal blue color called \\&quot;you glare i glow\\&quot; is NOT blue, IT IS NEON PURPLE. None of the colors match the picture. Please remove the picture and post accurate color matches please!!!!</li>
            <li> So fun! Perfect for summer!  Nice for the pool and nice for going out.  I get compliments whenever I wear these.</li>
            <li> This polished peeled, was too thick, the set had all the wrong colors (brown, black, egg plant purple, an unsightly grey). This sucked....</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for an anniversary present for my wife. After receiving the order I looked in the box too make sure all six bottles were there and then wrapped them up. After my wife opened them, she noticed that a couple of the bottles were the same color. I contacted the seller to exchange, which they said would not be an issue. After a couple weeks of nothing I contacted them again and they said they don&#x27;t know what happened but they would check the post office. After another 2 weeks and one more attempt, they stated they don&#x27;t know whats going on. The fact that they said they would exchange the bottles and then proceed to give me the run around is the reason I give them one star</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and I&#x27;m sure they will cure fine. I would look at the photo with the white background, not the photo of all the polishes in a black box. The black box picture makes &amp;#34;You Glare, I Glow&amp;#34; look very blue, when in fact it&#x27;s more of a neon purple.</li>
            <li> These colors are bright and with 3 coats, very solid.  I&#x27;m looking forward to using them on their own and under other colors.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand and it stays on for a few weeks without chipping.  I love this brand and would recommend it for home or professional use.</li>
            <li> Best gel, gelish delivers a very good quality gel, not cheap but worth it</li>
            <li> I wear this collection as a different color on each finger and it is so fun, bright, and awesome I get compliments all the time! People say that it looks like I have SKITTLES on my nails :D I also use IBD just Gel &amp;#34;Infinitely Curious&amp;#34; Orange and Perfect Match &amp;#34;Happy Hour&amp;#34; Yellow with this collection and I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;*The picture shown for this item makes one of the polishes look BLUE but it is actually purple. The best purple gel polish I have found! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this collection.  The colors are all bright and vibrant.  I&#x27;m older and never would have thought that I&#x27;d like neon polish for myself, but this Gelish collection has changed my mind. I like the purple - You Glare, I Glow the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green (Sometimes A Girl&#x27;s Gotta Glow) and the coral (I&#x27;m Brighter than You) are both a little thin and streaky and need at least three coats for full coverage, but the other four have the perfect consistency and full coverage with two coats.</li>
            <li> Fun colors but a little too neon for me.</li>
            <li> love this very long lasting and colors really awesome</li>
            <li> Very good product, great different colors. Good service. Perfect fore me and my nails. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and matched description</li>
            <li> I was pleased to receive my items way before estimated delivery date. However, none of the 6 colors I received were even close to the colors I ordered. And 2 of the 6 were the same color. A tad disappointed.</li>
