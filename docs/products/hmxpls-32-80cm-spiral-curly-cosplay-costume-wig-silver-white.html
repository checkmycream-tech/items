            <li>and I was somehow able to get it covered by the wig so that you can&#x27;t see it at all.</li>
            <li>Fantastic quality!</li>
            <li>The earliest estimated delivery date was October 24th, but it came in October 8th :)</li>
            <li>It surprisingly covers my real hair well too!</li>
            <li>It combs easily and still kept the wave without loosing a bunch of strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The color is really a beautiful silver-white (not off white</li>

            <li>Price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised of how good the wig was.</li>
            <li>Check the stitching to make sure all wefts are sewn in right.</li>
            <li>love it, I think this is my new favorite cosplay</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to order two ;)</li>
            <li>Super soft wig, much better quality than I was expecting, I could finger-comb through the curls, and they retained most of their shape.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful for a couple different occasions but it tangles fast and frizzes up.</li>
            <li>And, Im sure I will buy more wigs from them in different styles.  </li>
            <li>fast and easy..</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit very well.</li>
            <li>It also came with a hair net and the wig seems to be fairly nice quality.</li>
            <li>but its worth 10$</li>
            <li>well mine was the right color</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much darker though I bought it for a more natural looking Felicia hardy cosplay!</li>
            <li>This wig is really nice, but it takes a very VERY long time to ship.  </li>
            <li>The hair is soft and not too synthetic (plastic) feeling, and parts easily-</li>
            <li>Overall, this is an excellent buy for only ten bucks!</li>
            <li>Other reviewers are right that after a while, it can get tangled, but for the most part, it works super well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for the bride to wear to her bachelorette party because I was under the impression that it was white; it&#x27;s most certainly gray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good wig overall but NOT white or silver.</li>
            <li>It is quite lovely and long though.</li>
            <li>Good for people with small heads.</li>
            <li>The wig arrived earlier than I had expected, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>This wig was perfect alil too long but worth it it does get tangled after a few minutes without proper care</li>
            <li>longer and much better quality than I expected for the price</li>
            <li>It came with a hair net and straps that help it say on secure.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to keep an eye on it because it was a tangled mess at the end of the day</li>
            <li>other than that, it arrive way faster than expected, and the quality is good.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely come to them first when in need of a wig!</li>
            <li>I bought Silver White for my Storm costume, the color is exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>Make sure you order it a few months before you need it.</li>
            <li>This wig was full and long with lots of curls.</li>
            <li>I ordered more than 1 month in advance, and it came just a few days before Halloween.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit tight trying to fit my real hair under it all, but it can be done.</li>
            <li>like I was afraid of getting) and the wig is nice and full.</li>
            <li>The weight of the hair and the silkiness makes it hard to hold with bobby pins, so I will have to invest in better hair clips if I want to style it.</li>
            <li>I wore it for 6+ hours, and barely noticed it was on.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping it took about a week and a half</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because to me, the wig looks grey in real life, not nearly as white as in the picture.</li>
            <li>I ironed it with a flat iron to straighten it and have dyed it with rit dye so far and its held up to the heat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s old lady grey bluish.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is of medium thickness and almost two feet long</li>
            <li>As in an old woman&#x27;s grey.</li>
            <li>Wig wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;silver white&amp;#34; it was more &amp;#34;silver grey&amp;#34; which is disappointing, because I bought it for a white unicorn costume I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>

            <li> the bangs are long enough to style and pin back if desired.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and curly, but it&#x27;s pretty thin.</li>
            <li> The wig is very thin on top and the hair is not soft.</li>
            <li> I would just advise people who are looking for a wig that isn&#x27;t grey, not to expect this one to look white.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one like this for a long time to use for different costumes.</li>
            <li> This wig goes to the middle of my torso, so it&#x27;s very long.</li>
            <li> The color of the hair is not silver/white as described, anticipated and pictured, it&#x27;s in fact grey.</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft with a natural shine and doesn&#x27;t look too fake.</li>
            <li> The curls are tight, but I think if I stretch them, the hair will be as long as depicted.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;m combining 2 wigs into one (removing the wefts from one wig and sewing them between the wefts of the other wig to make it fuller.  </li>
            <li> A few of mine were loose.</li>
            <li> Thick and the hairs do not fall out which is a +.</li>
            <li> Thick hair no bald spots.</li>
            <li> It was to thin showed the cap I did not like at all</li>
            <li> Thin wig.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t hide my thick hair and looks very unrealistic</li>
            <li> So that was rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> but so disappointed it&#x27;s thin and bangs are all wrong terrible not what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Horrible!!</li>

            <li> Top notch! Looks great on.. i will buy more from this seller. They shipped it sooner than the estimate time Amazon indicated.</li>
            <li> Horrible!! It was to thin showed the cap I did not like at all</li>
            <li> This is a great wig for the price. The hair is soft and not too synthetic (plastic) feeling, and parts easily- the bangs are long enough to style and pin back if desired. The curls are tight, but I think if I stretch them, the hair will be as long as depicted. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because to me, the wig looks grey in real life, not nearly as white as in the picture. I&#x27;m not heartbroken over it or anything though. I would just advise people who are looking for a wig that isn&#x27;t grey, not to expect this one to look white.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to get to me...but it was worth the wait! The color is really a beautiful silver-white (not off white like I was afraid of getting) and the wig is nice and full. It combs easily and still kept the wave without loosing a bunch of strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, I think this is my new favorite cosplay wig!...no, I know it is!</li>
            <li> The wig arrived earlier than I had expected, which was a pleasant surprise. It also came with a hair net and the wig seems to be fairly nice quality. I like it. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> longer and much better quality than I expected for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wig overall but NOT white or silver. It&#x27;s old lady grey bluish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful but it&#x27;s definitely not white! I bought this for the bride to wear to her bachelorette party because I was under the impression that it was white; it&#x27;s most certainly gray. It is quite lovely and long though.</li>
            <li> This wig is really nice, but it takes a very VERY long time to ship.  Make sure you order it a few months before you need it.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping it took about a week and a half I believe the quality of the wig is amazing I bought the silver white it&#x27;s much darker though I bought it for a more natural looking Felicia hardy cosplay! Definetly love this wig</li>
            <li> This is wear around town quality hair... I was surprised of how good the wig was. I intended on only wearing this when my son and i did videos, but i might wear this wig out . It looks amazing. And, Im sure I will buy more wigs from them in different styles.  Great quality. Great Price.  Comes with a skullcap to hold the wig on better which was really nice, as i forgot to order some.</li>
            <li> Wig wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;silver white&amp;#34; it was more &amp;#34;silver grey&amp;#34; which is disappointing, because I bought it for a white unicorn costume I&#x27;m wearing.  Oh well, I&#x27;ll make it work!  other than that, it arrive way faster than expected, and the quality is good.  I bought three of them.  One is for my tial.  Then I&#x27;m combining 2 wigs into one (removing the wefts from one wig and sewing them between the wefts of the other wig to make it fuller.  I&#x27;ll post my photo results when I finish!</li>

            <li> This is a gorgeous wig! I have been wanting one like this for a long time to use for different costumes. It&#x27;s perfect for Galadriel, Daenerys Targaryen, and all of my Elvish cosplays. The hair is very soft with a natural shine and doesn&#x27;t look too fake. It surprisingly covers my real hair well too! My natural hair is of medium thickness and almost two feet long and I was somehow able to get it covered by the wig so that you can&#x27;t see it at all. It was a bit tight trying to fit my real hair under it all, but it can be done. This wig goes to the middle of my torso, so it&#x27;s very long. The curls are nice and keep their shape well, although they get tangled a bit easily. The weight of the hair and the silkiness makes it hard to hold with bobby pins, so I will have to invest in better hair clips if I want to style it. Overall, this is an excellent buy for only ten bucks! It arrived within two days with Amazon Prime and comes with a wig cap.</li>
            <li> This wig was perfect alil too long but worth it it does get tangled after a few minutes without proper care but i made it nappy and Tangled for a Ursula the sea witch cosplay ,did take foreve to Get here but its worth 10$ maybe im buying a blonde one soon</li>
            <li> Our daughter order this wig to go along with her costume.  She seemed very pleased.</li>
            <li> The color of the hair is not silver/white as described, anticipated and pictured, it&#x27;s in fact grey. As in an old woman&#x27;s grey. Not useable at all for my purpose. So that was rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> Its a truely amazing wig, My cosplayer sister love it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit very well. Good for people with small heads.</li>
            <li> fast and easy..great product:)</li>
            <li> Not as curly has the picture. Thick and the hairs do not fall out which is a +.</li>
            <li> I like the silver white wig I wore it for Halloween. I was happy with the way it looked on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;patt blondell</li>
            <li> Super soft wig, much better quality than I was expecting, I could finger-comb through the curls, and they retained most of their shape. I wore it for 6+ hours, and barely noticed it was on. Not scratchy, not over-shiny. All in all, AMAZING for the price.</li>
            <li> This is nothing like what is described. The wig is very thin on top and the hair is not soft. I will not be buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality! Was a wonderful accessory to my Halloween costume!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome wig. I got the Silver White Color to use for a vampire costume for Halloween.  This wig was full and long with lots of curls. Only took 3 weeks to get here even though it said it would take 4 to 6. It came with a hair net and straps that help it say on secure. I would definitely come to them first when in need of a wig!</li>
            <li> You can see the wig knitting at the part.  I had to spray it with why hairspray to disguise it.</li>
            <li> This wig is beautiful. So soft, great quality! LOVE!</li>
            <li> I bought Silver White for my Storm costume, the color is exactly like the picture! Another reviewer said they ordered that color and it was platinum blonde...well mine was the right color, so I guess theirs was just a mistake. It comes with a wig cap, which is nice. The hair is soft and curly, but it&#x27;s pretty thin. I cut layers into mine. Great for the price! The earliest estimated delivery date was October 24th, but it came in October 8th :)</li>
            <li> I wore this for a black cat cosplay and it was great! Just be sure to keep an eye on it because it was a tangled mess at the end of the day</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Beautiful, long wig, fairly easy to put on, and looks lovely.  Other reviewers are right that after a while, it can get tangled, but for the most part, it works super well.  I used that for a Halloween party dressed as Daenerys and it was a great hit. At the end of the night, I didn&#x27;t want to take it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Price is fantastic.  You can&#x27;t beat that.  Get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Sloooooow shipping.  I ordered more than 1 month in advance, and it came just a few days before Halloween.  So, if you are in a hurry, this is not the one to get.  To the shipper&#x27;s credit, they gave out a window of estimated delivery dates. Mine arrived 2 days into the delivery period.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful for a couple different occasions but it tangles fast and frizzes up.</li>
            <li> Wore with a halloween costume, I got so many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Thin wig. Check the stitching to make sure all wefts are sewn in right. A few of mine were loose. It was no problem for me. I ordered two wigs and cut one apart to harvest wefts to place in the second wig. Its what you&#x27;d expect out of an eight dollar wig made in china. It stands up to heat nicely. I ironed it with a flat iron to straighten it and have dyed it with rit dye so far and its held up to the heat. Definitely will order again! Just be sure to order two ;)</li>
            <li> Great price. Bought it for a Halloween costume. Thick hair no bald spots. Great price.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t hide my thick hair and looks very unrealistic</li>
