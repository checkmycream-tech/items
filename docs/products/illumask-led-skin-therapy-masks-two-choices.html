            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my skin.....</li>
            <li>I love the mask and eye mask from IlluMask.</li>
            <li>SURE YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE BUYING</li>
            <li>But, I have not yet decided if it is worthwhile continuing.</li>
            <li>I returned this product as I could not justify spending more money on a product that had done nothing it promised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if I see more results the more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll comment more in about a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say look for something better that doesn&#x27;t intentionally stop working.</li>
            <li>but love it all can see the difference</li>
            <li>I have been using my IlluMask for two weeks and also love the results.  </li>
            <li>My skin is more even in color already</li>
            <li>The freckles (okay</li>
            <li>100%&lt;br /&gt;It should come in a more durable mask that buyers can change the batteries</li>
            <li>and you have used one of the precious 30 &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered 4 more masks because I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Lines around my mouth are about 50% better and lines between my brows cleared up as well about 50%.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 30 bucks:)</li>
            <li>and it seems to work better.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using  the ialluMask Anti-Aging Mask.</li>
            <li>My face is now clearer, brighter, smoother, and MORE</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>when I finish the sessions I will be better able to rate.</li>
            <li>My skin has a much better tone and texture.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re telling me you could not put more treatments than 30 into the mask?</li>
            <li>and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>I honestly LOVE my Illumask.</li>
            <li>If this has all occurred in just 5 weeks, I can&#x27;t wait to note the difference after three more.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li>I now have smoother, firmer and more moisture.</li>
            <li>My skin is much more hydrated as well, and all around, I really LOVE this easy to use, and so inexpensive treatment.</li>
            <li>Just got it felt good for the first time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth 15 minutes a day and is way more effective than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>Works great for me thus far:</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt, doesn&#x27;t make noise, and is effortless, but I just don&#x27;t know that it is worth it and or even effective.</li>
            <li>I am excited about how much more improvement I will have as I continue to use the mask.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use too!</li>
            <li>It is easy and just 15 minutes a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about returning it unless I find an easy workaround.</li>
            <li>This mask is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>I have traveled with it and have found it easy to use because it&#x27;s portable</li>
            <li>So easy and convenient</li>
            <li>So..... easy to use, affordable price</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product on the basis of the consumer having realistic expectations and giving it a fair trial.  </li>
            <li>The mask is super easy to use and I can see a difference in about a week, and of course gets better as you use it.</li>
            <li>Well, this is a fine example of MAKE</li>
            <li>I could see the fine lines lessening on my face.</li>
            <li>softer and fuller, fine lines and wrinkles have faded as if they were plumped up and smoothed out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42 and am beginning to notice aging issues like sunspots and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Bought two of these, I&#x27;ve been a proponent of cold laser treatment for years and have experienced the wonderful benefits they offer.</li>
            <li>and I hope having my eyelids exposed to the light won&#x27;t hurt my vision.</li>
            <li>Great product, used twice a week, would purchase again at a latter date.  </li>
            <li>I have seen such a great improvement in my skin texture and brightness since using the Mask.  </li>
            <li>The IlluMask uses light therapy to combat aging skin.</li>
            <li>I have use the mask 5 times and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I really want to be able to use the skin machines I buy as many times as I want.</li>
            <li>Really works!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I feel really good about the fact that there is an easy and affordable way for me to do something to remedy the aging skin on my face, and I am enjoying the positive results!</li>
            <li>Since the Illumask requires your face to be clean and free of oils before use, I scrub my face with a diaper wipe before I use it.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and results are so quick.</li>
            <li>The product is so easy to use and the 15 minute sessions go by quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>MAKE sure you read the instructions first before you start playing with the controller and pressing on and off the power button...</li>
            <li>I have been using the IlluMask Anti-Aging Light Therapy Mask for 41 days so far, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I am 40 and my laugh lines have almost disappeared!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>that well so you will still see bright red light while you sit there for 15 minutes wasting away 15 minutes of your life.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing special about these LEDs.</li>
            <li>but it works really nicely right now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now finding I don&#x27;t need as much makeup my skin appears healthy and relaxed.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the full 30 days.</li>
            <li>I had really good skin to start with but the mask is helping me to get my glow back.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why the mask is only good for 30 times.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the price for light therapy during the winter season.</li>
            <li>The first week or two were fine.</li>
            <li>Clearer, tighter and more vibrant skin.</li>
            <li>My face looks more relaxed and vibrant.</li>
            <li>The very first mask, I got at Target.  </li>
            <li>however I thought it would soft a couple very fine lines</li>
            <li>The laser lights are good for a long time!</li>
            <li>This mask is easy to use and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>how much easier can it get!!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>and I guess it will only get better!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product would get better reviews if the usage wasn&#x27;t limited to 30 days.</li>
            <li>72 yr old woman love the product bargin at 1.00 ]</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother, softer, and has a fresh dewy look to it now.  </li>
            <li>mouth laugh lines.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>The light feels warm but not hot and it feels relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I figured what the heck right</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right,</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheaper to try this first this way than to go try it professionally somewhere else for more money.</li>
            <li>you can draw a funny face or picture on the mask with marker to be fun when you wear it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is the daily 15 minute rest to reset my mind, but I am feeling much more confident about my natural appearance.</li>
            <li>Very cheap made and can only use 30 days</li>
            <li>Has anyone purchased a device recently and been able to reset it?</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;ve rambled on enough.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>the red bulbs are sold on line and can purchase power cord and make your own red light treatment.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I have seen my skin change since the first week I started using it.  </li>
            <li>Did I notice a change the first day or two - no.  </li>
            <li>Regardless whether there is truth to the company&#x27;s statements about the LEDs losing effectiveness after 30 uses (highly suspicious), the fact that nowhere on the printed packaging or the product description does the manufacturer inform the consumer that this product is hardwired to stop working after 30 flips of the on switch!!  </li>
            <li>First I keep getting emails from the manufacturer to review this.</li>
            <li>My only advice for this product, if you are going to order it, you&#x27;d better like it, because you&#x27;re stuck with it.</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>For now, a couple things about my first time using it.</li>
            <li>I am on my second Illumask and have noticed my skin is much more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if my fine lines are better because I didn&#x27;t have to many, but there is a difference in the overall look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t do my research because I was totally unaware that the mask was only good for 30 days.  </li>
            <li>, this isn&#x27;t that, but it&#x27;s a constant and the results get better as you use it, I&#x27;d say I really started seeing a difference at week 3.</li>
            <li>The box, however, does boast that positive results may be seen after using the mask once a day for eight weeks.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I have seen positive improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>Starting on my second mask and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Even my family commented that the fine lines under my eyes were starting to fade noticeably.</li>
            <li>I have light blue eyes and have been squinting my whole life.</li>
            <li>smooth-- lotions and products seem to go a lot further or I don&#x27;t need as much as I used to.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think this did anything at all.</li>
            <li>this thing really works.</li>
            <li>We use to use this light in the dr, office were I woked, this is a cost effitive way to get the same result&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It takes longer - but the 15 minutes a day are a pleasure &amp; very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>After opening the package and inspecting the product, my wife and I realized that there are only 30 treatments available from this mask.  </li>
            <li>How much will it cost to reinitialize the mask?  </li>
            <li>The one area where I really want to see a difference is my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>I have all ready reviewed this item</li>
            <li>I have a very ruddy complexion with off/on rash from lupus.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot say this has done much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks  </li>
            <li>Thank you much.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know yet</li>
            <li>The tone of my face is very even and has a glow.  </li>
            <li>this works, really really works</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I just packed it in my suitcase in the original box, and it was no big deal at all.  </li>
            <li>Now, if only they would make a full body booth...</li>
            <li>My skin looks smoother, more radiant and my dark spots are gone.</li>
            <li>No where in the ad did it say you have to buy a new one every month!</li>
            <li>This is the new version!</li>
            <li>Since it is disposable after 30 days, you can make a new picture each time!  </li>
            <li>then you have to buy a whole new controller.</li>
            <li>I have used many costly products that have not given me the results this one has in this length of time and for much less money.  </li>
            <li>and  I can&#x27;t believe the difference particularly on my nose,  </li>
            <li>The mask broke after 22 uses, instead of the intended, already ridiculously limited for an LED light mask, 30 that it is supposed to come with.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Irina</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re never too old to deal with problem skin and this really helps zap congested pores and shrinks them.</li>
            <li>Maybe a few more months before you see changes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh, and another little fun thing for you artistic people out there...  </li>
            <li>I bought this mask to reduce dark spots and help with fine lines (lines and wrinkles are not my main concern).  </li>
            <li>I wore it every night consecutively for the entire time, right before bed.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, lay down or sit up put the mask on and push the button</li>
            <li>I am on my third mask and see a definite improvement on the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>since the ear pieces are too long for me, they make the whole mask sit further from my face, which allows the light to reach my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>Were it not that I could &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; the unit my self, I would rate the new style mask (because of the new controller) a zero ....</li>
            <li>Buy it and copy the instructions from the review on how to reset it with new batteries......</li>
            <li>I also do red light therapy at a local tanning salon for my body</li>
            <li>I am not sure why that is, but I also started using Beautifully Radiant Phytoceramides (also here on Amazon) a month and a half ago and the combination is a winner!  </li>
            <li>I found that by wiring a USB cable to the mask, the mask then worked fine plus those LEDs that should last near ten thousands of hours</li>
            <li>By Day 4 my 58 year old skin started to feel smoother!</li>
            <li>The only thing is I wasn&#x27;t aware that this mask is disposable.</li>
            <li>The results have definitely surprised me!</li>
            <li>My skin tone evened out and some of my fine lines and wrinkles have slightly smoothed out.  </li>
            <li>After 6 weeks I have noticed my fine lines , wrinkles and crows feet look softer and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Ridiculously hard to do at first but now, and with strategically arranged pillows, I am comfortable.</li>
            <li>It works, skin gets smoother, but be careful with eyes, it&#x27;s not enough coverage, I bought it in target and been using for 4 days, I felt the light is a little strong for my eyes</li>
            <li>So clearly this business model has nothing to do with LED/product effectiveness but rather to dupe uninformed consumers.</li>
            <li>Also used the acne mask to help clear up congested pores and it works too.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is the fact that I have to buy the whole mask and battery pack every time.</li>
            <li>At my mature age I knew this was not the fountain of youth by any means.</li>
            <li>So far I would say it helps with.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use and very affordable, just $1 a day.</li>
            <li>Second, that eye protection doesn&#x27;t really go over the eyes</li>
            <li>The lines in the middle of my forehead seem to be diminishing and it&#x27;s much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every lotion, cream and serum out there, but at the end of the day a product is only going to do so much for your skin.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, I have seen smoother, more even skin tone and texture without any change to my current skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I was glad to read the review on how to reset the device rather than throw it away, seems like a waste after only 30 treatments!</li>
            <li>I admit I was skeptical, but a friend uses led lights and her skin looks really good, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it&#x27;s painless.</li>
            <li>first, I thought these miniature lamps would dry me up.  </li>
            <li>I did buy my last illuMask yesterday at Walmart  and two prior to that at Walgreens as there, they were on the close-out table at half price  :-).  </li>
            <li>I noticed then looking very close into the mirror that I have dark brown rings starting under my left eye and much lighter on my right, as if I have deep pentetrated sun burns.</li>
            <li>and then the mask is no good until you purchase more treatments...</li>
            <li>But with Illumask those dark areas have faded to a light violet color, that usually only needs my regular foundation to cover now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd mask, and I must say that I absolutely love the fact that my face looks like I have just a subtle touch of airbrush on.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone has definitely evened out and a  brown spot, though not completely gone is much lighter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used twice so far.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am reading the other reviews, I see it is also much cheaper at WalMart.</li>
            <li>It did seem to help some with the puffiness, wrinkles, and bags underneath my eyes however it really didn&#x27;t perform any other miracles anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Everyday for the first 2 mos., then 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear foundation, but usually wear concealer especially around my eyes, and I do not need the concealer anymore.  </li>
            <li>My skin has been looking better, but I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s due to this mask or all the other anti-aging methods that I&#x27;ve been employing in the last few weeks.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is just too easy to use!</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first two sessions.</li>

            <li> On its own, I have seen a a very mild improvement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my skin.....</li>
            <li> I love the mask and eye mask from IlluMask.</li>
            <li> SURE YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE BUYING</li>
            <li> But, I have not yet decided if it is worthwhile continuing.</li>
            <li> I returned this product as I could not justify spending more money on a product that had done nothing it promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review if I see more results the more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll comment more in about a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say look for something better that doesn&#x27;t intentionally stop working.</li>
            <li> but love it all can see the difference</li>
            <li> I have been using my IlluMask for two weeks and also love the results.  </li>
            <li> My skin is more even in color already</li>
            <li> The freckles (okay</li>
            <li> 100%&lt;br /&gt;It should come in a more durable mask that buyers can change the batteries</li>
            <li> and you have used one of the precious 30 &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered 4 more masks because I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Lines around my mouth are about 50% better and lines between my brows cleared up as well about 50%.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 30 bucks:)</li>
            <li> and it seems to work better.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using  the ialluMask Anti-Aging Mask.</li>
            <li> My face is now clearer, brighter, smoother, and MORE</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> when I finish the sessions I will be better able to rate.</li>
            <li> My skin has a much better tone and texture.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re telling me you could not put more treatments than 30 into the mask?</li>
            <li> and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> I honestly LOVE my Illumask.</li>
            <li> If this has all occurred in just 5 weeks, I can&#x27;t wait to note the difference after three more.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li> I now have smoother, firmer and more moisture.</li>
            <li> My skin is much more hydrated as well, and all around, I really LOVE this easy to use, and so inexpensive treatment.</li>
            <li> Just got it felt good for the first time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worth 15 minutes a day and is way more effective than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Works great for me thus far:</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, doesn&#x27;t make noise, and is effortless, but I just don&#x27;t know that it is worth it and or even effective.</li>
            <li> I am excited about how much more improvement I will have as I continue to use the mask.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use too!</li>
            <li> It is easy and just 15 minutes a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about returning it unless I find an easy workaround.</li>
            <li> This mask is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> I have traveled with it and have found it easy to use because it&#x27;s portable</li>
            <li> So easy and convenient</li>
            <li> So..... easy to use, affordable price</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product on the basis of the consumer having realistic expectations and giving it a fair trial.  </li>
            <li> The mask is super easy to use and I can see a difference in about a week, and of course gets better as you use it.</li>
            <li> Well, this is a fine example of MAKE</li>
            <li> I could see the fine lines lessening on my face.</li>
            <li> softer and fuller, fine lines and wrinkles have faded as if they were plumped up and smoothed out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 and am beginning to notice aging issues like sunspots and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these, I&#x27;ve been a proponent of cold laser treatment for years and have experienced the wonderful benefits they offer.</li>
            <li> and I hope having my eyelids exposed to the light won&#x27;t hurt my vision.</li>
            <li> Great product, used twice a week, would purchase again at a latter date.  </li>
            <li> I have seen such a great improvement in my skin texture and brightness since using the Mask.  </li>
            <li> The IlluMask uses light therapy to combat aging skin.</li>
            <li> I have use the mask 5 times and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I really want to be able to use the skin machines I buy as many times as I want.</li>
            <li> Really works!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I feel really good about the fact that there is an easy and affordable way for me to do something to remedy the aging skin on my face, and I am enjoying the positive results!</li>
            <li> Since the Illumask requires your face to be clean and free of oils before use, I scrub my face with a diaper wipe before I use it.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and results are so quick.</li>
            <li> The product is so easy to use and the 15 minute sessions go by quickly.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> MAKE sure you read the instructions first before you start playing with the controller and pressing on and off the power button...</li>
            <li> I have been using the IlluMask Anti-Aging Light Therapy Mask for 41 days so far, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I am 40 and my laugh lines have almost disappeared!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> that well so you will still see bright red light while you sit there for 15 minutes wasting away 15 minutes of your life.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing special about these LEDs.</li>
            <li> but it works really nicely right now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now finding I don&#x27;t need as much makeup my skin appears healthy and relaxed.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the full 30 days.</li>
            <li> I had really good skin to start with but the mask is helping me to get my glow back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the mask is only good for 30 times.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the price for light therapy during the winter season.</li>
            <li> The first week or two were fine.</li>
            <li> Clearer, tighter and more vibrant skin.</li>
            <li> My face looks more relaxed and vibrant.</li>
            <li> The very first mask, I got at Target.  </li>
            <li> however I thought it would soft a couple very fine lines</li>
            <li> The laser lights are good for a long time!</li>
            <li> This mask is easy to use and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> how much easier can it get!!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> and I guess it will only get better!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product would get better reviews if the usage wasn&#x27;t limited to 30 days.</li>
            <li> 72 yr old woman love the product bargin at 1.00 ]</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother, softer, and has a fresh dewy look to it now.  </li>
            <li> mouth laugh lines.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> The light feels warm but not hot and it feels relaxing.  </li>
            <li> I figured what the heck right</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right,</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheaper to try this first this way than to go try it professionally somewhere else for more money.</li>
            <li> you can draw a funny face or picture on the mask with marker to be fun when you wear it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the daily 15 minute rest to reset my mind, but I am feeling much more confident about my natural appearance.</li>
            <li> Very cheap made and can only use 30 days</li>
            <li> Has anyone purchased a device recently and been able to reset it?</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;ve rambled on enough.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> the red bulbs are sold on line and can purchase power cord and make your own red light treatment.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I have seen my skin change since the first week I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Did I notice a change the first day or two - no.  </li>
            <li> Regardless whether there is truth to the company&#x27;s statements about the LEDs losing effectiveness after 30 uses (highly suspicious), the fact that nowhere on the printed packaging or the product description does the manufacturer inform the consumer that this product is hardwired to stop working after 30 flips of the on switch!!  </li>
            <li> First I keep getting emails from the manufacturer to review this.</li>
            <li> My only advice for this product, if you are going to order it, you&#x27;d better like it, because you&#x27;re stuck with it.</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> For now, a couple things about my first time using it.</li>
            <li> I am on my second Illumask and have noticed my skin is much more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my fine lines are better because I didn&#x27;t have to many, but there is a difference in the overall look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t do my research because I was totally unaware that the mask was only good for 30 days.  </li>
            <li> , this isn&#x27;t that, but it&#x27;s a constant and the results get better as you use it, I&#x27;d say I really started seeing a difference at week 3.</li>
            <li> The box, however, does boast that positive results may be seen after using the mask once a day for eight weeks.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I have seen positive improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> Starting on my second mask and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Even my family commented that the fine lines under my eyes were starting to fade noticeably.</li>
            <li> I have light blue eyes and have been squinting my whole life.</li>
            <li> smooth-- lotions and products seem to go a lot further or I don&#x27;t need as much as I used to.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think this did anything at all.</li>
            <li> this thing really works.</li>
            <li> We use to use this light in the dr, office were I woked, this is a cost effitive way to get the same result&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It takes longer - but the 15 minutes a day are a pleasure &amp; very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> After opening the package and inspecting the product, my wife and I realized that there are only 30 treatments available from this mask.  </li>
            <li> How much will it cost to reinitialize the mask?  </li>
            <li> The one area where I really want to see a difference is my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> I have all ready reviewed this item</li>
            <li> I have a very ruddy complexion with off/on rash from lupus.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot say this has done much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks  </li>
            <li> Thank you much.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really know yet</li>
            <li> The tone of my face is very even and has a glow.  </li>
            <li> this works, really really works</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really relaxing.  </li>
            <li> I just packed it in my suitcase in the original box, and it was no big deal at all.  </li>
            <li> Now, if only they would make a full body booth...</li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother, more radiant and my dark spots are gone.</li>
            <li> No where in the ad did it say you have to buy a new one every month!</li>
            <li> This is the new version!</li>
            <li> Since it is disposable after 30 days, you can make a new picture each time!  </li>
            <li> then you have to buy a whole new controller.</li>
            <li> I have used many costly products that have not given me the results this one has in this length of time and for much less money.  </li>
            <li> and  I can&#x27;t believe the difference particularly on my nose,  </li>
            <li> The mask broke after 22 uses, instead of the intended, already ridiculously limited for an LED light mask, 30 that it is supposed to come with.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Irina</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re never too old to deal with problem skin and this really helps zap congested pores and shrinks them.</li>
            <li> Maybe a few more months before you see changes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh, and another little fun thing for you artistic people out there...  </li>
            <li> I bought this mask to reduce dark spots and help with fine lines (lines and wrinkles are not my main concern).  </li>
            <li> I wore it every night consecutively for the entire time, right before bed.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, lay down or sit up put the mask on and push the button</li>
            <li> I am on my third mask and see a definite improvement on the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> since the ear pieces are too long for me, they make the whole mask sit further from my face, which allows the light to reach my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> Were it not that I could &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; the unit my self, I would rate the new style mask (because of the new controller) a zero ....</li>
            <li> Buy it and copy the instructions from the review on how to reset it with new batteries......</li>
            <li> I also do red light therapy at a local tanning salon for my body</li>
            <li> I am not sure why that is, but I also started using Beautifully Radiant Phytoceramides (also here on Amazon) a month and a half ago and the combination is a winner!  </li>
            <li> I found that by wiring a USB cable to the mask, the mask then worked fine plus those LEDs that should last near ten thousands of hours</li>
            <li> By Day 4 my 58 year old skin started to feel smoother!</li>
            <li> The only thing is I wasn&#x27;t aware that this mask is disposable.</li>
            <li> The results have definitely surprised me!</li>
            <li> My skin tone evened out and some of my fine lines and wrinkles have slightly smoothed out.  </li>
            <li> After 6 weeks I have noticed my fine lines , wrinkles and crows feet look softer and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously hard to do at first but now, and with strategically arranged pillows, I am comfortable.</li>
            <li> It works, skin gets smoother, but be careful with eyes, it&#x27;s not enough coverage, I bought it in target and been using for 4 days, I felt the light is a little strong for my eyes</li>
            <li> So clearly this business model has nothing to do with LED/product effectiveness but rather to dupe uninformed consumers.</li>
            <li> Also used the acne mask to help clear up congested pores and it works too.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is the fact that I have to buy the whole mask and battery pack every time.</li>
            <li> At my mature age I knew this was not the fountain of youth by any means.</li>
            <li> So far I would say it helps with.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use and very affordable, just $1 a day.</li>
            <li> Second, that eye protection doesn&#x27;t really go over the eyes</li>
            <li> The lines in the middle of my forehead seem to be diminishing and it&#x27;s much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every lotion, cream and serum out there, but at the end of the day a product is only going to do so much for your skin.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I have seen smoother, more even skin tone and texture without any change to my current skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I was glad to read the review on how to reset the device rather than throw it away, seems like a waste after only 30 treatments!</li>
            <li> I admit I was skeptical, but a friend uses led lights and her skin looks really good, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it&#x27;s painless.</li>
            <li> first, I thought these miniature lamps would dry me up.  </li>
            <li> I did buy my last illuMask yesterday at Walmart  and two prior to that at Walgreens as there, they were on the close-out table at half price  :-).  </li>
            <li> I noticed then looking very close into the mirror that I have dark brown rings starting under my left eye and much lighter on my right, as if I have deep pentetrated sun burns.</li>
            <li> and then the mask is no good until you purchase more treatments...</li>
            <li> But with Illumask those dark areas have faded to a light violet color, that usually only needs my regular foundation to cover now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd mask, and I must say that I absolutely love the fact that my face looks like I have just a subtle touch of airbrush on.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone has definitely evened out and a  brown spot, though not completely gone is much lighter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used twice so far.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am reading the other reviews, I see it is also much cheaper at WalMart.</li>
            <li> It did seem to help some with the puffiness, wrinkles, and bags underneath my eyes however it really didn&#x27;t perform any other miracles anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Everyday for the first 2 mos., then 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear foundation, but usually wear concealer especially around my eyes, and I do not need the concealer anymore.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been looking better, but I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s due to this mask or all the other anti-aging methods that I&#x27;ve been employing in the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> Slight smoothness after first week and then slow but steady improvement in appearance.  </li>
            <li> I may go ahead after using this one and get a more expensive mask that will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using the mask for approximately 2 1/2 weeks, and am noticing the lines around my mouth and eyes to be smoother, and the dark circles under my eyes in the morning are so much better.  </li>
            <li> But, the Mask has gigantic black blinders that more than cover my eyes, since I have a really small and narrow face.</li>
            <li> My advice is spend your money on a higher quality moisturizer, not a glorified set of LED lights that likely cost the manufacturer less than a few dollars to produce.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife, and she was disappointed to learn that the mask is only good for a limited number of uses, and does not wish to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this with an open mind and thought if it didn&#x27;t work then at least I wasn&#x27;t out of much money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this four stars only because of the limited use factor.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much brighter, less wrinkled and I&#x27;m losing the little jowls I was starting to get.</li>
            <li> and I noticed last night that seeing everything in blue has an effect of lighting up the dark.</li>
            <li> 71 yrs old have always had oily skin which of course usually brings larger pores</li>
            <li> , then they get really dark and fall off apparently - ??)</li>
            <li> I have also changed from being a lifelong side sleeper to sleeping on my back.</li>
            <li> First of all I was annoyed that after I turned it on only for a couple of seconds to see the lights, I already had 29 treatments.</li>
            <li> I mean really it was on for three seconds; why do I have to lose a treatment?</li>
            <li> However, I recently started using it every other night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very dark purple on both sides of my nose next to the inner eye.</li>
            <li> And has red, blue and green lights.</li>
            <li> I am not claustophobic but by 10 minutes I am ready to pull that thing off my face, the last 5 minutes are a serious struggle!</li>
            <li> I feel like the tiny lines around my eyes are less visible, and my skin feels softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> I used it about half a dozen times, not as constant as I should have</li>
            <li> Only been using for a month and a half and skin is noticeably softer, and deeper wrinkles are lessened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to think that it did something for my skin, but if it did, it was minimal.</li>
            <li> I plan on keeping up my daily routine for another month and the using it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also not very generous with the number of LEDs supplied.</li>
            <li> although a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; is supposed to be 15 mins long, if you turn this product on and then off after 2 seconds, the counter goes down one</li>
            <li> I am actually finding myself using less makeup to cover up dark spots and my under-eye dark circles have lessened.</li>
            <li> I almost want to take away a star because having to sit in the dark for 15 min for me is difficult, but I&#x27;m leaving the 5 star review because the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> But, the reset directions in other reviews and on the You Tube videos do not match up to the &amp;#34;innards&amp;#34; of my device.</li>
            <li> My skin may appear to be a bit brighter (but could it be the other skin care products I am using doing that).  </li>
            <li> Pretty lame.</li>
            <li> DRM taken to extreme, wasteful.</li>
            <li> hot, can&#x27;t breathe, bored.  </li>
            <li> Please be careful to anyone who uses this or other products like it!</li>
            <li> I see no change in the dark spots, my skin is drier and no change in pore size.  </li>
            <li> Freaked out a bit too when I saw those dark spots.</li>
            <li> I started using tattoo cover as concealer, because the color was so dark.</li>
            <li> This product started breaking down at 7th time of use.  </li>
            <li> Less lines and wrinkles , lighted dark spots</li>
            <li> Im a week into using it, and I have less wrinkles, and a couple of bumps on my skin</li>
            <li> and I find am needing less foundation to get an even skin tone (I am fair-skinned with reddish undertones, melasma, and freckles).  </li>
            <li> I can wear less make up</li>
            <li> I have been using this for less than 30 days.  </li>
            <li> And yes you only get 30 treatments which is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I do believe there was an improvement in the texture of my face and a little less puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> mask looks a little tight.</li>
            <li> They are less expensive than buying them from Amazon which really surprised me.</li>
            <li> stopped working after a few days</li>
            <li> I followed all the trouble shooting  instructions.</li>
            <li> After just a few treatments with the mask, I had noticed a reduction in redness.  </li>
            <li> Waste your money</li>
            <li> Then when I tried to restart it some of the sessions were wasted.</li>
            <li> I wish i knew that before I wasted two.  </li>
            <li> I will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used the illumask everyday for almost a month now</li>
            <li> That said I have discovered a few comments indicating that there are ways to reset the counter</li>
            <li> Another little secret, shhhhh don&#x27;t tell anyone, but I have had a couple of breakouts in the past 41 days, and the pimples were gone the very next day, literally.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but I NEEDED to try this weird looking contraption.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little bummed out that after 30 uses you have to buy something additional that is really not nice because by accident I click the click or three times</li>
            <li> I now have only 26 treatments left :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for it working or not, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually so thirsty</li>
            <li> If you read the reviews, very few are written by &amp;#34; verified purchasers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Just today i went to work with no makeup, a co worker said i looked like i had a healing black eye!!</li>
            <li> Too expensive in the long run.</li>
            <li> Has gotten rid of dry patches on my face that no lotion, potion, cream or serum has been unable to.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t require continuous re-purchases... which, to me, seems to be something of a ripoff.</li>
            <li> Seems it could be engineered for at least 90 days of treatments per unit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy that they put out such a product that limits your use.</li>
            <li> but if not at least three times a week.</li>
            <li> mine were subtle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, but I can tell that my skin is brighter and fresher.  </li>
            <li> and I have forgotten to put moisturizer on at least 3 times now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked that mere lights could make such a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy about the limit on uses.</li>
            <li> , I felt my eyes gets tired and lite pain in my eye.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Not good for the environments there makers!</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that I do not see one iota of difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This sort of practice should be illegal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wrong to make a bunch of masks and force them to stop working after 30 uses.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the manufacturer should to be in a hurry for my review as it will not boost sales.  </li>
            <li> Skeptical</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to do, I&#x27;m afraid to put anything but moisterizer on it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend told me I was crazy for trying it</li>
            <li> I find the time in it to be very uncomfortable:  </li>
            <li> my bad.  </li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;m terribly night blind</li>
            <li> Terribly, horribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too claustrophobic.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY disgusted with this type of product advertisement!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think this did anything at all. I wore it every night consecutively for the entire time, right before bed. I did not notice my face looking any different at all. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, doesn&#x27;t make noise, and is effortless, but I just don&#x27;t know that it is worth it and or even effective.</li>
            <li> Came on time and it looks good.&lt;br /&gt;Its not for me, its a gift!&lt;br /&gt;I hope my sister will like this!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> How come it cuts off and don&#x27;t turn back on after  30 uses?</li>
            <li> Broke before I could get all of the uses.</li>
            <li> this thing really works. Im a week into using it, and I have less wrinkles, and a couple of bumps on my skin the dermatologist told me not to worry about have shrunk. The only problem is I have now found the mask at Walmart for $29.95</li>
            <li> I like the mask. It seems to be working. I also found someone on ebay to reset my mask so I can continue to use it even after its 30 uses!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Illumask for 33 days, no I did not experience &amp;#34;immediate&amp;#34; results, mine were subtle.  But then I&#x27;m &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; too! After 33 days I have noticed an amazing result and will continue to use it.  I use it first thing when I wake up in the morning GREAT way to wake up!  I&#x27;m now finding I don&#x27;t need as much makeup my skin appears healthy and relaxed. Please don&#x27;t quit after 30 days, give it another 30 to be fair. Good luck- go look AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The mask broke after 22 uses, instead of the intended, already ridiculously limited for an LED light mask, 30 that it is supposed to come with. The craftsmanship is very low quality. I&#x27;d like to think that it did something for my skin, but if it did, it was minimal. My advice is spend your money on a higher quality moisturizer, not a glorified set of LED lights that likely cost the manufacturer less than a few dollars to produce.</li>
            <li> We use to use this light in the dr, office were I woked, this is a cost effitive way to get the same result&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have use the mask 5 times and so far so good.  I have noticed the redness in my cheeks are already gone. My face looks smoother -  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after another week.  This product is easy to use, lay down or sit up put the mask on and push the button how much easier can it get!!</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible product! I&#x27;ve had laser photo treatments at the dermotogists office - and this is just as good and cost effective. It takes longer - but the 15 minutes a day are a pleasure &amp; very relaxing.  I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my skin.....never mind the husband calling me &amp;#34;Jason&amp;#34;.... The only downside!!</li>
            <li> It only lasts a month. No where in the ad did it say you have to buy a new one every month!</li>
            <li> I love the mask and eye mask from IlluMask. It is easy and just 15 minutes a day. So relaxing and I fell asleep with it on! I had just had a chemical peel and it helped with my skin relief!</li>
            <li> Let me say, I&#x27;ve tried a number of products to get ahead of the curve in my aging skin. This product has been an amazing addition to my beauty routine. So easy to use and results are so quick. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 months. People ask what have I done and how can they get one. I plan on keeping up my daily routine for another month and the using it a few times a week. Clearer, tighter and more vibrant skin. I am a believer!</li>
            <li> I believe it is removing redness and softening skin surface - it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> It does what it says lights ur face. The problem there was no mention of how it has a life span of 26 treatments then you have to buy a whole new controller.</li>
            <li> Well, this is a fine example of MAKE SURE YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE BUYING.... I didn&#x27;t realize you only get &amp;#34;30 treatments&amp;#34; with this and then the mask is no good until you purchase more treatments... my bad.  MAKE sure you read the instructions first before you start playing with the controller and pressing on and off the power button... because overtime you push that button.. you lose a treatment.  I now have only 26 treatments left :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat Emptor for sure!</li>
            <li> I admit I was skeptical, but a friend uses led lights and her skin looks really good, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it&#x27;s painless. I look younger than I did a year ago! My skin is much brighter, less wrinkled and I&#x27;m losing the little jowls I was starting to get. I&#x27;m shocked that mere lights could make such a difference. Now, if only they would make a full body booth...</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I have been using it for 3 mos. Everyday for the first 2 mos., then 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> This product started breaking down at 7th time of use.  The lights started going out at 18 uses and by15 uses there were 5 lights out.</li>
            <li> After opening the package and inspecting the product, my wife and I realized that there are only 30 treatments available from this mask.  We are only going to get 29 treatments because we turned it on to see if the product was functioning then we realized that the treatments are metered.  What happens when we run out of treatments?  How much will it cost to reinitialize the mask?  If I knew about this 30 treatment limit, I would have NEVER considered buying this for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Information concerning this limit does not appear in your TV advertisements. It does not appear on the box either. The box, however, does boast that positive results may be seen after using the mask once a day for eight weeks.  That&#x27;s about 56 treatment sessions.  I am VERY disgusted with this type of product advertisement!</li>
            <li> stopped working after a few days</li>
            <li> This is the new version! When it arrived it worked once than the circuit board went belly up. Being a tech type, I had to open it up. I found that by wiring a USB cable to the mask, the mask then worked fine plus those LEDs that should last near ten thousands of hours will now get a chance to do so. Were it not that I could &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; the unit my self, I would rate the new style mask (because of the new controller) a zero .... but it works really nicely right now!</li>
            <li> Did not receive the mask only the box that it was suppose to be in.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the full 30 days. I am sorry to say that I do not see one iota of difference in my skin. The manufacturer says that for maximum effects, it should be used for 8 weeks. But, I have not yet decided if it is worthwhile continuing. I had thought I would try to reset the device so I could give it another 30 days. But, the reset directions in other reviews and on the You Tube videos do not match up to the &amp;#34;innards&amp;#34; of my device. The markings are completely different. Has anyone purchased a device recently and been able to reset it? If so, I would appreciate some help. If not, I will probably not continue with the regimen as I am not convinced it will have any further benefits. I have one of the hand held devices from a different manufacturer and may go back to that. At least it doesn&#x27;t require continuous re-purchases... which, to me, seems to be something of a ripoff. UPDATE: I returned this product as I could not justify spending more money on a product that had done nothing it promised. BUYER BEWARE !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review if I see more results the more I use this. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that I have zero blackheads now. I always had them in the area where my nostrils attach to my cheek and also halfway between my lower lip and the bottom of my chin. I use to use pore strips and those never could get every one of them. However, I never had a standard face cleansing regimen before. Since the Illumask requires your face to be clean and free of oils before use, I scrub my face with a diaper wipe before I use it. (I don&#x27;t wear makeup and have never had acne problems.) So, I&#x27;ve been wondering if my blackheads&#x27; disappearance is from my daily diaper wipe cleansing or from the Illumask.  The one area where I really want to see a difference is my crow&#x27;s feet. I have light blue eyes and have been squinting my whole life. But, the Mask has gigantic black blinders that more than cover my eyes, since I have a really small and narrow face. So, I lay on my back with the Mask on and since the ear pieces are too long for me, they make the whole mask sit further from my face, which allows the light to reach my crow&#x27;s feet. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll work and I hope having my eyelids exposed to the light won&#x27;t hurt my vision. It just makes everything blue for a while after it&#x27;s done. Although, I&#x27;m terribly night blind and I noticed last night that seeing everything in blue has an effect of lighting up the dark. I&#x27;ll comment on that, as well, after I&#x27;ve used this longer.  Ok I&#x27;ve rambled on enough. I&#x27;ll comment more in about a month.</li>
            <li> This mask stops working after 30 uses. That&#x27;s fraud. There&#x27;s nothing special about these LEDs. They should last for 100,000 hours. This sort of practice should be illegal. It&#x27;s wrong to make a bunch of masks and force them to stop working after 30 uses. They&#x27;ll end up in land fills and polluting the water supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask looks a little tight. They&#x27;re also not very generous with the number of LEDs supplied. I&#x27;d say look for something better that doesn&#x27;t intentionally stop working. If they&#x27;ll lie about that what else are they lying about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for it working or not, I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m thinking about returning it unless I find an easy workaround. Some are wiring it with a switch to bypass the limitation.</li>
            <li> 72 yr old woman love the product bargin at 1.00 ]Dr day makes me relax for 15 mins ha but love it all can see the difference</li>
            <li> I am on my third mask and see a definite improvement on the fine lines and wrinkles. The only problem I have is the fact that I have to buy the whole mask and battery pack every time. Is there a way to just purchase the detachable battery pack?</li>
            <li> I have all ready reviewed this item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used twice so far.  I like it.  It&#x27;s relaxing.  After 30 days, I will comment again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It works well, but 6 lights went out in the mask. Save your money.  Google the red bulbs are sold on line and can purchase power cord and make your own red light treatment.</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first two sessions. On third session would not work. I followed all the trouble shooting  instructions. It will no longer work!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a recommendation in a magazine.  I guess I didn&#x27;t do my research because I was totally unaware that the mask was only good for 30 days.  There was no instruction on returning it, so I had to keep it.  Now that I am reading the other reviews, I see it is also much cheaper at WalMart. Terribly, horribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Less lines and wrinkles , lighted dark spots</li>
            <li> I bought this with an open mind and thought if it didn&#x27;t work then at least I wasn&#x27;t out of much money.  I can not get over the difference in my skin.  I have a very ruddy complexion with off/on rash from lupus.  After just a few treatments with the mask, I had noticed a reduction in redness.  I only have 5 treatments left now and it&#x27;s a world of difference.  I&#x27;m not sure if my fine lines are better because I didn&#x27;t have to many, but there is a difference in the overall look and feel of my skin.  I am going on 49 and I feel it took 5 years off.  I am going to buy another mask and do another 4 weeks of treatment when I am through with this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it.  Waste your money</li>
            <li> I have been using my IlluMask for two weeks and also love the results.  My skin is more even in color already and I find am needing less foundation to get an even skin tone (I am fair-skinned with reddish undertones, melasma, and freckles).  The product is so easy to use and the 15 minute sessions go by quickly.  I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I have been using the IlluMask Anti-Aging Light Therapy Mask for 41 days so far, and I love it!  The freckles (okay, maybe they are age spots, dunno) on my face have faded, and my overall skin tone has evened out.  My friends are telling me I look great and bright.  I feel like the tiny lines around my eyes are less visible, and my skin feels softer and smoother.  I rarely wear foundation, but usually wear concealer especially around my eyes, and I do not need the concealer anymore.  This mask is so easy to use.  I just put it on when I get into bed, press the button and it has an automatic shut-off when the 15 minutes are up.  It is also very comfortable.  I even fall asleep with it on sometimes.  It is also easy to travel with.  I just packed it in my suitcase in the original box, and it was no big deal at all.  Another little secret, shhhhh don&#x27;t tell anyone, but I have had a couple of breakouts in the past 41 days, and the pimples were gone the very next day, literally.  Oh, and another little fun thing for you artistic people out there...  you can draw a funny face or picture on the mask with marker to be fun when you wear it.  Since it is disposable after 30 days, you can make a new picture each time!  (I can&#x27;t be the only one who tried the drawing, can I?) Overall, I feel really good about the fact that there is an easy and affordable way for me to do something to remedy the aging skin on my face, and I am enjoying the positive results!</li>
            <li> I Love this product!  It really works! I am on mask 2 and have been using this product for 45 days.  I have seen my skin change since the first week I started using it.  My skin feels smoother, softer, and has a fresh dewy look to it now.  I can wear less make up and whatever make up I do put on goes on smoother.  I am 40 and my laugh lines have almost disappeared!  I also have hyper-pigmentation and have noticed the spots on my face are lighter now too.  I use it after I shower and have incorporated it into my morning routine.  I have traveled with it and have found it easy to use because it&#x27;s portable and I do not have to plug it in to use it.  The light feels warm but not hot and it feels relaxing.  I have used many costly products that have not given me the results this one has in this length of time and for much less money.  I have received numerous compliments from friends and one of them has started using it as well.  I would highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I bought this unit at Walmart for $29.99. I figured what the heck right, it&#x27;s cheaper to try this first this way than to go try it professionally somewhere else for more money. It did seem to help some with the puffiness, wrinkles, and bags underneath my eyes however it really didn&#x27;t perform any other miracles anywhere else. So, you try it, see what you think.</li>
            <li> Just got it felt good for the first time using.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little bummed out that after 30 uses you have to buy something additional that is really not nice because by accident I click the click or three times so I used up three of my sessions and there&#x27;s no way to retrieve it back I think this is a rip off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this four stars only because of the limited use factor.  Seems it could be engineered for at least 90 days of treatments per unit.  That being said - I&#x27;ve had no problems with the mask or battery function as some reviewers say they&#x27;ve had.  Works great for me thus far: AND, I&#x27;m very pleased with what is happening with my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using the mask for three months now as I wanted to give a review based on a fair length of dedicated use.  My skin tone has definitely evened out and a  brown spot, though not completely gone is much lighter.  I&#x27;m 71 yrs old have always had oily skin which of course usually brings larger pores and  I can&#x27;t believe the difference particularly on my nose,  Vast difference.  Did I notice a change the first day or two - no.  Slight smoothness after first week and then slow but steady improvement in appearance.  At my mature age I knew this was not the fountain of youth by any means. It has not made all my wrinkles disappear but has helped.  It&#x27;s really worth 15 minutes a day and is way more effective than I anticipated.  I would recommend this product on the basis of the consumer having realistic expectations and giving it a fair trial.  No product is a cure-all or effective for 100% of people.  I did buy my last illuMask yesterday at Walmart  and two prior to that at Walgreens as there, they were on the close-out table at half price  :-).  The very first mask, I got at Target.  They are less expensive than buying them from Amazon which really surprised me.</li>
            <li> Saw no change in my skin what so ever. I&#x27;m disappointed. Maybe a few more months before you see changes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy about the limit on uses. If it takes longer then 30 days to see changes, than give 60 or 90 uses. I&#x27;m sure the product would get better reviews if the usage wasn&#x27;t limited to 30 days.</li>
            <li> Started malfunctioning before the treatments were done. Then when I tried to restart it some of the sessions were wasted.</li>
            <li> I bought the mask 10 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;I try anything anti aging, and I had seen them before.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and I have to recommend this product 100%&lt;br /&gt;It should come in a more durable mask that buyers can change the batteries in.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M.Grady Oklahoma.</li>
            <li> After one use...some of the lights quit working</li>
            <li> It works, skin gets smoother, but be careful with eyes, it&#x27;s not enough coverage, I bought it in target and been using for 4 days, I felt the light is a little strong for my eyes, I felt my eyes gets tired and lite pain in my eye. If I will continue again, I will definitely but something to cover my eyes along with the glass.</li>
            <li> I have used the Illumask for several weeks now and I have already noticed an improvement in the tone and color of my skin. it looks smoother and brighter. I really love it and think it is a great product and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Regardless whether there is truth to the company&#x27;s statements about the LEDs losing effectiveness after 30 uses (highly suspicious), the fact that nowhere on the printed packaging or the product description does the manufacturer inform the consumer that this product is hardwired to stop working after 30 flips of the on switch!!  That&#x27;s right, although a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; is supposed to be 15 mins long, if you turn this product on and then off after 2 seconds, the counter goes down one and you have used one of the precious 30 &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34;.  So clearly this business model has nothing to do with LED/product effectiveness but rather to dupe uninformed consumers. Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> The first week or two were fine. Then one of the pieces that goes over the ear fell off. I noticed then looking very close into the mirror that I have dark brown rings starting under my left eye and much lighter on my right, as if I have deep pentetrated sun burns. I&#x27;m horrified, I have fair skin and it hasn&#x27;t gone away in weeks. Just today i went to work with no makeup, a co worker said i looked like i had a healing black eye!! I don&#x27;t know what to do, I&#x27;m afraid to put anything but moisterizer on it. I read up on this device and it&#x27;s not fda approved, only pending. Complete disappointment. My boyfriend told me I was crazy for trying it however I thought it would soft a couple very fine lines I have and maybe assist with evening my skin tone. It looked like a safe innovative device, however I now hate this product! Please be careful to anyone who uses this or other products like it!</li>
            <li> First I keep getting emails from the manufacturer to review this. Second, three stars is a struggle but 2 is too low.  I have been using this for less than 30 days.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer should to be in a hurry for my review as it will not boost sales.  I bought this mask to reduce dark spots and help with fine lines (lines and wrinkles are not my main concern).  I have 4 days left and I cannot say this has done much.  My skin may appear to be a bit brighter (but could it be the other skin care products I am using doing that).  I see no change in the dark spots, my skin is drier and no change in pore size.  If I can do the reset, I MIGHT continue to use it if I can do the reset.  Otherwise, I would not purchases another one.  One other note, as far as relaxing!  It is not!  I am not claustophobic but by 10 minutes I am ready to pull that thing off my face, the last 5 minutes are a serious struggle!</li>
            <li> I could see the fine lines lessening on my face.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife, and she was disappointed to learn that the mask is only good for a limited number of uses, and does not wish to use it. I&#x27;ve attempted to return it through Amazon (who declined to accept it) and LaLumiere itself (who have also declined to accept the return). So no return and no refund. My only advice for this product, if you are going to order it, you&#x27;d better like it, because you&#x27;re stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Pretty lame. Will only work 30 times and then becomes unusable. DRM taken to extreme, wasteful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for 3 months and have seen a noticeable difference in my overall look. I look younger and I&#x27;ve had compliments from people that didn&#x27;t know I was using anything. I just ordered 4 more masks because I don&#x27;t want to run out. I&#x27;ve had ulthera, botox and juvederm, so I know what those results look like, this isn&#x27;t that, but it&#x27;s a constant and the results get better as you use it, I&#x27;d say I really started seeing a difference at week 3. I almost want to take away a star because having to sit in the dark for 15 min for me is difficult, but I&#x27;m leaving the 5 star review because the results are worth it. Best part for me are the &amp;#34;puppet&amp;#34; lines around my mouth are VERY diminished.</li>
            <li> I received an email from Amazon asking me to review this product, so I will. I also do red light therapy at a local tanning salon for my body and I love it. The mask is super easy to use and I can see a difference in about a week, and of course gets better as you use it. I use a collagen spray as well on my face that the spa gave me for their beds.  Collegenetics is a good brand. So far I would say it helps with. Sun damage spots, pores, firming and a nice glow after. I am on my second mask and I plan on using this in the future. Lines around my mouth are about 50% better and lines between my brows cleared up as well about 50%. I don&#x27;t think there is a cream out there I have not tried that works better then this so if your skeptical, don&#x27;t be. Try it! It&#x27;s 30 bucks:) I&#x27;m 50 this year and do not tan my skin anymore- I do sprays but if you tan you should consider this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using  Illumask for several months &amp; I have seen positive improvements in my skin. My skin is glowing! My pores are smaller, lines are finer, skin tone &amp; texture is smoother &amp; brighter, I  look forward to my &amp;#34;15 mins of ME time&amp;#34;,  before I go to bed, I wash my face, throw on my earbuds &amp; relax under the mask, then I apply a  night time moisturizer, It&#x27;s a great affordable skin treatment. I have recommended the IlluMask to my family &amp; friends. It&#x27;s nice to get compliments on my skin, people tell me all the time that I have a beautiful complexion. Thanks  B Pullara. West Palm Beach Florida</li>
            <li> you only get 30 uses and then you throw it away</li>
            <li> I actually can tell a difference when I use it.</li>
            <li> This really works!  It&#x27;s subtle, but I can tell that my skin is brighter and fresher.  I am a fan!!</li>
            <li> The IlluMask is amazing!.. my skin looks smoother, clearer, even toned and younger! I love the product!!</li>
            <li> By Day 4 my 58 year old skin started to feel smoother! This mask is easy to use and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Great product, used twice a week, would purchase again at a latter date.  No problems, works great. Thank you much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about six months. On its own, I have seen a a very mild improvement.  However, I recently started using it every other night and it seems to work better. I am not sure why that is, but I also started using Beautifully Radiant Phytoceramides (also here on Amazon) a month and a half ago and the combination is a winner!  I am seeing definite improvement in wrinkles under my eyes and in side- of- the- mouth laugh lines. It could be the phytoceramides alone, but I find the mask relaxing and use it just before bed. I have also changed from being a lifelong side sleeper to sleeping on my back. Ridiculously hard to do at first but now, and with strategically arranged pillows, I am comfortable. If you are buying this product and haven&#x27;t seen the results you want, try the phytoceramides to see if they help.</li>
            <li> I  only gave it one star, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t let me write a review.  I never got the thing to turn on.  So I returned it.</li>
            <li> It has to be a scam. If you read the reviews, very few are written by &amp;#34; verified purchasers&amp;#34;. That fact alone raises my suspicions.</li>
            <li> Only get 30 treatments.  I wish i knew that before I wasted two.  Won&#x27;t buy again. Too expensive in the long run.</li>
            <li> Skeptical but it seem to work and notice some difference! Effective light gives me tighter and smoother skin! The only thing is I wasn&#x27;t aware that this mask is disposable. You can only use it for 30 days because the control has a counter. But you can youtube hacks on how to reuse it, so it&#x27;s all good. It&#x27;s crazy that they put out such a product that limits your use.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stick with it - I find the time in it to be very uncomfortable:  hot, can&#x27;t breathe, bored.  My boyfriend (after recovering from his fright) calls it my Daft Punk mask.  I used it about half a dozen times, not as constant as I should have I guess, it made a couple of brown spots on my face darker (which I read it is supposed to do, then they get really dark and fall off apparently - ??) but I just couldn&#x27;t stick with it.  Too claustrophobic.  Freaked out a bit too when I saw those dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am on my second mask and I have noticed a lot of improvement in the texture of my skin. My face feels softer and fuller, fine lines and wrinkles have faded as if they were plumped up and smoothed out. I had really good skin to start with but the mask is helping me to get my glow back. My face looks more relaxed and vibrant. I am excited about how much more improvement I will have as I continue to use the mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for a last 30 days.I was very skeptical at first,but Im very pleased with the results. My skin looks smoother, more radiant and my dark spots are gone. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Irina K.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using  the ialluMask Anti-Aging Mask. I do believe there was an improvement in the texture of my face and a little less puffiness under my eyes. I would take the fifteen minutes immediately upon waking in the morning, it was nice way to start the day.  I plan to look into getting a refill of treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd mask, and I must say that I absolutely love the fact that my face looks like I have just a subtle touch of airbrush on.  My face is now clearer, brighter, smoother, and MORE RADIANT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought these miniature lamps would dry me up.  On the contrary:  I  look softer, my skin feels softer and I&#x27;m eating up the compliments.  :)</li>
            <li> The best compliment I can give is to repurchase the treatment refills...and I did.</li>
            <li> I like it though I have yet to see the results</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but I NEEDED to try this weird looking contraption. The results have definitely surprised me! After a few weeks, I have seen smoother, more even skin tone and texture without any change to my current skincare routine. I am actually finding myself using less makeup to cover up dark spots and my under-eye dark circles have lessened. I don&#x27;t know if it is the daily 15 minute rest to reset my mind, but I am feeling much more confident about my natural appearance.</li>
            <li> Starting on my second mask and am very pleased with the results.  I am seeing definite improvements in the tone and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 5x so don&#x27;t really know yet that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars. when I finish the sessions I will be better able to rate.</li>
            <li> I have seen such a great improvement in my skin texture and brightness since using the Mask.  I had always had some back heads around my eyes and they are all gone now.  I also have found that the 15 minutes a day is such a relaxing addition to my day.  Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I am a 72 year old women who likes looking her best.  I have used the illuMask for 30 days and am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;My fine lines around my eyes and lips have greatly improved.  My skin has a much better tone and texture.  It is simple to use and very affordable, just $1 a day.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought this was going to be a joke, but I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin and I&#x27;ve got about 18 days left and I guess it will only get better!  Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Just bought this product today so I can&#x27;t testify to the results yet. I will update my review in a few weeks. For now, a couple things about my first time using it. First of all I was annoyed that after I turned it on only for a couple of seconds to see the lights, I already had 29 treatments. I mean really it was on for three seconds; why do I have to lose a treatment? And yes you only get 30 treatments which is ridiculous. You&#x27;re telling me you could not put more treatments than 30 into the mask? It&#x27;s just a way to get my money out of people. Second, that eye protection doesn&#x27;t really go over the eyes that well so you will still see bright red light while you sit there for 15 minutes wasting away 15 minutes of your life. I got a headache afterwards. I will try using it every day if I can but if not at least three times a week. I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Buy this product from ulta.com where it&#x27;s $29.99.</li>
            <li> I didnt know I was buying something that could only be used 30 times.  I will likely return it.&lt;br /&gt;it will stop functioning at the end of 30 uses.  I really want to be able to use the skin machines I buy as many times as I want.</li>
            <li> Very cheap made and can only use 30 days</li>
            <li> I have used the illumask everyday for almost a month now and I love the results.  My skin tone evened out and some of my fine lines and wrinkles have slightly smoothed out.  I like the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Really works!!! Only been using for a month and a half and skin is noticeably softer, and deeper wrinkles are lessened. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have used the mask for a month and my skin does look fresher.  I am going to continue using it!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, will purchase again</li>
            <li> I have been using the mask for approximately 2 1/2 weeks, and am noticing the lines around my mouth and eyes to be smoother, and the dark circles under my eyes in the morning are so much better.  I am planning on using the mask for 90 days, because I think it takes time to get maximum results.  The tone of my face is very even and has a glow.  Im looking forward to seeing what the next couple of months bring!</li>
            <li> I honestly LOVE my Illumask. I had been getting &#x27;filler treatments&#x27;, (last one was last June), but started using the Illumask about 5 weeks ago. I (almost) immediately (starting 2-3 days onto use) saw impurities start to purge from my skin, then disappear. I never had anything &#x27;done&#x27; around my eyes, but was starting to consider it. Even my family commented that the fine lines under my eyes were starting to fade noticeably. I&#x27;ve always had very dark purple on both sides of my nose next to the inner eye. I started using tattoo cover as concealer, because the color was so dark. But with Illumask those dark areas have faded to a light violet color, that usually only needs my regular foundation to cover now. If this has all occurred in just 5 weeks, I can&#x27;t wait to note the difference after three more. My skin is much more hydrated as well, and all around, I really LOVE this easy to use, and so inexpensive treatment.</li>
            <li> this works, really really works</li>
            <li> If you are even considering buying this, buy it! Has gotten rid of dry patches on my face that no lotion, potion, cream or serum has been unable to.</li>
            <li> Just started using the mask and already got compliments on looking younger! Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> 5 Star product and 1 star company.  Planned opsolecance is a dispicable mission statement for consumer driven commerce.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second mask now and hoping to see results soon. I don&#x27;t understand why the mask is only good for 30 times. LED lights last for years. They have it so you discard after 30 days.....should make it last longer. I may go ahead after using this one and get a more expensive mask that will last a very long time. And has red, blue and green lights. More cost effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using the IlluMask for over a month now, and I am just beginning to see a difference . I am pleased with my results.  I now have smoother, firmer and more moisture. My skin is usually so thirsty and I have forgotten to put moisturizer on at least 3 times now! It has to be this product!</li>
            <li> I am on my second Illumask and have noticed my skin is much more smooth-- lotions and products seem to go a lot further or I don&#x27;t need as much as I used to.  The lines in the middle of my forehead seem to be diminishing and it&#x27;s much smoother.  My skin seems brighter, discolored spots are lightening.  Super easy to use.  Would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I do this every morning and it&#x27;s really relaxing.  I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helping with my skin but it&#x27;s worth the price for light therapy during the winter season.</li>
            <li> I like it. I find using it quite soothing at times. My skin has been looking better, but I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s due to this mask or all the other anti-aging methods that I&#x27;ve been employing in the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is just too easy to use! I use it in the morning before I get out of bed. So easy and convenient and it delivers results. I&#x27;m 42 and am beginning to notice aging issues like sunspots and fine lines. Sine using this (3 months now) I have definitely noticed smoother texture and lighter tone of skin. you can now buy additional controllers so that you don&#x27;t have to throw away the mask after 30 uses. Brilliant! Also used the acne mask to help clear up congested pores and it works too. You&#x27;re never too old to deal with problem skin and this really helps zap congested pores and shrinks them.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this product if I had known it was disposable. Feeling cheated! That said I have discovered a few comments indicating that there are ways to reset the counter so I will try it instead of returning it. I will post a review, with my results, after using it for 30 days and attempting a reset.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these, I&#x27;ve been a proponent of cold laser treatment for years and have experienced the wonderful benefits they offer. I was glad to read the review on how to reset the device rather than throw it away, seems like a waste after only 30 treatments! Not good for the environments there makers! Buy it and copy the instructions from the review on how to reset it with new batteries......why not? The laser lights are good for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have been using the IlluMask for 6 weeks now and I love love love it!! I have tried every lotion, cream and serum out there, but at the end of the day a product is only going to do so much for your skin. The IlluMask uses light therapy to combat aging skin. Super easy to use too! Put on the mask, click it on, and relax for 15 minutes. My skin looks relaxed, refreshed, and glowing when the mask comes off. After 6 weeks I have noticed my fine lines , wrinkles and crows feet look softer and less noticeable. My skin looks and feels smoother, and the tone and color appear to have improved. So..... easy to use, affordable price, good results &#x3D;  2 THUMBS UP!!</li>
