            <li>Really effective in growing eyelashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li>This is the best haircare product that I have ever used and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is all natural Vitamin E, perfect to rub into scar tissue to help the skin heal and diminish permanent scarring.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it improved my scars any, since I don&#x27;t really have that many to see, but it does keep my skin incredibly moist.</li>
            <li>Best results come for me when mixed with emollient lotion and applying to moist skin.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Has a healthy glow and sheen.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I would purchase again as I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>As I started to learn about the toxicity of most beauty products, I began to search for alternatives.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the oil</li>
            <li>now my skin look so smothe.i will buy more of the oil in weeks to come</li>
            <li>luck finding a better product.</li>
            <li>However, it ended up being a fabulous cure for me!</li>
            <li>I have been to the dermatologist many times and always told I had contact dermatitis</li>
            <li>I am using this product for several areas and it is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>Great for new scars and scabs.</li>
            <li>This vitamin E oil is fantastic, very sticky but really good.</li>
            <li>Not GMO free or chemical free though.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair shiny and smooth and helps heal split ends.</li>
            <li>My primary had suggested I spread Vitamin E on the scar.  </li>
            <li>fragrance free organic blah blah blah.</li>
            <li>There do not seem to be any fillers, just a good and simple vitamin e oil that is fantastic on skin.  </li>
            <li>Our first bottle was shipped wrapped and was just what fine.</li>
            <li>i uses this in combination with HomeHealth&#x27;s Almond Glow while pregnant and didn&#x27;t get any stretch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s neither goopy nor runny and absorbs fairly quickly with noticeable effects.</li>
            <li>The synthetic kind is neither absorbed as well, nor as effective as the natural, and you have the potential to develop an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin E is a natural form, which is very important when deciding on what type of vitamin E to purchase.</li>
            <li>A bit deceiving to most people, in my opinion, to call their product natural when the vitamin E itself can be synthetic.</li>
            <li>powerful stuff</li>
            <li>Natural vitamin E is absorbed much better than synthetic and does not pose the health risks of synthetic.</li>
            <li>And because of Vitamin E&#x27;s skin healing properties, you can put it on any scrapes or scars you might have to help them heal faster and/or more completely.</li>
            <li>Turns out having a chemistry degree is useful sometimes.</li>
            <li>I use this vitamin E mostly on my hair and would say it is much better than argon oil or any other type of oil.</li>
            <li>and it has really helped to make it not look so severe!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to be 2 months soon since it was first applied, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements at all.</li>
            <li>I have compared pricing with other places, and this is by far the best price that I found for the 32,000 IU Extra Strength.</li>
            <li>Dry skin people will LOVE this.</li>
            <li>product is pure/ if you want it less dense use your own quality oil carrier or tincture</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t say D-Alpha anywhere which I guess indicates pure Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>I hope this items stays natural and quality, as it is becoming more and more difficult to buy quality items as companies try to cut corners.</li>
            <li>The oil is very thick, which is perfect for me since I mix in equal parts with castor oil and coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Works very well for scars.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But really I wanted an oil.</li>
            <li>keep in mind 32,000 is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>and the stitches were very large.but</li>
            <li>Very deceptive labeling &amp;#34;natural</li>
            <li>I found it useful to wear an old cotton nightgown and apply the Vitamin E oil at night.  </li>
            <li>Does feel sticky but that didn&#x27;t really bother me much.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it really works.</li>
            <li>24 hours after putting this on my husband I noticed my hands were perfectly clear - something I haven&#x27;t seen in years!</li>
            <li>The wand attached to lid helps to take the right amount to dribble onto my hand to mix with the other oils which I dispense with a dropper and mix each time, however I could imagine it could get messy if you wanted to take a greater quantity each time.</li>
            <li>I like the product but not sure what to compare it to since this is the first bottle I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s goey and clear and seems to mix well with my other oils and butters (coconut, Shea, calendula and rosehip) which I use to make my own moisturiser.</li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t clog pores and it&#x27;s oil, it keeps my oil production down and pretty much eliminated my acne!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for mild to moderate acne sufferers.</li>
            <li>I ordered a different pure E Oil instead.</li>
            <li>My second bottle got to my house leaking the very sticky oil eveywhere.</li>
            <li>It could even be a mixture of synthetic and natural, in my opinion, from what they say.</li>
            <li>I will switch brands to an all natural vit e. Home Health as someone else recommended in an answer to a question here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is my go-to all natural lip gloss replacement.</li>
            <li>Functionally, it makes my lips soft.</li>
            <li>Vitamin e is just a blanket name for a family of compounds--some natural some synthetic.</li>
            <li>Odd that you can&#x27;t really spread it on like an oil, cause it&#x27;s really tacky.  </li>
            <li>Probably the cap was loose since the bottle is not broken.</li>
            <li>When I first got my first bottle, it was EXTREMELY hard to open, then I took it with me on my travels, it leaks everywhere.</li>
            <li>they get comes from different sources, so it can be either natural or synthetic, so it seems to me you never know which you are getting.  </li>
            <li>Disappointed as I went to great pains searching for a REAL Vitamin E with hopes of using both internally as well as externally but bottle specifically says for external use only.</li>
            <li>I am using it as an undereye moisturizer and it has really help with the appearance of my dark circles.</li>
            <li>Super thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but if you put a little in the area of concern and apply Almond Glow it really helps to spread it out.</li>

            <li> I usually pour into a measuring spoon, but it comes with a brush applicator which would be much easier to use if just applying that way.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long but has seemed to help with skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> If you want more ounces of cheap low grade vitamin E mixed with nasty fillers buy the other brands.</li>
            <li> Glass bottle was cracked when we received it, it should have been properly wrapped with the other items.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my dry areas on my hands , elbows and arms.  </li>
            <li> And any dry spot in face or limbs/&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> I will keep applying it on the scar, but then I will also use it for my dry finger tips...</li>
            <li> I once read a statistic that the average American women ingests five pounds of beauty products through her skin and mouth each year.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s five pounds of toxic sludge, including organic hormone disruptors as well as heavy metals, that our poor livers are having to contend with instead of doing all of all the other important functions like breakdown of fat and recycling of hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cheaper alternatives to this oil have less IU or use synthetic low grade industrial produced vitamin E.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually super painful, so if you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d beware.&lt;br</li>
            <li> made my facial scar almost disappear in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if my earlier review got posted.</li>
            <li> Trying it under the eyes, too, due to a couple dark spots.</li>
            <li> Does well healing acne scars, a little thicker than I expected but stirring it helps.</li>
            <li> Other vitamin E has much less IU.</li>
            <li> It helped alot after a surgery to get the scar tissue down.  </li>
            <li> Upset that I received the bottle and it was already half</li>
            <li> This has a little plastic piece to dip in the jar and spread it on.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit thick and sticky, so you have to be a little careful when using.  </li>
            <li> It is very messy to use.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t wait to use for at least 4 weeks to see the improvement.</li>
            <li> One complaint is the packaging.</li>
            <li> Thick, quality serum.</li>
            <li> like molasses so thick, not like a lotion or cream at all.  </li>
            <li> I like the oil itself, but the bottle it comes in is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very thick, and it&#x27;s hard to use it.</li>
            <li> Thick, protective barrier!  </li>
            <li> It is very thick and you can feel it working!</li>
            <li> cause I was sick of popping capsules for my vitamin e.</li>
            <li> Anyways the oil seeped out from the bottle:(.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E to slather on a very nasty raised scar on my foot.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this oil, I think it&#x27;s the synthetic version though. It doesn&#x27;t say D-Alpha anywhere which I guess indicates pure Vitamin E. I&#x27;ve been using over a surgical incision for about 9 days and I&#x27;m almost out. It didn&#x27;t last very long but has seemed to help with skin discoloration. I ordered a different pure E Oil instead.</li>
            <li> Super thick and moisturizing. Best results come for me when mixed with emollient lotion and applying to moist skin.  Dewey appearance. Dry skin people will LOVE this.</li>
            <li> made my facial scar almost disappear in just a few weeks.  good stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> Excellent vitamin e serum!!It is doing a very good job clearing up my skin!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this item.  I add it to my whipped coconut oil and use it for a moisturizer.  It is a bit thick and sticky, so you have to be a little careful when using.  I usually pour into a measuring spoon, but it comes with a brush applicator which would be much easier to use if just applying that way.  I have compared pricing with other places, and this is by far the best price that I found for the 32,000 IU Extra Strength.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my earlier review got posted. Anyways the oil seeped out from the bottle:(. Probably the cap was loose since the bottle is not broken. Upset that I received the bottle and it was already half</li>
            <li> I like the oil itself, but the bottle it comes in is ridiculous. It is very messy to use. I probably will not but this brand again because of that.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my salves and lotions.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Feels like smearing honey on my face - ha! But after one week, I can already see a difference in my skin. Has a healthy glow and sheen. Trying it under the eyes, too, due to a couple dark spots. No effect yet, but I figure that will probably take longer than a week. Happy with product!</li>
            <li> got my oil yesterday thank you</li>
            <li> Use it on my face twice day. I don&#x27;t know if it improved my scars any, since I don&#x27;t really have that many to see, but it does keep my skin incredibly moist. I use it instead of moisturizer, and it works wonders! Since it doesn&#x27;t clog pores and it&#x27;s oil, it keeps my oil production down and pretty much eliminated my acne! Definitely recommend for mild to moderate acne sufferers.</li>
            <li> Great Item-Great Seller</li>
            <li> Works very well for scars. Not GMO free or chemical free though.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s so concentrated, I can&#x27;t wait to use for at least 4 weeks to see the improvement. Will update.</li>
            <li> Love. Thick, quality serum.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is a bit gooey like the consistency of honey without being sticky, but I do not mind.  It helped alot after a surgery to get the scar tissue down.  I would purchase again as I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Leaked when received but nice product!</li>
            <li> Just ordered a second bottle. This vitamin E oil is fantastic, very sticky but really good. I am using it as an undereye moisturizer and it has really help with the appearance of my dark circles. I have also applied it to acne scars on my face and it has helped the appearance of those scars. One complaint is the packaging. When I first got my first bottle, it was EXTREMELY hard to open, then I took it with me on my travels, it leaks everywhere. My second bottle got to my house leaking the very sticky oil eveywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy this again even if I hadn&#x27;t gotten the add on price.  It is very thick and you can feel it working!</li>
            <li> I just called customer service at Jason and I was told the vitamin e they get comes from different sources, so it can be either natural or synthetic, so it seems to me you never know which you are getting.  It could even be a mixture of synthetic and natural, in my opinion, from what they say. A bit deceiving to most people, in my opinion, to call their product natural when the vitamin E itself can be synthetic. This also goes for their 5,000 iu product in the 4 oz bottles with blend of carrier oils which I use for moisturizing and massage. I will switch brands to an all natural vit e. Home Health as someone else recommended in an answer to a question here.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My husband uses it on  his scar from back surgery and it has really helped to make it not look so severe!  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great oil!  I use it on my dry areas on my hands , elbows and arms.  Recommended</li>
            <li> Glass bottle was cracked when we received it, it should have been properly wrapped with the other items.  Our first bottle was shipped wrapped and was just what fine.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for several areas and it is AMAZING!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Odd that you can&#x27;t really spread it on like an oil, cause it&#x27;s really tacky.  I&#x27;m applying it to my toenail and the wrinkles on my face in hopes it helps to lessen them....if by some miracle it does..I&#x27;ll update my review.  But really I wanted an oil.</li>
            <li> like molasses so thick, not like a lotion or cream at all.  powerful stuff, super-concentrated Vitamin E, syrup.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin E is a natural form, which is very important when deciding on what type of vitamin E to purchase. Natural vitamin E is absorbed much better than synthetic and does not pose the health risks of synthetic. I use this vitamin E mostly on my hair and would say it is much better than argon oil or any other type of oil. This leaves my hair shiny and smooth and helps heal split ends. This is the best haircare product that I have ever used and highly recommend it. Other vitamin E has much less IU. keep in mind 32,000 is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much. The cheaper alternatives to this oil have less IU or use synthetic low grade industrial produced vitamin E. If you want more ounces of cheap low grade vitamin E mixed with nasty fillers buy the other brands. I prefer quality, over quantity. I hope this items stays natural and quality, as it is becoming more and more difficult to buy quality items as companies try to cut corners.</li>
            <li> The vitamin e has worked on my heel and ankle. The skin color has returned.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Repeat user/ excellent around eyes where crow&#x27;s feet appear/ i use in evening.... And any dry spot in face or limbs/&lt;br /&gt;Its product is pure/ if you want it less dense use your own quality oil carrier or tincture</li>
            <li> I like the product but not sure what to compare it to since this is the first bottle I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s goey and clear and seems to mix well with my other oils and butters (coconut, Shea, calendula and rosehip) which I use to make my own moisturiser. The wand attached to lid helps to take the right amount to dribble onto my hand to mix with the other oils which I dispense with a dropper and mix each time, however I could imagine it could get messy if you wanted to take a greater quantity each time. I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> i uses this in combination with HomeHealth&#x27;s Almond Glow while pregnant and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks!&lt;br /&gt;It is sticky like honey but if you put a little in the area of concern and apply Almond Glow it really helps to spread it out. I love it!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very thick, and it&#x27;s hard to use it. I&#x27;d rather buy Vitamin E not so concentrated.</li>
            <li> As I started to learn about the toxicity of most beauty products, I began to search for alternatives. I once read a statistic that the average American women ingests five pounds of beauty products through her skin and mouth each year. That&#x27;s five pounds of toxic sludge, including organic hormone disruptors as well as heavy metals, that our poor livers are having to contend with instead of doing all of all the other important functions like breakdown of fat and recycling of hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is my go-to all natural lip gloss replacement. I can throw it in my purse with no worries. Cosmetically, it provides an awesome shine. Functionally, it makes my lips soft. And because of Vitamin E&#x27;s skin healing properties, you can put it on any scrapes or scars you might have to help them heal faster and/or more completely. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E to slather on a very nasty raised scar on my foot.  My primary had suggested I spread Vitamin E on the scar.  Using capsules, I kept bursting them in all directions.  This has a little plastic piece to dip in the jar and spread it on.  I&#x27;ve noticed the scar is not as raised as it was.  Have to see if it continues to disappear.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. The oil is very thick, which is perfect for me since I mix in equal parts with castor oil and coconut oil. Really effective in growing eyelashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li> Product came unsealed and leaked all over box.</li>
            <li> I love the oil it works great .i had knee surgery  and the stitches were very large.but now my skin look so smothe.i will buy more of the oil in weeks to come</li>
            <li> Disappointed as I went to great pains searching for a REAL Vitamin E with hopes of using both internally as well as externally but bottle specifically says for external use only.</li>
            <li> Very deceptive labeling &amp;#34;natural skin oil&amp;#34; fragrance free organic blah blah blah. Bought this cause I was sick of popping capsules for my vitamin e. Got an allergic reaction and started doing research--found out that this &amp;#34;natural skin oil&amp;#34; is in fact, synthetically made! Who would have guessed!? Probably not you until you read this. Turns out having a chemistry degree is useful sometimes. Vitamin e is just a blanket name for a family of compounds--some natural some synthetic. The synthetic kind is neither absorbed as well, nor as effective as the natural, and you have the potential to develop an allergic reaction to it. Google it. It&#x27;s actually super painful, so if you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck finding a better product.</li>
            <li> I bought it in mid November 2014 with the hope that it would help smooth out the scar on my son&#x27;s elbow as a result of the surgery treating his broken elbow. It&#x27;s going to be 2 months soon since it was first applied, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements at all. I will keep applying it on the scar, but then I will also use it for my dry finger tips...probably it would help relieve the dryness.</li>
            <li> This is not synthetic.  It is all natural Vitamin E, perfect to rub into scar tissue to help the skin heal and diminish permanent scarring.  For me, it worked beautifully!  Just rub it into scars and let the body absorb it.  I found it useful to wear an old cotton nightgown and apply the Vitamin E oil at night.  The scars faded with daily Vitamin E application.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help treat a scar of my daughter&#x27;s and can&#x27;t help but be impressed by just how nice this stuff is.  There do not seem to be any fillers, just a good and simple vitamin e oil that is fantastic on skin.  It&#x27;s neither goopy nor runny and absorbs fairly quickly with noticeable effects.</li>
            <li> Thick, protective barrier!  Great for new scars and scabs.</li>
            <li> Bought this to put on a surgical scar my husband has. However, it ended up being a fabulous cure for me! I have been to the dermatologist many times and always told I had contact dermatitis - I am a nurse - I was given the strongest hydrocortisone ointment made but it only made my skin friable - then I used an antibiotic ointment to help with the cracks - nothing worked. 24 hours after putting this on my husband I noticed my hands were perfectly clear - something I haven&#x27;t seen in years! LOVE this stuff!! See my pictures</li>
            <li> Does well healing acne scars, a little thicker than I expected but stirring it helps. Does feel sticky but that didn&#x27;t really bother me much.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it really works. When I recieved it. It wasnt sealed correctly &amp; was all over the box.</li>
