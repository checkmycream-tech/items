            <li>I bought this stuff because I love skinceuticals products.</li>
            <li>The burn lessened as I used it more</li>
            <li>now 3 weeks later my skin is flawless.</li>
            <li>I will post again after more time has passed.</li>
            <li>I have no affiliation to the Baumann store, just happy to get a good product sealed and recently made.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this magical elixir does it, but it clears up my stubborn Rosacea-like face rash.</li>
            <li>Nothing on this Earth has been able to touch it.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Love this seller</li>
            <li>Somehow it makes my throat itch even more when breathing it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my son and his skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was so slippery that every time I tried to grab it, it slipped and more poured out.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product</li>
            <li>Now i lost more than that and no sympathy from Java.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I ran out of the sample and decided to order more online.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that for the most part it&#x27;s keeping my acne at bay.....</li>
            <li>and if I&#x27;m still satisfied, I will try it again.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll save alotta money and get better results.</li>
            <li>I love the face cleanser, too.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m 32 and still have acne, although the type of pimples has changed with time, getting more on my neck and lots of clogged pores.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin.</li>
            <li>My aesthetician told me to try the Blemish + Age Defense, and I admit, at first it wasn&#x27;t doing a ton of good in my existing skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>I still get some break outs, but the amazing thing is that if I apply it at night my skin looks great the next day.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed how good this serum is,no more breakouts,works fast.</li>
            <li>I know it is science doing something chemically important to my face, to be able to transform it to an even tone and texture.</li>
            <li>Great for adult acne.</li>
            <li>It is really great for anyone experiencing adult acne.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely  have any kind of break out now.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2+ years, I have seen such good results, it clears up my blemishes and makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li>I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>Clears up mild acne or mild rosacea breakouts and gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a huge hint:  </li>
            <li>; this product has played a huge part in my now and continuous even skin tone.</li>
            <li>This bizarre serum did it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will work for you, but it sure is worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a light moisturizer over the treatment once it had soaked into the skin.</li>
            <li>Nice product - heals blemishes fast.</li>
            <li>Ok product.. Results weren&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>Everything about this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Definetly worth it!</li>
            <li>My skin is always so much better when I use it consistently.....</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with the whole adult care acne system they offer.</li>
            <li>He said to use it once a day before bed after a clean face</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any good results from this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it at least 3 months at this point, which is a fair evaluation time in my book for any skin product.  </li>
            <li>ItÂ´s an extraordinary product.</li>
            <li>I have some mild acne scarring and discoloration</li>
            <li>For me, this regimen really works, and I&#x27;m so happy I tweaked it just enough</li>
            <li>For me, this regimen really works, and I&#x27;m so happy I tweaked it just enough</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve accidentally knocked over a bottle  of this precious serum &amp; wept quietly as cleaned up many dollars worth of skin salvation).</li>
            <li>Normally on my chin area where I&#x27;m most prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>This product is absolute bliss: easy to apply</li>
            <li>I use the 3 step kit ( the LHA cleanser, LHA toner spray &amp; this) but i think using just this if you cant afford the whole kit will help just fine.</li>
            <li>I am back and feel amazing.</li>
            <li>Could just be my own personal issue.</li>
            <li>For the most part I have clear skin except one area on my cheek that breaks out every month that time of the month.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but this has changed the texture of my skin for the better and keeps it extremely clear.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My acne breakouts I&#x27;ve been getting since a young teen have greatly reduced and</li>
            <li>Some might say it burns(on existing acne or inflammed skin) but the results are worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right when i was about to give up i found this stuff.</li>
            <li>Just had to find the right one.</li>
            <li>Blemish + Age - sounds like a party in a bottle, right?  </li>
            <li>I think I look like I did as a pimple-faced teenager right now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not rich, but while I was being treated by a skin specialist (using both special products, dermabrasion which should really be done by a professional with experience, special light and laser equipment, and more), I had so many compliments from both men and women about my skin.  </li>
            <li>only downside is that I feel it was more effective upon initial use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much acne, but when I do, this product gets rid of it quickly.  </li>
            <li>Amazon had it listed as a much more inexpensive price than Skinceuticals did, so I went with it to continue using it for a few more months.  </li>
            <li>Nobody knows exactly what it is.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It has made a tremendous difference with my complexion and keeps the skin feeling extremely soft!  </li>
            <li>I am not sure what makes it so much better than previous salicylic acid product I had tried that did not seem to do anything helpful, but this product is great.  </li>
            <li>I did peel a little but used a really hydrating moisturizer that I love (Super Salve&#x27;s Power Repair Night Cream)</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend for aging women struggling with break-outs and fine lines.</li>
            <li>This fluid is great because it treats my trouble areas (nose and forehead) without over drying.</li>
            <li>Buy the whole kit together.</li>
            <li>I no longer get breakouts and my acne marks are much lighter.  </li>
            <li>The product is a bit pricey, but when I look at how much money I&#x27;m not spending on products to camouflage my acne, I think it balances out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped my face &amp; the price points from vendors on Amazon have saved me alot of money.  </li>
            <li>Fast results and cleared skin without over drying to much.</li>
            <li>I really like this treatment.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell anything else about it.</li>
            <li>, you can purchase it at 1%, 1.5%, or 2% at a much lower cost than what Skinceuticals sells it for.  </li>
            <li>I am really dissatified with this company.  </li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m very saddened that I even purchased anything from Skinceuticals.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want to give out my age, but I&#x27;m well out of my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I receieved it very speedy</li>
            <li>If you have problem skin, it really does the job of taking the redness away and heals your face from breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use my foundation any longer because I was so much darker.</li>
            <li>This product has really kept my acne at bay...</li>
            <li>this product has been very helpful for me.</li>
            <li>Having very oily skin at age 37, Ive been struggling to find balance between an anti-aging regimen and also anti-blemish control products.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get the hype about this product.</li>
            <li>sure there are some whose skin is too sensitive to use this product twice a day without redness or peeling, but my skin has been through the gamut of OTC and prescription topical treatments that I have no problems using it twice</li>
            <li>I may switch back to my original acne treatment and add this as an anti-aging product.</li>
            <li>At first it slightly burned, on his problem skin, but now it&#x27;s healed the acne and he rarely breaks out!!</li>
            <li>My skin is becoming clear and equally.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember how many days it took to notice a difference, but it definitely was not a long time.  </li>
            <li>Its not terribly noticeable to the average bystander.</li>
            <li>This combo works beautifully for me, combined with a few other acne-specific products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>im sure helped a little, but i KNOW for certain this product got rid of all the breakouts, i have yet to have a new one either!</li>
            <li>I find I use it more during the sweaty summer months, and still keep a spot treatment in hand for the occasional ridiculously giant blemishes, but when I&#x27;m just looking for all over blemish control for those fine bumpy breakouts that won&#x27;t dry out my &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I thought it would go away when I got older</li>
            <li>My main issue is clogged pores and acne on my nose.  </li>
            <li>After trying several different products I purchased from him, I immediately went to Amazon to find a better price for each one.</li>
            <li>This particular product is the basis for almost everything in the Skinceuticals line.</li>
            <li>and this product stands for both reasons which is a comfort in knowing, also medical grade&#x27; which matters most if not all products in the market and counters are NOT~ Medical Grade and skinceuticals is...MJ</li>
            <li>Again, the price of this is exceedingly high.  </li>
            <li>Like others have said, it does sting (I&#x27;m told that&#x27;s normal) and particularly if I use it after exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>im writing on behalf of my niece who has adult acne at age 42&#x27; but wants tto target age defense also</li>
            <li>Also, since I still get adult acne as well as signs of aging, I have a real problem with oily skin which tends to break out.  </li>
            <li>(Oh, I&#x27;m gonna add that I also purchased another Skinceuticals product which is a moisturizer meant for normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>The product also darkened my complextion one shade below my normal color.</li>
            <li>Most acne products are aimed at teens and very young adults, so they don&#x27;t consider a person who is wanting not to age their skin with drying products that can be harsh.  </li>
            <li>So far this has been great as an anti-aging product, but my acne is worse than it was before I started using it!  </li>
            <li>, it clears up acne very quickly without drying your skin out and your skin feeling tight after use.</li>
            <li>and I thought that I was too old to be getting acne!  </li>
            <li>I even think it&#x27;s lightened some more of the past acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many types of products in the past, including benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and antibiotic skin creams, ointments, or gels.  </li>
            <li>This product worked for the first bottle, but second bottle did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>For me, salicylic acid does pretty much nothing, but everyone is different and some may find that salicylic acid works terrific for acne.  </li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with regular mild facial peels.  </li>
            <li>so,I spent so much money and time trying EVERYTHING &amp; NOTHING worked!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of anti-aging (I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s), but I wanted it primarily for the acne help.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear without drying it out.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne breakouts around chin and jawbone.</li>
            <li>but I definitely did not notice any real difference in my acne even after about three weeks of using this stuff.</li>
            <li>Completely vanished.</li>
            <li>$120 is not too much for something that actually works.</li>
            <li>I am a 37 year old woman</li>
            <li>I purchased the Blemish + Age Defense, received it early and used it 3 times so far</li>
            <li>Im 22 years old and have been using this product  for 6 months</li>
            <li>Though, I still have my adult acne and clogged pores.</li>
            <li>Being in our early thirties, acne is still an issue from time to time.</li>
            <li>I developed cystic acne at the age of 15 and carried the problem into adulthood.</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old and have had an issue with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>The acid in it causes the affected area to be sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li>I cannot review this product&#x27;s effectiveness because I was only able to use it for a few days.  </li>
            <li>My most recent combination had been to use a salicylic acid facewash and Retin A a few times per week, but I&#x27;d still get breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dealt with cystic acne and some deep dark acne scars and this makes my skin smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li>Might be a cheaper idea to just stick with my salicylic face wash twice daily, as that is the main ingredient in this anyway.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, products such as this one, list the main ingredient separately from additional ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of work, but the acne has healed to a point where I&#x27;m finally confident enough to put my hair behind my ears -- and I&#x27;m ready to cut my chin-length hair</li>
            <li>gave me a sample of this to clear out some acne and try to get my face back to what it was before I went off my birth control pills....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only brand that keeps my skin clear</li>
            <li>I have had acne since I was a young teen.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product that has ever gotten rid of my acne completely.</li>
            <li>I am a 50+ year old male and have battled with acne all of my life.  </li>
            <li>I always call Skin Ceutical direct when I receive a product and give them name of seller and the lot code 42xxx and this product was made in Dec 2013 and will last until Dec 2014 per Skin Ceuticals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult male (41) who still gets breakouts.  </li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product as it has been the only treatment that has actually worked to clear my adult acne.</li>
            <li>I use everyday and rarely breakout.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and have broken out even more.)  </li>
            <li>really think that for some people, the effectiveness of Blemish + Age Defense depends on the other products you use with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with hormonal acne since I was a teenager, and it recently resurfaced in my early 30&#x27;s as part of a recent PCOS diagnosis.</li>
            <li>First application might bring acne to surface for a few days</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it has kept my skin clear for nearly a year.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> its amazing, not overly drying and I plan to use this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product - it clears the skin and also polishes it with the combination of the salicylic acid and glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;*Be sure to follow with a good sunscreen if using in the day time.</li>

            <li> This is the best product for controlling breakouts on adult skin.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference in my skin!  </li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because I love skinceuticals products.</li>
            <li> The burn lessened as I used it more</li>
            <li> now 3 weeks later my skin is flawless.</li>
            <li> I will post again after more time has passed.</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation to the Baumann store, just happy to get a good product sealed and recently made.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this magical elixir does it, but it clears up my stubborn Rosacea-like face rash.</li>
            <li> Nothing on this Earth has been able to touch it.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Love this seller</li>
            <li> Somehow it makes my throat itch even more when breathing it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son and his skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was so slippery that every time I tried to grab it, it slipped and more poured out.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product</li>
            <li> Now i lost more than that and no sympathy from Java.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I ran out of the sample and decided to order more online.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that for the most part it&#x27;s keeping my acne at bay.....</li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;m still satisfied, I will try it again.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save alotta money and get better results.</li>
            <li> I love the face cleanser, too.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m 32 and still have acne, although the type of pimples has changed with time, getting more on my neck and lots of clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician told me to try the Blemish + Age Defense, and I admit, at first it wasn&#x27;t doing a ton of good in my existing skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I still get some break outs, but the amazing thing is that if I apply it at night my skin looks great the next day.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed how good this serum is,no more breakouts,works fast.</li>
            <li> I know it is science doing something chemically important to my face, to be able to transform it to an even tone and texture.</li>
            <li> Great for adult acne.</li>
            <li> It is really great for anyone experiencing adult acne.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely  have any kind of break out now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2+ years, I have seen such good results, it clears up my blemishes and makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li> I liked it very much.</li>
            <li> Clears up mild acne or mild rosacea breakouts and gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a huge hint:  </li>
            <li> ; this product has played a huge part in my now and continuous even skin tone.</li>
            <li> This bizarre serum did it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will work for you, but it sure is worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a light moisturizer over the treatment once it had soaked into the skin.</li>
            <li> Nice product - heals blemishes fast.</li>
            <li> Ok product.. Results weren&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> Everything about this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Definetly worth it!</li>
            <li> My skin is always so much better when I use it consistently.....</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with the whole adult care acne system they offer.</li>
            <li> He said to use it once a day before bed after a clean face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any good results from this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it at least 3 months at this point, which is a fair evaluation time in my book for any skin product.  </li>
            <li> ItÂ´s an extraordinary product.</li>
            <li> I have some mild acne scarring and discoloration</li>
            <li> For me, this regimen really works, and I&#x27;m so happy I tweaked it just enough</li>
            <li> For me, this regimen really works, and I&#x27;m so happy I tweaked it just enough</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve accidentally knocked over a bottle  of this precious serum &amp; wept quietly as cleaned up many dollars worth of skin salvation).</li>
            <li> Normally on my chin area where I&#x27;m most prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product is absolute bliss: easy to apply</li>
            <li> I use the 3 step kit ( the LHA cleanser, LHA toner spray &amp; this) but i think using just this if you cant afford the whole kit will help just fine.</li>
            <li> I am back and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Could just be my own personal issue.</li>
            <li> For the most part I have clear skin except one area on my cheek that breaks out every month that time of the month.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this has changed the texture of my skin for the better and keeps it extremely clear.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My acne breakouts I&#x27;ve been getting since a young teen have greatly reduced and</li>
            <li> Some might say it burns(on existing acne or inflammed skin) but the results are worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> right when i was about to give up i found this stuff.</li>
            <li> Just had to find the right one.</li>
            <li> Blemish + Age - sounds like a party in a bottle, right?  </li>
            <li> I think I look like I did as a pimple-faced teenager right now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not rich, but while I was being treated by a skin specialist (using both special products, dermabrasion which should really be done by a professional with experience, special light and laser equipment, and more), I had so many compliments from both men and women about my skin.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that I feel it was more effective upon initial use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much acne, but when I do, this product gets rid of it quickly.  </li>
            <li> Amazon had it listed as a much more inexpensive price than Skinceuticals did, so I went with it to continue using it for a few more months.  </li>
            <li> Nobody knows exactly what it is.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It has made a tremendous difference with my complexion and keeps the skin feeling extremely soft!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what makes it so much better than previous salicylic acid product I had tried that did not seem to do anything helpful, but this product is great.  </li>
            <li> I did peel a little but used a really hydrating moisturizer that I love (Super Salve&#x27;s Power Repair Night Cream)</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend for aging women struggling with break-outs and fine lines.</li>
            <li> This fluid is great because it treats my trouble areas (nose and forehead) without over drying.</li>
            <li> Buy the whole kit together.</li>
            <li> I no longer get breakouts and my acne marks are much lighter.  </li>
            <li> The product is a bit pricey, but when I look at how much money I&#x27;m not spending on products to camouflage my acne, I think it balances out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped my face &amp; the price points from vendors on Amazon have saved me alot of money.  </li>
            <li> Fast results and cleared skin without over drying to much.</li>
            <li> I really like this treatment.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell anything else about it.</li>
            <li> , you can purchase it at 1%, 1.5%, or 2% at a much lower cost than what Skinceuticals sells it for.  </li>
            <li> I am really dissatified with this company.  </li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m very saddened that I even purchased anything from Skinceuticals.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really want to give out my age, but I&#x27;m well out of my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I receieved it very speedy</li>
            <li> If you have problem skin, it really does the job of taking the redness away and heals your face from breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use my foundation any longer because I was so much darker.</li>
            <li> This product has really kept my acne at bay...</li>
            <li> this product has been very helpful for me.</li>
            <li> Having very oily skin at age 37, Ive been struggling to find balance between an anti-aging regimen and also anti-blemish control products.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get the hype about this product.</li>
            <li> sure there are some whose skin is too sensitive to use this product twice a day without redness or peeling, but my skin has been through the gamut of OTC and prescription topical treatments that I have no problems using it twice</li>
            <li> I may switch back to my original acne treatment and add this as an anti-aging product.</li>
            <li> At first it slightly burned, on his problem skin, but now it&#x27;s healed the acne and he rarely breaks out!!</li>
            <li> My skin is becoming clear and equally.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember how many days it took to notice a difference, but it definitely was not a long time.  </li>
            <li> Its not terribly noticeable to the average bystander.</li>
            <li> This combo works beautifully for me, combined with a few other acne-specific products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> im sure helped a little, but i KNOW for certain this product got rid of all the breakouts, i have yet to have a new one either!</li>
            <li> I find I use it more during the sweaty summer months, and still keep a spot treatment in hand for the occasional ridiculously giant blemishes, but when I&#x27;m just looking for all over blemish control for those fine bumpy breakouts that won&#x27;t dry out my &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I thought it would go away when I got older</li>
            <li> My main issue is clogged pores and acne on my nose.  </li>
            <li> After trying several different products I purchased from him, I immediately went to Amazon to find a better price for each one.</li>
            <li> This particular product is the basis for almost everything in the Skinceuticals line.</li>
            <li> and this product stands for both reasons which is a comfort in knowing, also medical grade&#x27; which matters most if not all products in the market and counters are NOT~ Medical Grade and skinceuticals is...MJ</li>
            <li> Again, the price of this is exceedingly high.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, it does sting (I&#x27;m told that&#x27;s normal) and particularly if I use it after exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> im writing on behalf of my niece who has adult acne at age 42&#x27; but wants tto target age defense also</li>
            <li> Also, since I still get adult acne as well as signs of aging, I have a real problem with oily skin which tends to break out.  </li>
            <li> (Oh, I&#x27;m gonna add that I also purchased another Skinceuticals product which is a moisturizer meant for normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li> The product also darkened my complextion one shade below my normal color.</li>
            <li> Most acne products are aimed at teens and very young adults, so they don&#x27;t consider a person who is wanting not to age their skin with drying products that can be harsh.  </li>
            <li> So far this has been great as an anti-aging product, but my acne is worse than it was before I started using it!  </li>
            <li> , it clears up acne very quickly without drying your skin out and your skin feeling tight after use.</li>
            <li> and I thought that I was too old to be getting acne!  </li>
            <li> I even think it&#x27;s lightened some more of the past acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many types of products in the past, including benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and antibiotic skin creams, ointments, or gels.  </li>
            <li> This product worked for the first bottle, but second bottle did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> For me, salicylic acid does pretty much nothing, but everyone is different and some may find that salicylic acid works terrific for acne.  </li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with regular mild facial peels.  </li>
            <li> so,I spent so much money and time trying EVERYTHING &amp; NOTHING worked!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of anti-aging (I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s), but I wanted it primarily for the acne help.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clear without drying it out.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne breakouts around chin and jawbone.</li>
            <li> but I definitely did not notice any real difference in my acne even after about three weeks of using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Completely vanished.</li>
            <li> $120 is not too much for something that actually works.</li>
            <li> I am a 37 year old woman</li>
            <li> I purchased the Blemish + Age Defense, received it early and used it 3 times so far</li>
            <li> Im 22 years old and have been using this product  for 6 months</li>
            <li> Though, I still have my adult acne and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Being in our early thirties, acne is still an issue from time to time.</li>
            <li> I developed cystic acne at the age of 15 and carried the problem into adulthood.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and have had an issue with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> The acid in it causes the affected area to be sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li> I cannot review this product&#x27;s effectiveness because I was only able to use it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> My most recent combination had been to use a salicylic acid facewash and Retin A a few times per week, but I&#x27;d still get breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with cystic acne and some deep dark acne scars and this makes my skin smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li> Might be a cheaper idea to just stick with my salicylic face wash twice daily, as that is the main ingredient in this anyway.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, products such as this one, list the main ingredient separately from additional ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of work, but the acne has healed to a point where I&#x27;m finally confident enough to put my hair behind my ears -- and I&#x27;m ready to cut my chin-length hair</li>
            <li> gave me a sample of this to clear out some acne and try to get my face back to what it was before I went off my birth control pills....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only brand that keeps my skin clear</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was a young teen.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that has ever gotten rid of my acne completely.</li>
            <li> I am a 50+ year old male and have battled with acne all of my life.  </li>
            <li> I always call Skin Ceutical direct when I receive a product and give them name of seller and the lot code 42xxx and this product was made in Dec 2013 and will last until Dec 2014 per Skin Ceuticals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult male (41) who still gets breakouts.  </li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as it has been the only treatment that has actually worked to clear my adult acne.</li>
            <li> I use everyday and rarely breakout.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and have broken out even more.)  </li>
            <li> really think that for some people, the effectiveness of Blemish + Age Defense depends on the other products you use with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with hormonal acne since I was a teenager, and it recently resurfaced in my early 30&#x27;s as part of a recent PCOS diagnosis.</li>
            <li> First application might bring acne to surface for a few days</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it has kept my skin clear for nearly a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and after smoking for the past 10 years and being a frequent caffeine drinker this product has made my skin look like it did when I was 18 again.</li>
            <li> Whenever I feel a future pimple coming, I use one drop morning and at night on the needed area and in about 3 days everything is back to normal with very little to no</li>
            <li> so the bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Just bought this about two weeks ago and so far I see a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin and usually develop deep acne ...</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry out the ace a little bit faster than normal but over all I did not see any reduction on my breakouts and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other salicylic acid products of similar percentage (this is 1.5%) and they made my skin red and irritated.</li>
            <li> Women want clear skin with a little bit of glow.  </li>
            <li> I took antibiotics, &amp; spent HUNDREDS on different topicals,cremes homeopathic remedies etc.</li>
            <li> I definitely have hormonal acne, and neither this nor any other salicylic acid based product has EVER helped my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Skin my dry out a bit.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or anything.  </li>
            <li> If I treat the acne, I often get areas of dry, flaky skin, which ain&#x27;t the look that women want.  </li>
            <li> Also, it does not seem to dry out my skin, and there is no irritation - unlike with benzoyl peroxide and Retin A products.</li>
            <li> After using it for only a few days, I accidentally hit the bottle over while it was open</li>
            <li> At first the price might seem daunting, but you only need a few drops to cover your face, and I have used less than 1/3 of the bottle in the past month.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> (I had the dropper in my hand) and the entire bottle spilled down my bathroom drain.  </li>
            <li> Currently half way into my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I did not breakout in the beginning, and this does not aggravate or dry out your skin like other acne products.</li>
            <li> It also seems to dry out my skin quite a bit (in combination with a couple of other products).  </li>
            <li> I spent a year  trying  everything for my whiteheads, blocked pores, acne, cysts and blackheads that arrived after I gave birth to my son.</li>
            <li> i have to say, if I skip a few days, the rash comes back, but glory hallelujah</li>
            <li> It only took a few treatments.</li>
            <li> After 25 years of using every acne product known to man (both prescription and over the counter) with minimal to no positive results, all of my acne disappeared a month after adding this product to my routine (oral anti-androgen and retin-A).</li>
            <li> The breakouts don&#x27;t disappear overnight, but they do clear up faster than they previously did and the few I do get are much less severe</li>
            <li> /&gt;Along with a few other products I use which includes: a tea tree soap and toner, and an spf 50 sunscreen, and a Morrocan Red Clay</li>
            <li> The acne would clear up, but it wasn&#x27;t preventing new deep, painful breakouts.</li>
            <li> Do not use every day &amp; a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I get occasional small pimples on my chin.</li>
            <li> and I have read in other reviews that this product should help it.</li>
            <li> On this site (Amazon.com), Skinceuticals lists a few ingredients which supposedly make up this product; however, the true fact is that when I received this product (which is very expensive), it lists only ONE INGREDIENT....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to repeat myself here:  If an acne product with salicylic acid works for your acne (this is what salicylic acid is supposed to work on...acne, not wrinkles or other forms of aging)</li>
            <li> There is nothing for age spots, nothing for wrinkles (small or deep), and nothing to moisturize.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li> so I am very careful which supplier is use.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful from who you buy.</li>
            <li> I can believe such an expensive product would have such a stupid method of use (the dropper), which leaves the bottle completely open at the top every time you use it.  </li>
            <li> (TIP: Just be careful to put that lid on tight -</li>
            <li> But this is pretty expensive for a little bottle and clearisal works just as well.</li>
            <li> A very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> In my late 20&#x27;s my face started breaking out regularly.</li>
            <li> In the past month I had never-ending unexplained breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to tell anyone who is reading my review that there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THIS BOTTLE WHICH WILL WORK ON ANY AGE-RELATED SKIN PROBLEM.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching back to the SkinTX line, its pricier but at least I get results.</li>
            <li> After trying EVERYTHING (from prescription medications to over the counter products and every dermatologist in my area), I broke down and started seeing an Aesthetician.</li>
            <li> WHICH SELLS \\&quot;SKIN CARE PRODUCTS,\\&quot; but for much, much, much less money.  </li>
            <li> the hyperpigmentation I would get from an inflammed pimple is cut in half, if not</li>
            <li> The larger painful pimples are almost entirely gone, including my constant cheek zit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take a little time to get these zits to go away, and I only hope they don&#x27;t leave dark spots behind on my face.  </li>
            <li> This product does not cause irritation for me, I&#x27;m not sure what other ingredients are in there to prevent it.</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals does not stand behind their products, they will not replace this product despite numerous conversations with customer support.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> But I switched up my regimen just slightly, and the scarring along my jawline is fading, and the deep, painful breakouts are no longer starting.</li>
            <li> I bought it after seeing how highly it was rated but it has been a disappointment.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, my face felt like it was literally on fire, I almost washed it off because it burned so bad.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but a little goes a LONG way</li>
            <li> I had used Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Acne Clearing Gel in the past with no results.  </li>
            <li> everything I usually do doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Well if you, like me, are unfortunate enough to need a product like this</li>
            <li> I start using that one week ago, so I am not sure about the benefit yet.</li>
            <li> I am currently 49 and still get acne, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> , also I don&#x27;t wear foundation, so I don&#x27;t need to remove make-up), and since then I have had fewer breakouts than I have ever had in the past 20 years, and I no longer need to use Retin A.  </li>
            <li> (In the morning I still use a salicylic acid-based face wash but am not sure if I even need it.)  </li>
            <li> Usually I put it on at night.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that it is so expensive to keep using.</li>
            <li> I am so angry and disappointed that I spent so much money on the product for it to basically spill down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have learned the hard way</li>
            <li> Hard to find a product like this.  </li>
            <li> I complained to my dermatologist about my persistent acne (I&#x27;m also using Atralin, a retinoid for almost a year now), and he suggested this product for morning use.  </li>
            <li> If I had known that in essence, the PTR gel and this product are very similar (AHA/BHA), I would never have shelled out $78 for it, but I was desperate at the time.  </li>
            <li> For decades I have been searching for something to rid my skin of these annoying, rough red patches.</li>
            <li> Rather expensive, but it dried blemishes yet made my skin softer.  </li>
            <li> Apply thin layer over the face area.</li>
            <li> if anything it was getting worse.</li>
            <li> Spend your money on products from companies that stand behind their products.  </li>
            <li> Non irritating or drying.</li>
            <li> It is not because the salicylic acid does not work on my acne, but they have made false claims on their ad here on Amazon.com that this product is a \\&quot;double-whammy\\&quot; and also works on age-related skin \\&quot;problems\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have one complaint and that is it burns for about 5 minutes after you put it on but nothing to bad.   </li>
            <li> I tend to have acne around my chin and mouth and feel insecure about not wearing make up-however this product made me look and feel</li>
            <li> and it was expensive, but I won&#x27;t repurchase.  </li>
            <li> Sorry for the rambling.  </li>
            <li> i swear, this product has killed all my horrible acne and scars too!!!</li>
            <li> I will finish the bottle b/c I don&#x27;t see it doing anything bad</li>
            <li> I HAD REALLY BAD ACNY AND STARTED USING THE RANGE</li>
            <li> My skin was really in bad condition.</li>
            <li> I was getting painful, recurring, long-lasting cystic acne all along my jawline and chin area --</li>
            <li> I know it is there, and I&#x27;m sick of it.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out in horrific blemishes after I used this product per  the directions.</li>
            <li> I tried this product a couple of times and broke out terribly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist! I wear once in the morning, once at night. Apply thin layer over the face area. Wear sunscreen over it! Skin my dry out a bit. Keep away from eyes area..</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have adult acne breakouts around chin and jawbone. You can immediately see a difference with one application.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because I love skinceuticals products. But this is pretty expensive for a little bottle and clearisal works just as well. When I first put it on, my face felt like it was literally on fire, I almost washed it off because it burned so bad. The burn lessened as I used it more but I definitely did not notice any real difference in my acne even after about three weeks of using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals is a miracle. I have had acne since I was a young teen. I thought it would go away when I got older and it never did. This is the ONLY product that has ever gotten rid of my acne completely. I use the cleanser and toner that come with the line as well. After using them for about 4 weeks my acne was GONE. Completely vanished. I did not breakout in the beginning, and this does not aggravate or dry out your skin like other acne products. I have tried everything and this is the BEST. Buy the whole kit together. $120 is not too much for something that actually works. Thank you skinceuticals for changing my life and my skin.</li>
            <li> I spent a year  trying  everything for my whiteheads, blocked pores, acne, cysts and blackheads that arrived after I gave birth to my son. I felt my skin issues were hormonal since the timing of the issues and the area( only my lower face). Dermatologists disagreed and so did my OB/GYN. so,I spent so much money and time trying EVERYTHING &amp; NOTHING worked!! if anything it was getting worse. I took antibiotics, &amp; spent HUNDREDS on different topicals,cremes homeopathic remedies etc. right when i was about to give up i found this stuff. after 1 week i saw improvements. now 3 weeks later my skin is flawless. Trust me, if you feel like youve tried everything  for problematic skin &amp; not even a dermatologist has helped and youre about to give up hope...PLEASE try this. I use the 3 step kit ( the LHA cleanser, LHA toner spray &amp; this) but i think using just this if you cant afford the whole kit will help just fine. This product literally gave me my life back because my face was so embarrassing i never wanted to leave the house or be my outgoing self. I am back and feel amazing. In addition to this I also did a 2 week liver cleanse which im sure helped a little, but i KNOW for certain this product got rid of all the breakouts, i have yet to have a new one either! its even helping with my wrinkles. its amazing, not overly drying and I plan to use this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry out the ace a little bit faster than normal but over all I did not see any reduction on my breakouts and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I am a 50+ year old male and have battled with acne all of my life.  My main issue is clogged pores and acne on my nose.  I&#x27;ve been to multiple dermatologists over the years with mixed results.  Currently, I use Retin A daily on my face, but it caused havoc on my nose.  I read about the Skinceuticals Blemish Plus Age Defense product and decided to give it a try.  I still get some break outs, but the amazing thing is that if I apply it at night my skin looks great the next day.  I use it three times a day, and have experienced no flaking or dryness.  It is expensive, but a little goes a LONG way so the bottle will last a long time.  If you&#x27;ve tried everything else, give it a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much acne, but when I do, this product gets rid of it quickly.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of anti-aging (I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s), but I wanted it primarily for the acne help.  Like others have said, it does sting (I&#x27;m told that&#x27;s normal) and particularly if I use it after exfoliating.  It also seems to dry out my skin quite a bit (in combination with a couple of other products).  So, I would suggest using a daily moisturizer.  Ironically, moisturizers are sometimes the source of my acne.  Just had to find the right one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and after smoking for the past 10 years and being a frequent caffeine drinker this product has made my skin look like it did when I was 18 again. I&#x27;ve dealt with cystic acne and some deep dark acne scars and this makes my skin smooth and radiant. Minimized my pores and evened out my skin tone drastically. I&#x27;m so happy with the whole adult care acne system they offer. Definetly worth it!</li>
            <li> ItÂ´s an extraordinary product. I liked it very much. My skin is becoming clear and equally. I recommend the treatment. The results are possible to see in two weeks.</li>
            <li> For some reason I kept having break outs on my forehead that I could not get rid of but I started using this and my break out have stopped. I have one complaint and that is it burns for about 5 minutes after you put it on but nothing to bad.   I will continue to use this!!</li>
            <li> In my late 20&#x27;s my face started breaking out regularly. I had never had problem skin and I thought that I was too old to be getting acne!  After trying EVERYTHING (from prescription medications to over the counter products and every dermatologist in my area), I broke down and started seeing an Aesthetician. This product was recommended to me by my aesthetician.  I use it in conjunction with regular mild facial peels.  This has made a huge difference in my skin!  I no longer get breakouts and my acne marks are much lighter.  The product is a bit pricey, but when I look at how much money I&#x27;m not spending on products to camouflage my acne, I think it balances out.</li>
            <li> So far this has been great as an anti-aging product, but my acne is worse than it was before I started using it!  I may switch back to my original acne treatment and add this as an anti-aging product.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I immediately received compliments on my skin after just 2 weeks of using this product. I tend to have acne around my chin and mouth and feel insecure about not wearing make up-however this product made me look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that I feel it was more effective upon initial use. Could just be my own personal issue. So I would definitely recommend buying. I&#x27;m actually all out...so I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I discovered this line of products in my dermatologist&#x27;s office. After trying several different products I purchased from him, I immediately went to Amazon to find a better price for each one. I&#x27;m 70 &amp; have problem skin. This particular product is the basis for almost everything in the Skinceuticals line. It&#x27;s really helped my face &amp; the price points from vendors on Amazon have saved me alot of money.  Shari</li>
            <li> I am 31 and still regularly having breakouts.  I had used Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Acne Clearing Gel in the past with no results.  I complained to my dermatologist about my persistent acne (I&#x27;m also using Atralin, a retinoid for almost a year now), and he suggested this product for morning use.  If I had known that in essence, the PTR gel and this product are very similar (AHA/BHA), I would never have shelled out $78 for it, but I was desperate at the time.  I don&#x27;t see any good results from this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it at least 3 months at this point, which is a fair evaluation time in my book for any skin product.  I will finish the bottle b/c I don&#x27;t see it doing anything bad and it was expensive, but I won&#x27;t repurchase.  I definitely have hormonal acne, and neither this nor any other salicylic acid based product has EVER helped my skin at all.  Not acne-wise, anyway.</li>
            <li> I am a 37 year old woman and I ordered this because I have heard great things about Skinceuticals. In the past month I had never-ending unexplained breakouts. For the most part I have clear skin except one area on my cheek that breaks out every month that time of the month. I get occasional small pimples on my chin. About twice a year my face goes haywire and everything I usually do doesn&#x27;t help. I purchased the Blemish + Age Defense, received it early and used it 3 times so far and my face is clearer than it&#x27;s been in weeks. The larger painful pimples are almost entirely gone, including my constant cheek zit. I am using 5 drops at night and I can tell this bottle is going to last forever. I did peel a little but used a really hydrating moisturizer that I love (Super Salve&#x27;s Power Repair Night Cream) and I use a face brush to cleanse which made the peeling no big deal. I plan to skip tonight and then do three nights in a row again to continue the progress. I have some mild acne scarring and discoloration and I have read in other reviews that this product should help it. I will post again after more time has passed.</li>
            <li> Best Anti Aging serum - makes skin glow and removed sun spots well and even get rid of pesky adult acne.</li>
            <li> SKIN CUETICLES IS THE BEST STUFF EVER! I HAD REALLY BAD ACNY AND STARTED USING THE RANGE AND NOW I CAN NOT GET ENOUGH OF IT. WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE</li>
            <li> Perfect and New and sealed.  I always call Skin Ceutical direct when I receive a product and give them name of seller and the lot code 42xxx and this product was made in Dec 2013 and will last until Dec 2014 per Skin Ceuticals.  I ordered Jan 2014.  I am very happy .  Also all sealed and perfect condition.  I ordered from BaumannStore.  Each store can be different.  I have learned the hard way so I am very careful which supplier is use.  I have no affiliation to the Baumann store, just happy to get a good product sealed and recently made.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this magical elixir does it, but it clears up my stubborn Rosacea-like face rash. I have pretty fair skin. I have had a reddened patch on either side of my nose since forever. Nothing on this Earth has been able to touch it. I have paid a fortune for different creams, potions, lasers, lotions, clarifying treatments, you name it. This bizarre serum did it. i have to say, if I skip a few days, the rash comes back, but glory hallelujah something works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about it. For decades I have been searching for something to rid my skin of these annoying, rough red patches. Nobody knows exactly what it is. Its not terribly noticeable to the average bystander. I know it is there, and I&#x27;m sick of it. So, this stuff is a miracle to me. I know it is science doing something chemically important to my face, to be able to transform it to an even tone and texture. I don&#x27;t know if it will work for you, but it sure is worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it took a couple weeks for the effect to kick in. However, the product lasts. A very little goes a long way. I used a light moisturizer over the treatment once it had soaked into the skin. I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for months.</li>
            <li> Fast results and cleared skin without over drying to much. I used morning and night for a week and after only spot treatment.</li>
            <li> My skin is always so much better when I use it consistently..... Love love love this stuff!  So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Im 22 years old and have been using this product  for 6 months i swear, this product has killed all my horrible acne and scars too!!! I use the LHA cleanser to!! I personally don&#x27;t like the toner but that&#x27;s just me! By the way this seller is AMAZING!!! I ordered my product on tuesday 9am she shipped it out by 11am and i got my product this morning!! Love this seller deff coming back!!!</li>
            <li> Great for adult acne. First application might bring acne to surface for a few days but then it all dries up. Gives a great glow. I can&#x27;t use to when I have seasonal allergies. Somehow it makes my throat itch even more when breathing it. But everything makes my throat itch. So I still use it when I don&#x27;t have allergies.</li>
            <li> I really like this treatment. It keeps my skin clear without drying it out. I will continue to use it daily along with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great serum! Not sticky. Did not irritate my skinâ¦  Though, I still have my adult acne and clogged pores. Skinceuticals is really a great brand!  My mother loves their anti aging products a lot.</li>
            <li> This product worked wonderfully for my husband and myself. Being in our early thirties, acne is still an issue from time to time. This nips that in the butt, while improving how your skin looks all over. Definitely recommend this product and with this seller as well!</li>
            <li> Product came promptly and with packaging in-tact.  This is an amazing product - it clears the skin and also polishes it with the combination of the salicylic acid and glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> I developed cystic acne at the age of 15 and carried the problem into adulthood. After 25 years of using every acne product known to man (both prescription and over the counter) with minimal to no positive results, all of my acne disappeared a month after adding this product to my routine (oral anti-androgen and retin-A). For me, it has been a miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out in horrific blemishes after I used this product per  the directions. I suspect mine was an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Now in my 40s, my skin which has never had a problem with acne is breaking out.  Someone recommend this but after using it for a month, doesn&#x27;t do anything except make my skin peel.</li>
            <li> Blemish + Age - sounds like a party in a bottle, right?  Well if you, like me, are unfortunate enough to need a product like this you&#x27;ll be happy to know it works.  I find I use it more during the sweaty summer months, and still keep a spot treatment in hand for the occasional ridiculously giant blemishes, but when I&#x27;m just looking for all over blemish control for those fine bumpy breakouts that won&#x27;t dry out my &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; (gasp!) skin - this is it!  (TIP: Just be careful to put that lid on tight - I&#x27;ve accidentally knocked over a bottle  of this precious serum &amp; wept quietly as cleaned up many dollars worth of skin salvation).</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son and his skin has never looked better.  At first it slightly burned, on his problem skin, but now it&#x27;s healed the acne and he rarely breaks out!!</li>
            <li> Happy with the delivery and the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult male (41) who still gets breakouts.  This fluid is great because it treats my trouble areas (nose and forehead) without over drying.</li>
            <li> I cannot review this product&#x27;s effectiveness because I was only able to use it for a few days.  I purchased the blemish plus age defense treatment on 2/15/14 for $82 at a spa.  After using it for only a few days, I accidentally hit the bottle over while it was open (I had the dropper in my hand) and the entire bottle spilled down my bathroom drain.  The bottle was so slippery that every time I tried to grab it, it slipped and more poured out.  I can believe such an expensive product would have such a stupid method of use (the dropper), which leaves the bottle completely open at the top every time you use it.  I am so angry and disappointed that I spent so much money on the product for it to basically spill down the drain.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. I start using that one week ago, so I am not sure about the benefit yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with hormonal acne since I was a teenager, and it recently resurfaced in my early 30&#x27;s as part of a recent PCOS diagnosis. I was getting painful, recurring, long-lasting cystic acne all along my jawline and chin area -- the second one breakout healed, another one started, week after week. My aesthetician told me to try the Blemish + Age Defense, and I admit, at first it wasn&#x27;t doing a ton of good in my existing skin care regimen. The acne would clear up, but it wasn&#x27;t preventing new deep, painful breakouts. But I switched up my regimen just slightly, and the scarring along my jawline is fading, and the deep, painful breakouts are no longer starting. The breakouts don&#x27;t disappear overnight, but they do clear up faster than they previously did and the few I do get are much less severe so they&#x27;re barely noticeable. I think what did the trick is to combine the Blemish + Age Defense with Skinceuticals Clarifying Cleanser, twice a day. This combo works beautifully for me, combined with a few other acne-specific products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning:&lt;br /&gt;Clarifying Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Eminence Lime Refresh Tonique&lt;br /&gt;Blemish + Age Defense&lt;br /&gt;Eminence Thermal Spring Whip Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening:&lt;br /&gt;Clarifying Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Lime Refresh Tonique&lt;br /&gt;Blemish + Age Defense&lt;br /&gt;Eminence Eight Greens Whip Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use 2-3 masks per week and an exfoliator once a week, all Eminence products for acne-prone skin. It&#x27;s a lot of work, but the acne has healed to a point where I&#x27;m finally confident enough to put my hair behind my ears -- and I&#x27;m ready to cut my chin-length hair even shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are some whose skin is too sensitive to use this product twice a day without redness or peeling, but my skin has been through the gamut of OTC and prescription topical treatments that I have no problems using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think that for some people, the effectiveness of Blemish + Age Defense depends on the other products you use with it. For me, this regimen really works, and I&#x27;m so happy I tweaked it just enough so I now get great results.ducts you use with it.

            <li> Do not purchase anything from SkinCeuticals that comes in a dropper bottle, the dropper is defective and leaks unless standing upright.  Do not pack in bag or anywhere else where it might tip over or lay on its side.  SkinCeuticals does not stand behind their products, they will not replace this product despite numerous conversations with customer support.  Spend your money on products from companies that stand behind their products.  Complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It has made a tremendous difference with my complexion and keeps the skin feeling extremely soft!  I would recommend this product to family and friends!</li>
            <li> This product does the job.  I am 47 years old and have had an issue with adult acne.  I treated some areas where a pimple was forming under the skin and it disappeared.  It only took a few treatments. I look forward to continuing with this product.  It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or anything.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> My skin was really in bad condition. This product helped me a lot. It cleared my skin and all blemishes dissapeared in 1 week. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> great produt! i love it!</li>
            <li> Just bought this about two weeks ago and so far I see a slight difference. I have only been using once a day, but am already hopeful that this will continue to work. My best friend did say she noticed a difference so that&#x27;s good! Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I never write reviews but this has changed the texture of my skin for the better and keeps it extremely clear. Was having hormonal break outs ( am 45 ) and I rarely  have any kind of break out now. Currently half way into my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This product was prescribed by my Dermatologist. IÂ´ve ben using it for 4 weeks now and it meets my needs. Excelent product!</li>
            <li> Totally loved this product.  Rather expensive, but it dried blemishes yet made my skin softer.  Hard to find a product like this.  I am currently 49 and still get acne, unfortunately.  Love this brand!!!</li>
            <li> She wanted it for christmas and she is very happy with it. I really can&#x27;t tell anything else about it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product</li>
            <li> Pros: Clears up blemishes overnight!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: There are none!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this along with the Skinceuticals Clarifying Cleanser and my Clarisonic Mia!</li>
            <li> got this product , got a rash all over my face .Try to return it but the company said  that because i opened it i cant return it.No exceptions. i should by it from the doctor office but I wanted to save 5 dollars. Now i lost more than that and no sympathy from Java. Be very careful from who you buy.I gave one start because I cant do 0.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for controlling breakouts on adult skin.  Non irritating or drying. I use everyday and rarely breakout.  Controls hormonal breakouts and helps shorten breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other salicylic acid products of similar percentage (this is 1.5%) and they made my skin red and irritated. This product does not cause irritation for me, I&#x27;m not sure what other ingredients are in there to prevent it. Well worth the money. Clears up mild acne or mild rosacea breakouts and gives my skin a nice glow. I don&#x27;t use it every morning - I alternate between this and the Skinceuticals Phorelin CF serum.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff im writing on behalf of my niece who has adult acne at age 42&#x27; but wants tto target age defense also and this product stands for both reasons which is a comfort in knowing, also medical grade&#x27; which matters most if not all products in the market and counters are NOT~ Medical Grade and skinceuticals is...MJ</li>
            <li> My derm. gave me a sample of this to clear out some acne and try to get my face back to what it was before I went off my birth control pills....(which is a horror story all by itself).  He said to use it once a day before bed after a clean face and I did.... couple weeks went by and I thought it made my acne marks a bit faded, which was great.  I ran out of the sample and decided to order more online.  Amazon had it listed as a much more inexpensive price than Skinceuticals did, so I went with it to continue using it for a few more months.  I&#x27;ve noticed that for the most part it&#x27;s keeping my acne at bay.....with the proper face care and daily skin regimen.  I even think it&#x27;s lightened some more of the past acne scars.  At this point I&#x27;m going to finish the bottle and if I&#x27;m still satisfied, I will try it again.  Might be a cheaper idea to just stick with my salicylic face wash twice daily, as that is the main ingredient in this anyway.  It did arrive packaged nicely and I have no complaints with the quality.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as it has been the only treatment that has actually worked to clear my adult acne. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This product claims to have ingredients to help both acne (salicylic acid) as well as ingredients to help with \\&quot;Age Defense\\&quot;.  On this site (Amazon.com), Skinceuticals lists a few ingredients which supposedly make up this product; however, the true fact is that when I received this product (which is very expensive), it lists only ONE INGREDIENT....salicylic acid at a level of 1.5%.  Sometimes, products such as this one, list the main ingredient separately from additional ingredients.  When I received this product (Skinceuticals Blemish Plus Age Defense Acne Treatment), it listed only the salicylic acid.  Here&#x27;s a huge hint:  YOU CAN BUY THE SAME LEVEL OF SALICYLIC ACID (1.5%) AT ANY LOCAL DRUG STORE, GROCERY STORE, OR SIMILAR STORE IN YOUR AREA WHICH SELLS \\&quot;SKIN CARE PRODUCTS,\\&quot; but for much, much, much less money.  Also, if you wish, you can purchase salicylic acid up to 2% solution (or combined in some type of cream or moisturizer or cleansing/cleanser product for the skin.  Again, the price of this is exceedingly high.  Therefore, I would not recommend this.  Also, since I still get adult acne as well as signs of aging, I have a real problem with oily skin which tends to break out.  If I treat the acne, I often get areas of dry, flaky skin, which ain&#x27;t the look that women want.  Women want clear skin with a little bit of glow.  As one ages, different people show signs of aging in different ways.  I tried this product a couple of times and broke out terribly.  For me, salicylic acid does pretty much nothing, but everyone is different and some may find that salicylic acid works terrific for acne.  I&#x27;m going to repeat myself here:  If an acne product with salicylic acid works for your acne (this is what salicylic acid is supposed to work on...acne, not wrinkles or other forms of aging), you can purchase it at 1%, 1.5%, or 2% at a much lower cost than what Skinceuticals sells it for.  I am really dissatified with this company.  It is not because the salicylic acid does not work on my acne, but they have made false claims on their ad here on Amazon.com that this product is a \\&quot;double-whammy\\&quot; and also works on age-related skin \\&quot;problems\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m sorry to tell anyone who is reading my review that there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THIS BOTTLE WHICH WILL WORK ON ANY AGE-RELATED SKIN PROBLEM.  There is nothing for age spots, nothing for wrinkles (small or deep), and nothing to moisturize.  (Oh, I&#x27;m gonna add that I also purchased another Skinceuticals product which is a moisturizer meant for normal to oily skin.  They state that it is \\&quot;Optimal for oily skin\\&quot;.  Again, I&#x27;m very saddened that I even purchased anything from Skinceuticals.  This moisturizer is extremely greasy.  I tried it and have broken out even more.)  I don&#x27;t really want to give out my age, but I&#x27;m well out of my 30&#x27;s.  I think I look like I did as a pimple-faced teenager right now.  It&#x27;s going to take a little time to get these zits to go away, and I only hope they don&#x27;t leave dark spots behind on my face.  I&#x27;m making an appointment with the skin esthetician I used to go to.  When I used to go, it meant dropping tons of money.  I&#x27;m not rich, but while I was being treated by a skin specialist (using both special products, dermabrasion which should really be done by a professional with experience, special light and laser equipment, and more), I had so many compliments from both men and women about my skin.  I was at the point where I could go without makeup and have a beautiful, glowing complexion.  Sorry for the rambling.  To sum it up, if you like this product, you can buy it for about $3.00 to $10.00 at any number of local stores in your area.  I also do not like the fact that Skinceuticals has misrepresented this product, as there is nothing in this bottle for \\&quot;age defense\\&quot; of the skin.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do a Thing for me at all. Use Clearasil or something. You&#x27;ll save alotta money and get better results. Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works GREAT. I use it everyday and it has kept my skin clear for nearly a year. I love the face cleanser, too. It&#x27;s the only brand that keeps my skin clear and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2+ years, I have seen such good results, it clears up my blemishes and makes my skin glow! I wear it under my mak-up it is great! I receieved it very speedy and it&#x27;s def affordable</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne since I was about 12.  Now I&#x27;m 32 and still have acne, although the type of pimples has changed with time, getting more on my neck and lots of clogged pores.  I have tried many types of products in the past, including benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and antibiotic skin creams, ointments, or gels.  My most recent combination had been to use a salicylic acid facewash and Retin A a few times per week, but I&#x27;d still get breakouts.  I started using this product when a skin specialist at a medispa recommended it, putting it on at night before bedtime after rinsing my face with water (no soap, also I don&#x27;t wear foundation, so I don&#x27;t need to remove make-up), and since then I have had fewer breakouts than I have ever had in the past 20 years, and I no longer need to use Retin A.  This is the only acne product I use at night.  (In the morning I still use a salicylic acid-based face wash but am not sure if I even need it.)  At first the price might seem daunting, but you only need a few drops to cover your face, and I have used less than 1/3 of the bottle in the past month.  I am not sure what makes it so much better than previous salicylic acid product I had tried that did not seem to do anything helpful, but this product is great.  I don&#x27;t remember how many days it took to notice a difference, but it definitely was not a long time.  Also, it does not seem to dry out my skin, and there is no irritation - unlike with benzoyl peroxide and Retin A products.</li>
            <li> This works well.  If you have problem skin, it really does the job of taking the redness away and heals your face from breakouts.  If you don&#x27;t like how it dries out your skin, I would use it once a day.  Usually I put it on at night.</li>
            <li> product works great. I have been very pleased. would definitely recommend for aging women struggling with break-outs and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this stuff, I have tried almost every acne product but this in combination with good eating habits did the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over two years now.  It is amazing.  It is really great for anyone experiencing adult acne.  Most acne products are aimed at teens and very young adults, so they don&#x27;t consider a person who is wanting not to age their skin with drying products that can be harsh.  This product is just that., it clears up acne very quickly without drying your skin out and your skin feeling tight after use. I use it just before bed, after I cleanse my face.  I no longer need moisturizer or toner to have great skin. I recommend it with 5 stars plus!!!</li>
            <li> This product worked for the first bottle, but second bottle did nothing for me. The product also darkened my complextion one shade below my normal color. I couldn&#x27;t use my foundation any longer because I was so much darker. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how good this serum is,no more breakouts,works fast.I tried lot of stuff-nothing to compare with it.Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Quality product and as described.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and works awesome, clears skin and helps aging skin look great. Only problem is that it is so expensive to keep using.</li>
            <li> Quality product and as described.</li>
            <li> Nice product - heals blemishes fast.</li>
            <li> Ok product.. Results weren&#x27;t worth the price. I would say any over the counter product would work just as well.</li>
            <li> PROS: It simply works! I&#x27;m an African American male model with blemish prone skin from inflammatory acne which causes hyperpigmentation. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, my existing hypermigmentation has continually faded away. My acne breakouts I&#x27;ve been getting since a young teen have greatly reduced and the hyperpigmentation I would get from an inflammed pimple is cut in half, if not more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with a few other products I use which includes: a tea tree soap and toner, and an spf 50 sunscreen, and a Morrocan Red Clay Mask(once a week); this product has played a huge part in my now and continuous even skin tone. Whenever I feel a future pimple coming, I use one drop morning and at night on the needed area and in about 3 days everything is back to normal with very little to no hyperpigmentaton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It&#x27;s stings for about five minutes! Some might say it burns(on existing acne or inflammed skin) but the results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Be sure to follow with a good sunscreen if using in the day time. The acid in it causes the affected area to be sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li> This product has really kept my acne at bay...I have normal to oily skin and usually develop deep acne ...this product has been very helpful for me.</li>
            <li> Having very oily skin at age 37, Ive been struggling to find balance between an anti-aging regimen and also anti-blemish control products. My dermatologist recommended me the Serum 10 from the same brand and I fell for the reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;Thank god I did! This product is absolute bliss: easy to apply, ultra-light texture, smells good and it is uber-efficient! Great to take when traveling as you&#x27;re 1-step for great skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks. Normally on my chin area where I&#x27;m most prone to breakouts. Note - this product can be drying! Do not use every day &amp; a little bit goes a long way. I do feel that it zaps breakouts at their first sign, which is awesome that I don&#x27;t need to suffer thru the breakout cycle!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get the hype about this product. I bought it after seeing how highly it was rated but it has been a disappointment. The bottle is just about done and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my acne. At times, my skin feels &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; from dryness, which I would happily put up with if my face was clearing up. I&#x27;m switching back to the SkinTX line, its pricier but at least I get results.</li>
            <li> Everything about this product is fantastic. I have fewer lines and blemishes after about two months of use. I had been using sample sizes, but finally decided to buy the actual product. They shipped the product to me within two days, packaged nicely so nothing broke. Wonderful service! Thanks!</li>
