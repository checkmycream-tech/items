            <li>my Grand daughter&#x27;s loved this polish.....</li>
            <li>The polish is kind of watery and also matte.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and the polish is a very good quality.  </li>
            <li>came in so quickly, the colors are awesome, the price was great... just need a clear coat and you are ready to go!!!</li>
            <li>Huge hit!</li>
            <li>When putting I need to put five coats of the polish to make it show more</li>
            <li>i would recommend it to others and its better than the ones you get in clairs.</li>
            <li>ADORABLE</li>
            <li>This product was OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I had received this product I would be able to rate it.  </li>
            <li>There is a button on top of the polish cap which lights the polish bottle.</li>
            <li>I applied glitter and a top coat over it one time</li>
            <li>my kids love the colors</li>
            <li>My daughter was expecting so much more.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>It glows really well and looks awesome in the dark... but not so awesome in the light.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even realize that there is a button on the top with a light and it makes the colors charge and glow.</li>
            <li>the colors are great and the glow really bright in the dark.</li>
            <li>Totally cool!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still satisfied with my purchase, because it&#x27;s freaking glow in the dark nail polish! :D</li>
            <li>It stays on ok though and it is really fun :)</li>
            <li>We had sex in the dark and it was awesome!</li>
            <li>To light of colors.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy; cheap and it does not glow</li>
            <li>As long as your expectations are within the scope of what an inexpensive bottle of glow polish can produce, then you will be happy with it.</li>
            <li>Super fun!</li>
            <li>It glows brightly but it will need several coats for each nail.</li>
            <li>The colors are as shown and the light in the bottle is really fun.</li>
            <li>Love this some much</li>
            <li>as far as im concerned, they peel off exceedingly easily (1 day at the most)...</li>
            <li>Fun fun stuff!</li>
            <li>For normal amount of darkness, you won&#x27;t be able to see the glow.</li>
            <li>However, you would still have to put your painted nails under a bright light in order to see the glowing results in the dark.</li>
            <li>I put a clear coat on top and put crackle nail polish on that (and more clear).</li>
            <li>does not look fresh.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll have to apply several coats, and even then it dries kind of chalky.</li>
            <li>the cap lights up for a fun touch.</li>
            <li>It Was Fun For A Slumber Party.</li>
            <li>First off this nail polish MUST be put on top of a good white nail polish because it&#x27;s to sheer to be worn alone.</li>
            <li>You can click the top of the bottle and it turns on a UV light which shows how the color will glow in the dark or under UV light.</li>
            <li>It comes in bigger bottles than i was expecting, also the &amp;#34;light up&amp;#34; makes the whole bottle glow and exposes the polish to light for you :)</li>
            <li>Delevery was super fast.</li>
            <li>The packaging of these nail polish are also so clever and cool.</li>
            <li>I got these as a birthday gift for a little girl and she loved them</li>
            <li>And as well as higher quality polish at that?</li>
            <li>overall they seem like an ok purchase...</li>
            <li>Be sure to paint a white layer of nail polish first before you paint these colors on.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even tell you are wearing it for the most part unless you put a white nail polish on under it</li>
            <li>Exactly what she wanted were the words</li>
            <li>These are very thin and you must use 3 or 4 coats to get the best results.</li>
            <li>Not only does it glow in the dark, really well, but it comes with a cool flash light top!</li>
            <li>The white will make the colors look more vibrant.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for black light situations.</li>
            <li>This nail polish really works and gives me a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li>and third you have to leave it under light in order to get it to reach the full potential.</li>
            <li>it had decent reviews</li>
            <li>you also need around 7 coats to get a decent color...</li>
            <li>The finish is not shiny (somewhat chalky) but it dries so fast, we could do the girls nails at the party and send them right back to playing.</li>
            <li>Every glow polish I have ever used has had pretty much this same consistency.</li>
            <li>Since it takes so many coats, it also takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty once you get enough coats on though.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see the glow in the dark that strong... and the polish only lasted a day or two before chipping and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they were busy painting their nails...</li>
            <li>Do people really expect this polish to perform as regular polish?</li>
            <li>I bought these as a gift for a 13 year old girl.  </li>
            <li>This is not my first time using glow polish, its not a new product at all, as a teenager we used it when we would go to the teen dance clubs.</li>
            <li>Its best used over a white base or over regular polish of coordinating color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Polish doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark or in black light.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t Really Glow In The Dark, But</li>
            <li>The glow in the dark qualities are on par with those little stars you stuck on the walls when you were little, but it&#x27;s still pretty in the light.</li>
            <li>You have to put several coats on for the color to really show &amp; it doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark</li>
            <li>They glow really well in the dark and especially under blacklight (even just one coat).</li>
            <li>It dries really fast and has a rough texture when dry.</li>
            <li>Not so very glow in the dark!</li>

            <li> The glow in the dark qualities are on par with those little stars you stuck on the walls when you were little, but it&#x27;s still pretty in the light.</li>
            <li> You have to put several coats on for the color to really show &amp; it doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark</li>

            <li> Not so very glow in the dark!</li>
            <li> The pink &amp; blue is good but the green is to thin</li>
            <li> : The glow doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Second it takes Forever to dry</li>
            <li> polish itself is weird consistency, and chips really easily.  </li>
            <li> however, if you use a white base coat, they can stay for a longer time (more or less 5 days) and you need about 2 or 3 coats to get the right color...</li>
            <li> I really cant get over the negative reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> I actually use some to dab on my remote</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t glow in the dark very long and you have to apply several coats</li>
            <li> capabilities aside, this set of polish was under $15 for 3 bottles, how long is it expected to wear?</li>
            <li> came in sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> does not really glow.</li>
            <li> This is everything that I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Well, the product is as expected.</li>
            <li> I love these colors but one needs a thic white base coat.</li>
            <li> I am not very satisfied with the consistency of the product, however I do like the colors (after multiple coats) and the glow in the dark effect.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark</li>
            <li> After awhile it fades away but that goes for anything that is glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> Got these for a glow in the dark party.</li>
            <li> I felt it was a bit costly for only three polishes that are not very great quality, won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Lights up nicely in black light.&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li> It glows in the dark!</li>
            <li> the fact that it glows in the dark is defiantly a plus!</li>
            <li> It leaked out and dried during shipment.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a few things you have to keep in mind when you decide you want to try this nail polish.</li>
            <li> however i tried it a few times and dont like it at all.</li>
            <li> as others suggested i put a base coat of white on my daughter&#x27;s nails and then had to  apply 3-4 coats to get a decent color.</li>
            <li> My grandaughter told me that these were at least $7.00 per bottle in the store.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the polish did Not glow in the dark, but they Did glow under a blacklight.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is really thin</li>
            <li> So thank you Mia Secret for wasting my time and money.</li>
            <li> It applies thin, so you&#x27;ll have to use a couple of coats.</li>
            <li> It also is very thin and matte finish.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is way too thin :(</li>
            <li> but then it looks streeky and nasty.</li>

            <li> To light of colors. When putting I need to put five coats of the polish to make it show more</li>
            <li> i would recommend it to others and its better than the ones you get in clairs. it&#x27;s cheap and look great,</li>
            <li> Seems lIke a good idea but the paint chipped off within 24 hours. Junk!</li>
            <li> nice item and good quality</li>
            <li> my Grand daughter&#x27;s loved this polish.....the bottle lights up and they were busy painting their nails...ADORABLE</li>
            <li> Good value for your money.  My grandaughter told me that these were at least $7.00 per bottle in the store.  They worked great.  The only thing I would add is put a coat of white nail polish underneath.  These are very thin and you must use 3 or 4 coats to get the best results.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this nail polish. I actually use some to dab on my remote so I can see the buttons at night.</li>
            <li> This nail polish really works and gives me a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li> Pros: The colors are as shown and the light in the bottle is really fun. The polish definitely glows.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The glow doesn&#x27;t last long. I bought 2 sets as presents but one of the bottles was damaged (cap damaged/not on correctly). It leaked out and dried during shipment.</li>
            <li> The pink &amp; blue is good but the green is to thin</li>
            <li> We had sex in the dark and it was awesome!</li>
            <li> This product was OK. There&#x27;s a few things you have to keep in mind when you decide you want to try this nail polish. First off this nail polish MUST be put on top of a good white nail polish because it&#x27;s to sheer to be worn alone. Second it takes Forever to dry and third you have to leave it under light in order to get it to reach the full potential.</li>
            <li> came in so quickly, the colors are awesome, the price was great... just need a clear coat and you are ready to go!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are great and I didn&#x27;t even realize that there is a button on the top with a light and it makes the colors charge and glow. Totally cool!</li>
            <li> came in sooner than expected. as others suggested i put a base coat of white on my daughter&#x27;s nails and then had to  apply 3-4 coats to get a decent color. not the greatest nail polish (chips off kind of easily) but my daughter (11 yrs old)loves it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled! Polish doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark or in black light. It also is very thin and matte finish.</li>
            <li> it had decent reviews so i thought that it would work well. however i tried it a few times and dont like it at all. does not look fresh. does not really glow. this is using 2-3 coats</li>
            <li> Lights up nicely in black light.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of chalky looking on nails</li>
            <li> I really cant get over the negative reviews on this product. Do people really expect this polish to perform as regular polish? And as well as higher quality polish at that? This is not my first time using glow polish, its not a new product at all, as a teenager we used it when we would go to the teen dance clubs. Every glow polish I have ever used has had pretty much this same consistency. Because of the process and ingredients used to make it phosphorescent it will not be the consistency of regular polish. Its best used over a white base or over regular polish of coordinating color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glow capabilities aside, this set of polish was under $15 for 3 bottles, how long is it expected to wear? One cannot expect it to perform like Marc Jacobs, Dior, Butter London, Ciate, Jinsoon, YSL, etc. Or even a mid grade polish like Opi or Nails inc.. Its a great product for what it is. As long as your expectations are within the scope of what an inexpensive bottle of glow polish can produce, then you will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought these because my friends and I went to the Blacklight Run. The nail polish is really thin so you&#x27;ll have to apply several coats, and even then it dries kind of chalky. Unfortunately, the polish did Not glow in the dark, but they Did glow under a blacklight.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for black light situations. For normal amount of darkness, you won&#x27;t be able to see the glow. The polish is kind of watery and also matte.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I had received this product I would be able to rate it.  Instead I received mood changing polish.  And for some reason since this product is glass you can not return it.  So thank you Mia Secret for wasting my time and money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter and she simply loves it.  The colors are vibrant and the polish is a very good quality.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for a 13 year old girl.  I don&#x27;t know how they work as nail polish because I didn&#x27;t try them, but they are awesome looking as a gift.  You can click the top of the bottle and it turns on a UV light which shows how the color will glow in the dark or under UV light. It made a very impressive gift with a manicure set.</li>
            <li> Delevery was super fast. I got these as a birthday gift for a little girl and she loved them the colors are great and the glow really bright in the dark. Super fun!</li>
            <li> as far as im concerned, they peel off exceedingly easily (1 day at the most)... you also need around 7 coats to get a decent color... however, if you use a white base coat, they can stay for a longer time (more or less 5 days) and you need about 2 or 3 coats to get the right color... this makes them a like over the price range i would have paid... overall they seem like an ok purchase...</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t glow in the dark very long and you have to apply several coats</li>
            <li> It glows in the dark! Be sure to paint a white layer of nail polish first before you paint these colors on. The white will make the colors look more vibrant. However, you would still have to put your painted nails under a bright light in order to see the glowing results in the dark. After awhile it fades away but that goes for anything that is glow in the dark. The color will glow in the color of the nail polish which is super awesome! I got a lot of complements on my nails and the fact that it glows in the dark is defiantly a plus! The packaging of these nail polish are also so clever and cool. There is a button on top of the polish cap which lights the polish bottle. Fun fun stuff!</li>
            <li> Got these for a glow in the dark party. Great colors, great glowing power, and the cap lights up for a fun touch.</li>
            <li> This polish does glow, but don&#x27;t expect it to be amazingly bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish itself is weird consistency, and chips really easily.  I applied glitter and a top coat over it one time and it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still satisfied with my purchase, because it&#x27;s freaking glow in the dark nail polish! :D</li>
            <li> It comes in bigger bottles than i was expecting, also the &amp;#34;light up&amp;#34; makes the whole bottle glow and exposes the polish to light for you :) It glows really well and looks awesome in the dark... but not so awesome in the light. You can&#x27;t even tell you are wearing it for the most part unless you put a white nail polish on under it but then it looks streeky and nasty. It stays on ok though and it is really fun :)</li>
            <li> Not so very glow in the dark!</li>
            <li> my kids love the colors</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter and her friends. They had a great time using it and seeing the magic with the lights turned off. Exactly what she wanted were the words</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see the glow in the dark that strong... and the polish only lasted a day or two before chipping and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy; cheap and it does not glow</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our daughter. It applies thin, so you&#x27;ll have to use a couple of coats. It dries really fast and has a rough texture when dry. I put a clear coat on top and put crackle nail polish on that (and more clear). The glow in the dark qualities are on par with those little stars you stuck on the walls when you were little, but it&#x27;s still pretty in the light.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter&#x27;s friend.  Of course she loved it because the glow was great, but also because her name is Mia :).  We painted her nails and that night her nails were glowing!  Love this some much I&#x27;m going to order another set for me &amp; my daughter!</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter.  You have to put several coats on for the color to really show &amp; it doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark that well.  My daughter was expecting so much more.  The colors are pretty once you get enough coats on though.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is way too thin :( it takes like 20 coats to get a color! Since it takes so many coats, it also takes a long time to dry. I am not very satisfied with the consistency of the product, however I do like the colors (after multiple coats) and the glow in the dark effect. I felt it was a bit costly for only three polishes that are not very great quality, won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> The kids loved their presents!</li>
            <li> This is everything that I expected it to be. Not only does it glow in the dark, really well, but it comes with a cool flash light top!</li>
            <li> Well, the product is as expected.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t Really Glow In The Dark, But It Was Fun For A Slumber Party. I Thought These Might Be Our Go-To Birthday Gift, But I Wont Buy Them Again.</li>
            <li> had to apply several coats....too watery</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. It glows brightly but it will need several coats for each nail. The shipping was incredibly low for sending it to Taiwan. Only $4.22 so this seller is very fair and will not cheat you on shipping. Love this seller!</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! They glow really well in the dark and especially under blacklight (even just one coat). The finish is not shiny (somewhat chalky) but it dries so fast, we could do the girls nails at the party and send them right back to playing. Huge hit!</li>
            <li> I love these colors but one needs a thic white base coat.</li>
