            <li>Neutrogena goes on clear, clean, non-oily and is super effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; as the description would have you believe as I still looked oily, but overall is a good product.</li>
            <li>I love most about the ultra sheer sunblock body mist</li>
            <li>Neutrogena has never disappointed me or my super sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He uses this in conjunction with his Banana Boat, as he needs extra protection due to his very fair and freckily skin.</li>
            <li>three-pack from was a much better price than I could find in any of my local stores.</li>

            <li>More expensive and smaller bottles but love the spray and feels much nicer on the skin than other sprays.</li>

            <li> Unlike other sunblocks, including other Netrogena options, I don&#x27;t feel it going on</li>
            <li> We reapplied every time we got out of the wave pool, liberally applying after every time we toweled dry, at least 4 times in five hours.</li>
            <li> We tried our local drug store&#x27;s brand and it was horrible -- oily, and left me pink (reaction or ineffective at blocking UV, I&#x27;m not sure).  </li>
            <li> neutrogena size, but they are 3 small cans :(  </li>
            <li> I burned so badly.</li>
            <li> Guess I am stupid for not reading and knowing that,</li>
            <li> I hate that it is opened.</li>

            <li> Bought it for my husband who swims.  He uses this in conjunction with his Banana Boat, as he needs extra protection due to his very fair and freckily skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  We tried our local drug store&#x27;s brand and it was horrible -- oily, and left me pink (reaction or ineffective at blocking UV, I&#x27;m not sure).  Neutrogena goes on clear, clean, non-oily and is super effective.</li>
            <li> More expensive and smaller bottles but love the spray and feels much nicer on the skin than other sprays. Not oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> This product came today and it is opened! I hate that it is opened.</li>
            <li> Great price, quick service</li>
            <li> My boys and I used a new can of this product today at the waterpark.  We reapplied every time we got out of the wave pool, liberally applying after every time we toweled dry, at least 4 times in five hours. As I write this my shoulders and upper back are on fire I burned so badly. I&#x27;m throwing all the cans in the recycle bin as I can&#x27;t return an aerosol can.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time  I am completely satisfied with it</li>
            <li> So convenient and easy to use. Works great at Disney on whole family!!</li>
            <li> great product sprays on easily and provides great sun protection. non greasy</li>
            <li> Just the product I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li> Product is good just be aware of the size... I thought this was the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; neutrogena size, but they are 3 small cans :(  Guess I am stupid for not reading and knowing that, but hopefully I can help someone else :)</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction.  Gave it away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using only Neutrogena sunblock since I was a kid and started having allergic reaction to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sunblock. Neutrogena has never disappointed me or my super sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about the ultra sheer sunblock body mist is in the name, it&#x27;s ultra sheer. Unlike other sunblocks, including other Netrogena options, I don&#x27;t feel it going on or once it is on my skin. In fact, I pretty much forget about it...except when I&#x27;m in the sun and I need to reapply it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This three-pack from was a much better price than I could find in any of my local stores. Perfect purchase.</li>
            <li> Not at all greasy and easy to apply</li>
            <li> easy to use  and  works well</li>
            <li> I really like this sunblock.  It worked very well on my recent trip to Mexico.  It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; as the description would have you believe as I still looked oily, but overall is a good product.</li>
            <li> Great service, great value.</li>
