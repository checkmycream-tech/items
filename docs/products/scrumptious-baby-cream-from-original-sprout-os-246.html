            <li>This lotion smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>prefer the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; kind for my babies.</li>

            <li>It leaves skin so soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Safe to use and smells AMAZING</li>
            <li>Has a good light scent.</li>
            <li>However, it comes unscented but has a distinct &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; scent which is not the most pleasant.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure glad I did.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hands mostly but also on my arms.</li>
            <li>Should have bought more.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I love this lotion for them.</li>
            <li>My two kids love it and would rub it on their faces themselves.  </li>
            <li>This is a great rich and creamy lotion, which absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li>Scent is nice, texture is just right.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural is amazing.</li>
            <li>We use it every day the baby loves it because she can get dressed quickly and start running around without being sticky and my son likes it keeps his ezcema under control :)</li>
            <li>Non-greasy and light, but still moisturizing - and this is in winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, has a light pleasant scent, and helps dry skin anytime.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin baby soft and it has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>It leaves our skin silky soft, smells amazing and does not have any toxic ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>but when I ordered this for my new grand baby I fell in love with it so much so that My husband and I both use it.</li>
            <li>It stays on nicely, scent more like &amp;#34;baby lotion&amp;#34; and fades after little bit.</li>
            <li>As an esthetician I&#x27;ve used many professional skin cares products</li>
            <li>I love this lotion so much I use it on myself as well as my 3 year old!!</li>
            <li>It absorbs really well instead of sitting on top of your skin like most other lotions.</li>
            <li>It certainly lives up to it&#x27;s description.</li>
            <li>, I ran out of face moisturizer and used it for myself and it has worked really well.</li>
            <li>The whole house loves this cream.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>However, there&#x27;s not that much</li>
            <li>Smells divine, non-oily, yet very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Goes on silky smooth and does not leave a thick greasy layer like most creams.</li>
            <li>It smells good (subtle), works well.</li>
            <li>Smells divine and do creamy and thick yet leaves you and baby super soft and light</li>
            <li>As far as how it works...great!</li>
            <li>My baby has eczema and her skin has been so soft since I started using this cream.</li>
            <li>Both of my girls have sensitive skin and this product has zero irritants, no parabens or phlalates, and is free of common allergens.</li>
            <li>The scent is sooo light and delicate.</li>
            <li>It has helped clear up my dry skin and feels soft too.</li>
            <li>Says it is baby cream, but I am an adult with very dry skin.</li>

            <li> Just like any other lotion.</li>
            <li> ; it does have scent to it due to the fact of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients: calendula, rosemary, cranberry, arnica, cucumber, coconut.</li>

            <li> well, a LITTLE ways.</li>

            <li> Both of my girls have sensitive skin and this product has zero irritants, no parabens or phlalates, and is free of common allergens. It leaves skin so soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I know that this product is supposed to be used for babies but I bought it for myself and I&#x27;m sure glad I did. It certainly lives up to it&#x27;s description. I use it on my hands mostly but also on my arms. Will try my legs next. Should have bought more. It makes my skin baby soft and it has a nice clean smell. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. Says it is baby cream, but I am an adult with very dry skin. It has helped clear up my dry skin and feels soft too. I recommend</li>
            <li> Safe to use and smells AMAZING</li>
            <li> Smells divine, works well on baby, I ran out of face moisturizer and used it for myself and it has worked really well. Non-greasy and light, but still moisturizing - and this is in winter.</li>
            <li> I want to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this lotion, but a little goes...well, a LITTLE ways. I have to use a lot and we were out of it before I knew it. For the price, that&#x27;s not a great deal. However, if you don&#x27;t mind the price, the lotion is awesome. It smells good (subtle), works well. I have used a lot of lotions &amp; def. prefer the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; kind for my babies. I rank this one up with Earth Mama Angel Baby&#x27;s and I actually alternate them. (This one is richer and thicker though).</li>
            <li> Smells divine and do creamy and thick yet leaves you and baby super soft and light non greasy We use it every day the baby loves it because she can get dressed quickly and start running around without being sticky and my son likes it keeps his ezcema under control :)</li>
            <li> I sharpied out the word &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; even before my son saw the bottle, and he is not too observant, so he didn&#x27;t notice black sharpie over the letters :) But he put it on and it smells so good, even he noticed. I like that there are not phyto or xeno estrogens. I am switching all my son&#x27;s hair and skin products to this brand to minimize his exposure to female hormones. As far as how it works...great! Just like any other lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t greasy. It&#x27;s light, has a light pleasant scent, and helps dry skin anytime. I think it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> This is a great rich and creamy lotion, which absorbs really well.  Both my kids are red heads and I love this lotion for them. Has a good light scent.</li>
            <li> As an esthetician I&#x27;ve used many professional skin cares products but when I ordered this for my new grand baby I fell in love with it so much so that My husband and I both use it. It leaves our skin silky soft, smells amazing and does not have any toxic ingredients in it. I only wish I could get it in a gallon size!  Best lotion ever I wouldn&#x27;t trust anything else on my grandson&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Great product for children. Scent is nice, texture is just right.</li>
            <li> Love the cream perfect for adults I heard about it in a magazine so I wanted to try and is great love the smell and is great for your skin</li>
            <li> The whole house loves this cream.  Goes on silky smooth and does not leave a thick greasy layer like most creams.</li>
            <li> I really like it. However, there&#x27;s not that much</li>
            <li> The scent is sooo light and delicate. Perfect for me as I am a nurse and cannot wear strong scents.</li>
            <li> No added parabens, etc. Even tho is says &amp;#34;no fragrance&amp;#34; it does have scent to it due to the fact of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients: calendula, rosemary, cranberry, arnica, cucumber, coconut. It stays on nicely, scent more like &amp;#34;baby lotion&amp;#34; and fades after little bit.</li>
            <li> Happy with the Original sprout!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing.  I love this lotion so much I use it on myself as well as my 3 year old!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my toddler, and ended up using it on myself as well. I have extremely dry and cracked hands, and this works better than any other expensive hand cream I&#x27;ve tried. Even on my cracked hands, it doesn&#x27;t sting like other lotions do. It absorbs really well instead of sitting on top of your skin like most other lotions. It&#x27;s not too thick or too runny either. It smells amazing and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural is amazing. I&#x27;ll never use another lotion again!</li>
            <li> I love this!  it is rich and creamy and provides very good moisture for my kids&#x27; skin. I also use it as a hand cream myself.  I wish they made a bigger size. However, it comes unscented but has a distinct &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; scent which is not the most pleasant. I would have given it 5 stars but didn&#x27;t because of the after smell but I can over that so I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells divine, non-oily, yet very moisturizing.  My two kids love it and would rub it on their faces themselves.  They&#x27;re always afraid it would eventually run out.</li>
            <li> My baby has eczema and her skin has been so soft since I started using this cream. Smells so good!</li>
