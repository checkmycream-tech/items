            <li>A friend gave me a huge bottle of Neutrogena rainbath some time ago.  </li>
            <li>Shower gel  is a light fragrant scent .</li>
            <li>the 40oz 3pack that amazon offers is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Shipped three bottles in original cartons and then in a USPS box.  </li>
            <li>If you have allergies to fragrances try Neutrogena original scent.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering the original fragrance</li>
            <li>I have been using the original fragrance for years.</li>
            <li>and I feel clean when I leave the room.  </li>
            <li>She looks and smells so clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>this bath gel makes me feel sooooo clean, i use it every day.</li>
            <li>I feel clean hope they will keep doing this product and</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t tear myself away from this one because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is way too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the Neutrogena, clean, refreshing, slightly musky, and I love the rich, moisturizing suds that it produces.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh, not over powering.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and</li>
            <li>exactly what was described!</li>
            <li>The product has a very clean refreshing scent and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin overly dry.</li>
            <li>Much better value at about $0.50 per ounce (with the free shipping) instead of the $1.00 per ounce for the smaller bottles that you can still find in stores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for men and women and doesn&#x27;t interfere with other fragrances like perfume or aftershave.  </li>
            <li>but this one not only lathers up easily and quickly, but it smells DIVINE!</li>
            <li>We are very pleased with the product, as we are with other neutrogena products</li>
            <li>The shipping is kind of high, but it still works out to be about the same price as if you were to buy the product in the store.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve started buying a few at a time to avoid the hassle of finding it at a good price.  </li>
            <li>This shower gel has such a unique scent~ so clean</li>
            <li>We particularly like the fresh fragrance of this gel.  </li>
            <li>so when I get in a steamy shower and use this it helps me get ready for my day.  </li>
            <li>Ordering it online and having it arrive at my door is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Very misleading.</li>
            <li>high quality shower gel.</li>
            <li>Love this item, will re-order it and have used it in the past.  </li>
            <li>so shop carefully and check the ounces to make sure you aren&#x27;t paying big prices for the smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I frequently give this as a house gift.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>You can use it on sensitive skin on occasion but not often.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s no tingling action.</li>
            <li>I know there are several other Neutrogena fragrances available</li>
            <li>We live in a very dry area so we want a mild wash that won&#x27;t dry out our skin</li>
            <li>After trying it, people love it and want to know where I got this big size, as the small one is usually the only one available in stores.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes hard to find in Target, especially the big size, so glad to find it here.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a 45 yr old male).  </li>
            <li>There are a few places online that offer this large size.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A friend introduced me to Neutrogena Rainbath shower gel a couple of years ago and I have been using it ever since. I was never a fan of body washes because I didn&#x27;t feel they produced enough lather but this one not only lathers up easily and quickly, but it smells DIVINE! I&#x27;m a fan for life. I know there are several other Neutrogena fragrances available but I can&#x27;t tear myself away from this one because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a huge bottle of Neutrogena rainbath some time ago.  It&#x27;s clean fragrance scents the bathroom pleasantly after a shower. I have since given it as gifts and replensihed my own supply.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The shipping is kind of high, but it still works out to be about the same price as if you were to buy the product in the store.</li>
            <li> I LOVE RAINBATH!!  I have tried every bath and shower gel on the market (practically!).  This one is my all-time favorite and the one that I always return to. I love being able to buy this in the large 40oz size for the shower.  I love the smell of the Neutrogena, clean, refreshing, slightly musky, and I love the rich, moisturizing suds that it produces. It makes me feel good every day.  Product came packaged nicely and was delivered quick.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Pleasant fragrance and no residue after rinsing.  I tend to suffer from dry skin;  but the Neutrogena seems to moisturize without feeling greasy or sticky.  The 40-oz bottles are getting really hard to find;  so I ordered two (2) 3-bottle sets.  Much better value at about $0.50 per ounce (with the free shipping) instead of the $1.00 per ounce for the smaller bottles that you can still find in stores.  Shipping was prompt and hassle-free!  Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better value or service.</li>
            <li> I love this product, as a matter of fact it is the only thing I can use without getting a rash. I have not been able to find it at a better price anywhere! I can&#x27;t even buy it locally for this price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time. I just find the best price.</li>
            <li> Why has this become a little tough to get?  I used to buy this at Costco and they stopped carrying it.  There are a few places online that offer this large size.  This is the only &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; my husband and I use and I&#x27;ve started buying a few at a time to avoid the hassle of finding it at a good price.  Hope this trouble doesn&#x27;t signal a discontinued product.  Prices are all over the map on this one so shop carefully and check the ounces to make sure you aren&#x27;t paying big prices for the smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena products are excellent.  We particularly like the fresh fragrance of this gel.  It&#x27;s good for men and women and doesn&#x27;t interfere with other fragrances like perfume or aftershave.  We live in a very dry area so we want a mild wash that won&#x27;t dry out our skin</li>
            <li> I frequently give this as a house gift.  With candy, people are sometimes watching their weight, or with wine their alcohol consumption.  But everyone takes a shower/bath -- hopefully.  After trying it, people love it and want to know where I got this big size, as the small one is usually the only one available in stores.  This 3 pack was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Shipped three bottles in original cartons and then in a USPS box.  Arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I would buy from this seller again.  I love this product and keep one by my kitchen sink and my guest bath.  Smells very nice, but we don&#x27;t use it as a body wash, just for hand washing.  i tried another scent and I went back to this one.  Not sure if is the \\&quot;original\\&quot; scent but it is close enough for us if not, and we are pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this item, will re-order it and have used it in the past.  Definately recommend this product to others / friends.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and exactly what was described!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a morning person so when I get in a steamy shower and use this it helps me get ready for my day.  The smell is calming and soothing and I feel clean when I leave the room.  Sigh, I want to back in bed.</li>
            <li> Good product. Will purchase again. My husband also likes the product.</li>
            <li> This is all I use,  I buy it by the bulk.  My husband and I both love it.  It has a very clean non perfumey smell and that is what I like. A small amount of it goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I love the way this soap smells, and feels.  It is a favorite of my family from my husband to all three sons-- (who are adults now)!  It makes your skin feel so soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li> The large container and 3 pack packaging make this a great value. Ordering it online and having it arrive at my door is very convenient. The product has a very clean refreshing scent and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin overly dry.</li>
            <li> Love This Stuff!  It is a thorough cleanser, but does not leave you stripped of all moisture.  Love the fragrance.  I wish I could describe the fragrance...  Clean, fresh, not over powering.</li>
            <li> Great buy in 3 pack. The shower gel has a long lasting quality and works. It is quite astringent which is not the best for sensitive skin. You can use it on sensitive skin on occasion but not often. Better than retail but it must be cheaper to manufacture than this so consider it a premium soap.</li>
            <li> Love Neutrogena Rainbath! It is moisturizing, refreshing and has a great scent.</li>
            <li> Rain bath REFRESHING shower and bath gel is one of the nicest bath and shower gels on the market. Neutrogena&lt;br /&gt;Has a wonderful line of skin care products. This shower gel has such a unique scent~ so clean ~so refreshing~ the 40oz 3pack that amazon offers is a good deal. I will always have this wonderful product in my bathroom. I even use it to shampoo my scottish terrier. She looks and smells so clean and shiny.  I love this product</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena and hope they keep the formula the way it is. I buy this product all the time, several bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> The very best and scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Everyone raved over this and I thought it would be comparable to Dr. Bonners peppermint soap. It smells good but there&#x27;s no tingling action.</li>
            <li> this bath gel makes me feel sooooo clean, i use it every day. it doesnt seem to have the  left over residue that some soaps leave behind. the smell last a long time. sometimes i use it in my hair, its that goood!</li>
            <li> high quality shower gel. This 3-piece set lasts about a year and we are a couple using it. This year we bought another set which should last until 2014. We are very pleased with the product, as we are with other neutrogena products</li>
            <li> love it, it takes me to sensual heights never before reached.  Makes skin feel smooth and silky, leaves nice clean smell</li>
            <li> I have bought this product for my wife for three years in a row.  She just loves it.  It was delived and priced just as advertized.</li>
            <li> Use this stuff everyday (I&#x27;m a 45 yr old male).  Sometimes hard to find in Target, especially the big size, so glad to find it here.  I stock up when the price is good.</li>
            <li> Shower gel  is a light fragrant scent . Product arrived in good condition and quickly. If you have allergies to fragrances try Neutrogena original scent.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the original fragrance but instead got grapefruit. It is not listed as grapefruit on the website. Very misleading. Fragrance is way too sweet for me. I have been using the original fragrance for years.</li>
            <li> I recommend it,I&#x27;ve been using it for over 25 years. it smells like rain and is relaxing also I feel clean hope they will keep doing this product and if possible have those 40 oz in Canada.</li>
