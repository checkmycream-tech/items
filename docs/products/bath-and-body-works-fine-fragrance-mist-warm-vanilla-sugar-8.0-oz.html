            <li>I wish there was an oil made from this nice smelling product.</li>
            <li>It is a warm, sugary smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really warm scenty</li>
            <li>The warm vanilla frangrance is one of my favorites, and this mister doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>Warm vanilla sugar is one of my all time</li>
            <li>A high recommendation is deemed upon WARM VANILLA SUGAR!!!</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell, but thought it would have more of the vanilla smell, but not..</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I assumed this would be my favorite as I love the smell of vanilla.</li>
            <li>LOVE this scent.</li>
            <li>It is more of a body spritz.</li>
            <li>then you will love this.</li>
            <li>and I love vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered The Body Shop&#x27;s Vanilla Spray, which I&#x27;m hoping is better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect, I can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this.  </li>
            <li>favorite B&amp;BW products.</li>
            <li>and I found the original Warm Vanilla Sugar body mist (before they changed the packaging and formula).</li>
            <li>This company offered it at a great price and shipped it promptly; I would highly recommend both the fragrance and the company that sold it.</li>
            <li>The lightly sweet scent of warm vanilla just makes me think of comfort.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;warm vanilla sugar mist&amp;#34; body spray is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The main thing we both noticed was an eau du coconut scent, which smelled remarkably like the coconut scent in most inexpensive tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li>It is very sweet.</li>
            <li>Perfect meets what I expected</li>
            <li>This is beyond my favorite spray, it smells amazing and it stays on me the whole 8 hours I&#x27;m in school</li>
            <li>It reminded me of the good days when I would shop with all of my high school friends.</li>
            <li>If you love really sweet Vanilla</li>
            <li>on it&#x27;s own or to layer it with the lotion without the scent  becoming too much for me as I have a sensitivity to some fragrances that trigger migraines.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>cause even though it has a nice sweet smell it kind of sometimes smells like old lady perfume...</li>
            <li>if you use this it&#x27;s important to not overdo it,</li>
            <li>Maybe use in a drawer to lightly scent linens or lingerie.  </li>
            <li>It was love at first smell.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described, good price, arrived when expected - very pleased with seller and purchase both.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice not hard and lound.</li>
            <li>I expected the warm vanilla sugar fragrance like the lotions, but this is overpowering and doesn&#x27;t smell like warm vanilla at all.</li>
            <li>Honestly I love sweet fragrance,but never been a warm vanilla sugar fan,it may be a personal thing</li>
            <li>I love the way Warm Vanilla Sugar smells, it is sweet but not overpowering just enough to make you smile.</li>
            <li>the aroma is good, not last</li>
            <li>I really love the whole Bath and Body Works</li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much</li>
            <li>I think I like the older type better though.</li>
            <li>This starts out with a distinct &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; odor that gradually fades to that cookie, vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I was able to find this product.</li>
            <li>I think it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to find a true vanilla scent without resorting to wearing vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet and nice, but not exactly the sugar cookie vanilla smell</li>
            <li>Was surprised when I tried the 2 fragrances and liked the other better because of</li>
            <li>, I read a review on this before I bought it that said it doesn&#x27;t spray very much well</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Vanilla.</li>
            <li>I would really like my money back but return shipping will cost more than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>planning to order the &amp;#34;Vanilla Bean Noel&amp;#34; body mist, so I hoping it will be less old-ladylike and more of a freshly baked sweet cookie smell.</li>
            <li>I love the warm smell of this its nice for the casual days or the romantic days with the man ;)</li>
            <li>This product shipped quickly and came brand new.  </li>
            <li>The one that is in an odd shaped bottle and it sprays more on you than this one but overall,love it!</li>
            <li>If you like a very sweet vanilla smell this is for you, it just lacks a key fragrance component for me.</li>
            <li>You get quite a large amount for the money.</li>
            <li>I thought the bottle looked old and scratched, maybe I just got one that had been in stock for a long time, but other than the appearance it was ok IF I was keeping it for myself, but I purchased it to give as a gift and when I give gifts I like for the gift to be presented nicely.</li>
            <li>The smell is just very divine, I always loved the fragrance ever since I was small in high school.</li>
            <li>notieced not too much alcohol as well.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;And for that reason I don&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li>It is pretty rich in its smell for a fragrance mist and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have loved the smell of vanilla since I was little, it always comforted me somehow and even now still has the same effect.</li>
            <li>apparently they bathe themselves in perfumes and such because my bottle sprays just the right amount!</li>
            <li>but it smell&#x27;s like a cheap imitation baking vanilla extract, the name is to me what sells this product.</li>
            <li>sweet and sugary a little more long lasting than drugstore brands</li>
            <li>I came across a tube of Warm Vanilla Sugar body cream that I had forgot about, I put it on and have used it everyday since because of how sweet and subtle the smell is.</li>
            <li>I favor soft fragrances so this worked...</li>
            <li>It is not a heavy perfume.</li>
            <li>I even have a sensitive sense of smell</li>
            <li>baby lotion soft but soft enough after the smell settles</li>
            <li>The exact same smell, minus the scent of alcohol I&#x27;ve had before in the same product purchased directly from Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried Victoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla Lace, which is the most vanilla of the three, but also smells of chemicals and alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It smells like I expected, strong enough for only a little use at a time, and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>I use it frequently and it will probably still last me quite a long time.</li>

            <li> The Bodycology Toasted Sugar scent is similar, but less expensive and has a bit more of a noticeable vanilla aroma.  </li>
            <li> I had simply sprayed myself with with this &amp;#34;vanilla sugar&amp;#34; spray, which to my dismay, didn&#x27;t smell remotely like vanilla.  </li>
            <li> the sad thing is that I don&#x27;t have the other stuff of warm vanilla sugar but at least I got the fragrance it smells</li>
            <li> but not as long as the other scent I bought.</li>
            <li> Not really a vanilla that gets ones attention or lasts.</li>
            <li> Not much hope for that</li>
            <li> no positive feedback from others.</li>
            <li> Maybe actual Bath and Body Works sprays last longer, but whatever I received was not good.</li>
            <li> It was a dark and stormy night.  </li>
            <li> I know body mists aren&#x27;t supposed to last long, but this was sad.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it wasn&#x27;t a bad scent, it just came across as being more like a toasted, sweetened coconut -- which is not what I was wanting.  </li>
            <li> Either order from the site, go to the store, find a different seller, or keep moving.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> Just rather weak knee-ed and vague</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle or what the deal is</li>
            <li> Maybe it was the seller (starts with a P), but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells awful and can&#x27;t be returned.</li>

            <li> Good body spray I love it</li>
            <li> i have always loved this smell! its light and perfect! i get compliments all the time when I get it</li>
            <li> When I bought this I also purchased another fragrance at the same time. I assumed this would be my favorite as I love the smell of vanilla. Was surprised when I tried the 2 fragrances and liked the other better because of it&#x27;s fruity smell. This starts out with a distinct &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; odor that gradually fades to that cookie, vanilla smell. It lasts o.k. but not as long as the other scent I bought.</li>
            <li> I expected the warm vanilla sugar fragrance like the lotions, but this is overpowering and doesn&#x27;t smell like warm vanilla at all.</li>
            <li> I thought the bottle looked old and scratched, maybe I just got one that had been in stock for a long time, but other than the appearance it was ok IF I was keeping it for myself, but I purchased it to give as a gift and when I give gifts I like for the gift to be presented nicely.</li>
            <li> It goes perfect with the Warm Vanilla Sugar body cream.  Even though I can&#x27;t smell it anymore by the end of the day, others can and I get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> There was more product than I thought there would be so I am very happy about that and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> the aroma is good, not last</li>

            <li> It smells like I expected, strong enough for only a little use at a time, and lasts quite a while. I use it frequently and it will probably still last me quite a long time. Good deal for the price and good quality.</li>
            <li> It smells awful and can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> I really love the whole Bath and Body Works Warm  Vanilla Sugar Line.  The lightly sweet scent of warm vanilla just makes me think of comfort. I like that I can choose to wear just the fragrance  mist  on it&#x27;s own or to layer it with the lotion without the scent  becoming too much for me as I have a sensitivity to some fragrances that trigger migraines.&lt;br /&gt;I have also received a lot of compliments since I have began to wear it.  I would recommend it for all ages.</li>
            <li> This is beyond my favorite spray, it smells amazing and it stays on me the whole 8 hours I&#x27;m in school and I get tons of comments on how good it smells, I read a review on this before I bought it that said it doesn&#x27;t spray very much well apparently they bathe themselves in perfumes and such because my bottle sprays just the right amount!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;warm vanilla sugar mist&amp;#34; body spray is pretty good. The smell is sweet and nice, but not exactly the sugar cookie vanilla smell I was hoping for&lt;br /&gt;But if you use this it&#x27;s important to not overdo it, cause even though it has a nice sweet smell it kind of sometimes smells like old lady perfume...&lt;br /&gt;And for that reason I don&#x27;t really use it that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning to order the &amp;#34;Vanilla Bean Noel&amp;#34; body mist, so I hoping it will be less old-ladylike and more of a freshly baked sweet cookie smell.</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent. delivered in 3 days!!</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell, but thought it would have more of the vanilla smell, but not..</li>
            <li> No complaints at all. The exact same smell, minus the scent of alcohol I&#x27;ve had before in the same product purchased directly from Bath and Body Works. Will buy from again.</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Perfect meets what I expected</li>
            <li> This smells so good and the smell lasts almost all day. I have received compliments from people on how good it smells. I was surprised that I was able to find this product. I wish there was an oil made from this nice smelling product. Ladies please do YOURSELF a favor and make the investment and try this very nice smelling product.</li>
            <li> Not really a vanilla that gets ones attention or lasts. No comparison to essential oils or perfumes like obsession  Just rather weak knee-ed and vague no positive feedback from others. Maybe use in a drawer to lightly scent linens or lingerie.  Not much hope for that either I don&#x27;t know what to use it for or on ..............</li>
            <li> I adore this body splash. It is a warm, sugary smell. It is very sweet. It smells exactly like Vanilla. It is pretty rich in its smell for a fragrance mist and it lasts a long time. It is not a heavy perfume. It is more of a body spritz. But I adore it. It smells so yummy and delicious. You get quite a large amount for the money. I think it is well worth it. If you love really sweet Vanilla then you will love this. I hope this helps! Pia</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle or what the deal is but there is no smell coming out of this except maybe a chemical hint that lasts about 10 seconds.  I even have a sensitive sense of smell and I love vanilla.  I feel like I bought a $10 bottle of water. I would really like my money back but return shipping will cost more than it&#x27;s worth.  Sigh.  Company should fix this/look into quality control.</li>
            <li> I use 2 sprints on my arms and one on my chest hair and run it in after shower. My girlfriend enjoys the smell when I wrap my arms around her or she nestles up next to my manpatch.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter - she loves the Vanilla Sugar Fragrance and has used it for years.  This company offered it at a great price and shipped it promptly; I would highly recommend both the fragrance and the company that sold it.</li>
            <li> Of of the best and most versatile body sprays out there, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> Althought it took a while to come..&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing , I got a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> It was a dark and stormy night.  My friend therefore had to ask me why I was wearing tanning lotion.  The thing is, I wasn&#x27;t wearing tanning lotion.  I had simply sprayed myself with with this &amp;#34;vanilla sugar&amp;#34; spray, which to my dismay, didn&#x27;t smell remotely like vanilla.  The main thing we both noticed was an eau du coconut scent, which smelled remarkably like the coconut scent in most inexpensive tanning lotions.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it wasn&#x27;t a bad scent, it just came across as being more like a toasted, sweetened coconut -- which is not what I was wanting.  The Bodycology Toasted Sugar scent is similar, but less expensive and has a bit more of a noticeable vanilla aroma.  I&#x27;ve also tried Victoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla Lace, which is the most vanilla of the three, but also smells of chemicals and alcohol.  I have ordered The Body Shop&#x27;s Vanilla Spray, which I&#x27;m hoping is better.  I&#x27;d really like to find a true vanilla scent without resorting to wearing vanilla extract.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this spray! I think I like the older type better though. The one that is in an odd shaped bottle and it sprays more on you than this one but overall,love it!</li>
            <li> Honestly I love sweet fragrance,but never been a warm vanilla sugar fan,it may be a personal thing but it smell&#x27;s like a cheap imitation baking vanilla extract, the name is to me what sells this product. If you like a very sweet vanilla smell this is for you, it just lacks a key fragrance component for me. Frankly it smells somewhat like a dollarstore bottle of extract, my opinion only.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to me I love this product so much the sad thing is that I don&#x27;t have the other stuff of warm vanilla sugar but at least I got the fragrance it smells so good it&#x27;s a really warm scenty feel to it it&#x27;s really good and I totally suggest buying this product.</li>
            <li> smells delicious great buy for a great price glad I bought two hope to see some more varieties here soon</li>
            <li> Well to start off the product is the best product it smells lovely like it can be eaten. The smell is just very divine, I always loved the fragrance ever since I was small in high school. It reminded me of the good days when I would shop with all of my high school friends. We all would go downtown and shop at bath and body works and buy a lotion and a body spray together. That smell was so delightful to my senses. It was love at first smell. There was no dislikes everything. A high recommendation is deemed upon WARM VANILLA SUGAR!!!</li>
            <li> The warm vanilla frangrance is one of my favorites, and this mister doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> LOVVVE YOU!!!!! I love the warm smell of this its nice for the casual days or the romantic days with the man ;)</li>
            <li> I came across a tube of Warm Vanilla Sugar body cream that I had forgot about, I put it on and have used it everyday since because of how sweet and subtle the smell is. The lotion wasn&#x27;t enough since I like to layer so I looked and I found the original Warm Vanilla Sugar body mist (before they changed the packaging and formula). I love the way Warm Vanilla Sugar smells, it is sweet but not overpowering just enough to make you smile. I have loved the smell of vanilla since I was little, it always comforted me somehow and even now still has the same effect. It&#x27;s perfect, I can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> I know body mists aren&#x27;t supposed to last long, but this was sad. I give it 30 mins (and that maybe a stretch). Maybe actual Bath and Body Works sprays last longer, but whatever I received was not good. Maybe it was the seller (starts with a P), but I&#x27;m disappointed. Either order from the site, go to the store, find a different seller, or keep moving.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> My granddaughter had some when visit her last month. The smell is nice not hard and lound. I would give it as a gife</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this.  Should have bought ten of the so I won&#x27;t run out anytime soon!!</li>
            <li> sweet and sugary a little more long lasting than drugstore brands</li>
            <li> beautifull bath and body works you the best</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described, good price, arrived when expected - very pleased with seller and purchase both.</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly and came brand new.  Warm vanilla sugar is one of my all time favorite B&amp;BW products. I will be using this vendor for future purchases.</li>
