            <li>I do like the intensive treatment conditioner better.</li>
            <li>I love this product, makes my hair feel silky and frizz free!</li>
            <li>For the price of the product I think it should have been shipped free of charge!</li>

            <li>Authentic product.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of the shampoo and cream rinse.  </li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It also has a great smell and is gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li>Glad to find an alternative retailer online.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo but package came with leaked shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Anyways yes I recommend this, I see a gd difference. :-)  </li>
            <li>I used to use the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo &amp; conditioner, but I think these are even better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE the shampoo, but the conditioner is just ok.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>And I love having the pump.</li>
            <li>i love this shampoo</li>
            <li>This is a great product, my hair is very soft and healthy from this product....</li>
            <li>I have long hair, it needs to be cared for to look and feel its best.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner does not spread easily in the hair.  </li>
            <li>The condition is really more of a cream rinse and at first I was unsure about it, but I loved it from the first use.  </li>
            <li>but it works well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as promised!</li>
            <li>Makes hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use them everyday and have remained happy with the results!</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>it was not sulfate free realized it after I tried it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this set is a genuine Paul Mitchell product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after getting a keratin treatment and needed a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>i choose this because it is sulfate free, after i started this shampoo</li>
            <li>The original shampoo is creamy consistency</li>
            <li>Also, this is GREAT for color treated hair - it doesn&#x27;t cause your hair to fade or dry out.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this and my hair feels clean without feeling like there is something coating my hair still.</li>
            <li>Great product for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the lather and it really does take the littlest amount.  </li>
            <li>bought portable versions because I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>love the smell of this wild ginger shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Thansk!!!</li>
            <li>Arrived rather quickly.</li>
            <li>And it arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and my hair is so soft and silky and super shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and damaged; within a week of using this product, my hair appeared and felt much healthier.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick ship!</li>
            <li>Worth it?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice something actually wrks.</li>
            <li>I have been using quality shampoos for quite some time, and I have to say that there were my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>These products are well worth what you will pay for them.....</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel thick and healthy and I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Works really well with the awapuhi treatment oil!</li>
            <li>The conditioner is just too light and does not leave my hair feeling soft and shiny, even with a Brazilian blowout.</li>
            <li>First tried this product in a salon after a color treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipper was VERY prompt!</li>
            <li>I began to get the Coppola Keratin Treatments and began to use the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo and conditioner and deep conditioner alternating it with the Coppola shampoos and conditioners and it did amazing things to my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product which I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The pumps are a really good mechanism for releasing exactly how much shampoo and conditioner you want -- in ordinary squeeze bottles I find myself using too much of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not a thick, creamy conditioner, but it definitely does as well or even better than others at removing tangles and conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the large size.  </li>
            <li>the large salon size.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the logical conclusion is that this particular seller is selling fakes somehow.</li>
            <li>My old bottles never dried out my hair and always made it feel smooth and tangle-free.</li>
            <li>It took a couple trys to finally show a difference, but it does in fact make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I have used the blonde paul mitchell line that is also sulfate free and like that much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I missed using it so much that I just had to order them.  </li>
            <li>Such a great value - it would cost double to buy these individually at a salon.</li>
            <li>Hahahaha that&#x27;s not sketchy at all.</li>
            <li>Probably my fault for not reading the description more carefully.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I was buying a product that wasn&#x27;t really doing much for my hair starts with a W.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much ....</li>
            <li>Shampoo is very sudsy</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t the real stuff</li>
            <li>I really like the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>my hair doesnt fall that much.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s totally different from the original.  </li>
            <li>Conditioner on this set smells so different from the original.  </li>
            <li>any other color safe shampoo has.  </li>
            <li>I actually got full bottles of these products as part of a research for a magazine.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit for the shampoo but a lot more for the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have short coarse hair that doesn&#x27;t respond well to most products.</li>
            <li>and it really lathers a lot while the shampoo on this set is clear liquid and does not lather as much.  </li>
            <li>But I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I had bought the normal sized bottles about a month or two ago and am seeing a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is pleasant, but very subtle and either men or women can wear it</li>
            <li>But after using about a quarter of the bottle, I had to switch to a new shampoo because it was so drying.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be trying any new shampoo and conditioner as these are everything I could want.  </li>
            <li>I live in an area with a dryer climate and these products</li>
            <li>Smells so good, and one pump from both the shampoo and conditioner are enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Smells heavenly and is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>Especially if you use the whole line and do the treatment.</li>
            <li>I have used this product, bought directly from a salon, for two years.</li>
            <li>If you have color treated or processed hair that is styled frequently, this seems to make up for all of the harm caused.  </li>
            <li>When I wash and condition at home I never get the soft silliness that I get at the salon.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair alive again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29yrs old now.</li>
            <li>Now its soft and silky</li>
            <li>However, when I received the package, both the shampoo and conditioner was completely leaking.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner, however, makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny I spent.</li>
            <li>I live in a winter wonderland full of forced hot air constantly.  </li>
            <li>When I began using this my hair was very damaged from chemo medications and antibiotics that I had to use long term.</li>
            <li>The sulfate-free shampoo scared me at first - makes your hair feel stripped while it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li>I picked this combo due to it being sulfate-free and animal-testing free, but there are similar products out there that I like just as much, especially when talking about the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Recommended to me by a high end stylist &amp; salon owner - I have wavy mid length hair with heavy highlights, this product was a real changer for my hair and natural style.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need to use much, so the liter-sizes do last quite a long time.</li>
            <li>Now I understand why they say to only buy from a professional salon.</li>
            <li>After washing I work the rinse through with my wide pick and clip my hair up leaving the rinse on while showering, no additional work on the hair, no combing, brushing or styling, when the towel comes off apply a little light product and go, big soft loose natural waves.</li>
            <li>My hair is now back to being long, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and was spending a fortune at the salon buying this product in the smaller size every month.</li>
            <li>The water where I live is extremely &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; and was damaging my hair.  </li>

            <li> it was not sulfate free realized it after I tried it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this set is a genuine Paul Mitchell product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after getting a keratin treatment and needed a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> i choose this because it is sulfate free, after i started this shampoo</li>
            <li> The original shampoo is creamy consistency</li>
            <li> Also, this is GREAT for color treated hair - it doesn&#x27;t cause your hair to fade or dry out.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this and my hair feels clean without feeling like there is something coating my hair still.</li>
            <li> Great product for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the lather and it really does take the littlest amount.  </li>
            <li> bought portable versions because I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this wild ginger shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Thansk!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived rather quickly.</li>
            <li> And it arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and my hair is so soft and silky and super shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and damaged; within a week of using this product, my hair appeared and felt much healthier.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick ship!</li>
            <li> Worth it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice something actually wrks.</li>
            <li> I have been using quality shampoos for quite some time, and I have to say that there were my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> These products are well worth what you will pay for them.....</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel thick and healthy and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Works really well with the awapuhi treatment oil!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is just too light and does not leave my hair feeling soft and shiny, even with a Brazilian blowout.</li>
            <li> First tried this product in a salon after a color treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipper was VERY prompt!</li>
            <li> I began to get the Coppola Keratin Treatments and began to use the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo and conditioner and deep conditioner alternating it with the Coppola shampoos and conditioners and it did amazing things to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product which I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The pumps are a really good mechanism for releasing exactly how much shampoo and conditioner you want -- in ordinary squeeze bottles I find myself using too much of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not a thick, creamy conditioner, but it definitely does as well or even better than others at removing tangles and conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the large size.  </li>
            <li> the large salon size.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the logical conclusion is that this particular seller is selling fakes somehow.</li>
            <li> My old bottles never dried out my hair and always made it feel smooth and tangle-free.</li>
            <li> It took a couple trys to finally show a difference, but it does in fact make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I have used the blonde paul mitchell line that is also sulfate free and like that much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I missed using it so much that I just had to order them.  </li>
            <li> Such a great value - it would cost double to buy these individually at a salon.</li>
            <li> Hahahaha that&#x27;s not sketchy at all.</li>
            <li> Probably my fault for not reading the description more carefully.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was buying a product that wasn&#x27;t really doing much for my hair starts with a W.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much ....</li>
            <li> Shampoo is very sudsy</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the real stuff</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> my hair doesnt fall that much.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s totally different from the original.  </li>
            <li> Conditioner on this set smells so different from the original.  </li>
            <li> any other color safe shampoo has.  </li>
            <li> I actually got full bottles of these products as part of a research for a magazine.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit for the shampoo but a lot more for the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have short coarse hair that doesn&#x27;t respond well to most products.</li>
            <li> and it really lathers a lot while the shampoo on this set is clear liquid and does not lather as much.  </li>
            <li> But I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I had bought the normal sized bottles about a month or two ago and am seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is pleasant, but very subtle and either men or women can wear it</li>
            <li> But after using about a quarter of the bottle, I had to switch to a new shampoo because it was so drying.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be trying any new shampoo and conditioner as these are everything I could want.  </li>
            <li> I live in an area with a dryer climate and these products</li>
            <li> Smells so good, and one pump from both the shampoo and conditioner are enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Especially if you use the whole line and do the treatment.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, bought directly from a salon, for two years.</li>
            <li> If you have color treated or processed hair that is styled frequently, this seems to make up for all of the harm caused.  </li>
            <li> When I wash and condition at home I never get the soft silliness that I get at the salon.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair alive again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29yrs old now.</li>
            <li> Now its soft and silky</li>
            <li> However, when I received the package, both the shampoo and conditioner was completely leaking.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner, however, makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny I spent.</li>
            <li> I live in a winter wonderland full of forced hot air constantly.  </li>
            <li> When I began using this my hair was very damaged from chemo medications and antibiotics that I had to use long term.</li>
            <li> The sulfate-free shampoo scared me at first - makes your hair feel stripped while it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li> I picked this combo due to it being sulfate-free and animal-testing free, but there are similar products out there that I like just as much, especially when talking about the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by a high end stylist &amp; salon owner - I have wavy mid length hair with heavy highlights, this product was a real changer for my hair and natural style.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need to use much, so the liter-sizes do last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Now I understand why they say to only buy from a professional salon.</li>
            <li> After washing I work the rinse through with my wide pick and clip my hair up leaving the rinse on while showering, no additional work on the hair, no combing, brushing or styling, when the towel comes off apply a little light product and go, big soft loose natural waves.</li>
            <li> My hair is now back to being long, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and was spending a fortune at the salon buying this product in the smaller size every month.</li>
            <li> The water where I live is extremely &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; and was damaging my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit... quarter size washes long hair and</li>
            <li> But by far NOT worth what I paid!</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and brittle, I use a flat iron a lot.  </li>
            <li> been using a long time</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very thin and didnt seem to condition or smooth my hair at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit pricey, but it lasts a really long time because of the pump mechanism!</li>
            <li> As an eczema sufferer for years, I would try an endless number of shampoos then use prescription foam on my scalp to mitigate the inevitable itching, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair, even in the shower while using it, feels dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my dry hair from the weather.</li>
            <li> She said that it works well for people with really dry itch and cracking scalp because it has no phosphates.  </li>
            <li> and it definitely was not the same caliber of shampoo/product that I had received in the past.  </li>
            <li> These products combined strengthens and moisturizes my hair even in very dry climates.  </li>
            <li> and I only use a little bit</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> A little bit I believe goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I also was worried since the picture of shows the big bottles but the description says the small bottles.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s due to hair dyes ect..</li>
            <li> (Compared to the other duo liters I have purchased).</li>
            <li> There are no more words necessary to describe the glory of this product.</li>
            <li> not much more conditioner does the same.</li>
            <li> have long hair and all i need is a few pumps of this shampoo in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, little bit of breakage.</li>
            <li> I recently had the Keratin Complex treatment</li>
            <li> I am simply addicted to the way my hair feels since I&#x27;ve been using Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo and Keratin Cream Rinse, which is well over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before this shampoo i tried the Paul Mitchell special tree oil shampoo, which wasnt bad.</li>
            <li> understand that this is a luxury item, not a necessity, but I am grateful that I can afford a little luxury in my life from time to time.</li>
            <li> Cracking, bleeding.. scratched up scalp, huge bloody scabs.  </li>
            <li> and I use this shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li> I get that everyone has differing sensitivities to products and one size does not fit all.  </li>
            <li> so you use very little.  </li>
            <li> I know what the shampoo is supposed to do to my hair, having used it for the past two years.</li>
            <li> However I was too lazy to return</li>
            <li> I have thin &amp;#34;Skinny&amp;#34; hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Im really disappointed in this product, unfortunately its hard to find any sulfate free products that make my hair manageable.  </li>
            <li> really believe this is just overpriced crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how, it just works!</li>
            <li> It is very pricey, I was really disappointed in the shipping charges, they were ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Its a bit less expensive then if you were to walk into a salon and purchase it.</li>
            <li> That or I just got hold of a bad batch, but seeing other people say it dries their hair out as well makes me suspect foul play.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting the no sulfites version of this product, so I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of buying it off of amazon..</li>
            <li> how expensive they were before I used them.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY!</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten very thin.</li>
            <li> The bottles were just haphazardly thrown into a box and shipped.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> and they were really REALLY bad.  </li>
            <li> Too bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo smells great! But by far NOT worth what I paid!</li>
            <li> I have tried this shampoo before in a smaller size.  I missed using it so much that I just had to order them.  I love the lather and it really does take the littlest amount.  The condition is really more of a cream rinse and at first I was unsure about it, but I loved it from the first use.  It is not a thick, creamy conditioner, but it definitely does as well or even better than others at removing tangles and conditioning my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure how, it just works!</li>
            <li> PM&#x27;s Awapuhi Wild Ginger keratin line is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my hair, even though I can&#x27;t pronounce awapuhi without soundling like I&#x27;m trying to say something perverse.  My hair is fine and damaged; within a week of using this product, my hair appeared and felt much healthier. I wasn&#x27;t the only one that noticed--my husband and coworkers also noted and commented on my hair&#x27;s improvement.  The only drawback is the price, but I try to view it as an investment rather than an indulgence.</li>
            <li> The set of shampoo and conditioner work so well. I love them. I recently had the Keratin Complex treatment and I use this shampoo everyday. I love it and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> My favorite stuff!  Smells heavenly and is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Fair price good condition came quckly</li>
            <li> love it and would re order</li>
            <li> Love this product! Smells so good, and one pump from both the shampoo and conditioner are enough for my thick hair. I do try and let the conditioner set for a minute or two before washing off though.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo/conditioner!  Such a great value - it would cost double to buy these individually at a salon. It&#x27;s lasted me quite a while, and I feel like I use A LOT. Also, this is GREAT for color treated hair - it doesn&#x27;t cause your hair to fade or dry out.</li>
            <li> The best Paul Mitchell product. Brings your hair back to life. Especially if you use the whole line and do the treatment. Makes hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, my hair is very soft and healthy from this product....I was skeptical of buying it off of amazon.. but to my surprise it was a great buy! Its a bit less expensive then if you were to walk into a salon and purchase it. and I also was worried since the picture of shows the big bottles but the description says the small bottles. IT IS THE BIG LITER BOTTLES!!! LOVE IT!!!Definitely will be buying this product again!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love the smell.  But after using about a quarter of the bottle, I had to switch to a new shampoo because it was so drying.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> This hair product makes my hair feel or seem thicker!  I use them everyday and have remained happy with the results!</li>
            <li> These products combined strengthens and moisturizes my hair even in very dry climates.  Works really well with the awapuhi treatment oil!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as promised!</li>
            <li> I have used this product, bought directly from a salon, for two years. When I ran out this last time, I decided to save some money by ordering online. I know what the shampoo is supposed to do to my hair, having used it for the past two years. My old bottles never dried out my hair and always made it feel smooth and tangle-free. This stuff, whatever it is, does not. My hair, even in the shower while using it, feels dry and tangled. Nothing about my hair or water or anything else has changed so I feel like the logical conclusion is that this particular seller is selling fakes somehow. That or I just got hold of a bad batch, but seeing other people say it dries their hair out as well makes me suspect foul play. Also, under the \\&quot;features\\&quot; section the last bullet says \\&quot;Guaranteed real!!!\\&quot; Hahahaha that&#x27;s not sketchy at all. I recommend the product wholeheartedly but for duck&#x27;s sake buy it from somebody else. Edit: Seller was Sarrina Beauty.</li>
            <li> been using a long time</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I have been using it since I got them and will continue in the future.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. I have been using this for over a year. Really keeps my hair in great shape. I do like the intensive treatment conditioner better. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, makes my hair feel silky and frizz free! It is very pricey, I was really disappointed in the shipping charges, they were ridiculous! For the price of the product I think it should have been shipped free of charge!</li>
            <li> Thank you for carrying the liter size in a duo. This stuff is AWESOME! It makes your hair feel thick and healthy and I love the smell! The only drawback is the price. The liters help with that.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting the no sulfites version of this product, so I&#x27;m a little disappointed. Probably my fault for not reading the description more carefully.</li>
            <li> I have thin &amp;#34;Skinny&amp;#34; hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. It smells great and is sulfate free so it doesn&#x27;t strip my color.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner.  You only need a tiny bit for the shampoo but a lot more for the conditioner.  The conditioner does not spread easily in the hair.  I have very long hair.  But I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I chose this product on the recommendation of a stylist.  The water where I live is extremely &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; and was damaging my hair.  The Awapuhi duo, along with the Keratin treatment, have made a big difference.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shampoo and conditioner for hair that could use some pampering.  If you have color treated or processed hair that is styled frequently, this seems to make up for all of the harm caused.  The smell is heavenly!  I don&#x27;t think I will be trying any new shampoo and conditioner as these are everything I could want.  The condition of my hair has improved since I started using these.</li>
            <li> I actually got full bottles of these products as part of a research for a magazine. I had no idea how expensive they were before I used them.  I have short coarse hair that doesn&#x27;t respond well to most products. When I wash and condition at home I never get the soft silliness that I get at the salon. These products did it for me though!  My hair is soft. silky, and shiny.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and brittle, I use a flat iron a lot.  This stuff makes my hair alive again.</li>
            <li> Love it and the packaging was great!</li>
            <li> Best price around.  Authentic product.  I love the smell of the shampoo and cream rinse.  Great duo pair. Fast shipping.  Trust this sell. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I have super thick hair and was spending a fortune at the salon buying this product in the smaller size every month.</li>
            <li> Wonderful products. Love the scent, love the texture of my hair after using.</li>
            <li> Great price. Arrived rather quickly. Love this product.Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It has keratin in it which is great for shine and frizz.  It also has a great smell and is gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s salon turned her onto this product, and she especially likes the rinse product, but if we had to pay the salon prices to keep using it, we wouldn&#x27;t.  Glad to find an alternative retailer online.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo but package came with leaked shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> had to return ..received only shampoo</li>
            <li> I am simply addicted to the way my hair feels since I&#x27;ve been using Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo and Keratin Cream Rinse, which is well over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, yes. Worth it? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that this is a luxury item, not a necessity, but I am grateful that I can afford a little luxury in my life from time to time. I have long hair, it needs to be cared for to look and feel its best.  This set of products is the best I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use much, so the liter-sizes do last quite a long time. The pump-bottle design is quite good also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant, but very subtle and either men or women can wear it (I am the former).</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, little bit of breakage. I was buying a product that wasn&#x27;t really doing much for my hair starts with a W. I canceled the shipments. And got this. Very happy. I&#x27;m very cheap but honestly my hair needs something that will nourish it. I had bought the normal sized bottles about a month or two ago and am seeing a difference. It&#x27;s nice something actually wrks. I&#x27;m also taking vitamins, and not coloring my hair. A little bit I believe goes a long way. I use this twice a wk. And a deep conditioner w this shampoo the 2 time. My hair has gotten very thin. I&#x27;m 29yrs old now. I think it&#x27;s due to hair dyes ect.. Anyways yes I recommend this, I see a gd difference. :-)  hope this helps..</li>
            <li> I used to use the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo &amp; conditioner, but I think these are even better.</li>
            <li> This product smells great!! I have been using quality shampoos for quite some time, and I have to say that there were my favorite so far. I absolutely love the scent. The pumps are a really good mechanism for releasing exactly how much shampoo and conditioner you want -- in ordinary squeeze bottles I find myself using too much of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought portable versions because I love this product so much. My hair is healthier and softer after using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey, but it lasts a really long time because of the pump mechanism! (Compared to the other duo liters I have purchased).</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Great packaging!</li>
            <li> stick with regukar Awapuhi at is the best product , the ginger at good addition was not a positive at all</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. Best shampoo and conditioner in all the land. There are no more words necessary to describe the glory of this product.</li>
            <li> These are THE BEST PRODUCTS I have ever used on my hair. A tiny bit... quarter size washes long hair and not much more conditioner does the same. These products are well worth what you will pay for them.....And the smell is devine !</li>
            <li> Before this shampoo i tried the Paul Mitchell special tree oil shampoo, which wasnt bad. However,&lt;br /&gt;after trying the awapuwi, i must say, it left my hair feeling better.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the big bottle and it lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and all i need is a few pumps of this shampoo in my hair.</li>
            <li> i love the shampoo, cleans well and great for my hair</li>
            <li> Product came on time great pricing. My hairdresser used this on my dry hair from the weather. Now its soft and silky</li>
            <li> I love this product. It made my hair look sooo good after just one wash.  Worth every penny I spent.</li>
            <li> Expensive but it works well with my fine hair. Light.</li>
            <li> Best. Shampoo. Ever. And it arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Both shampoo and conditioner are great. My hairdresser recommended this and my hair feels clean without feeling like there is something coating my hair still.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real deal.  The printing on the label was not lined up, which makes me think that this was a knock-off and it definitely was not the same caliber of shampoo/product that I had received in the past.  Would not buy again from this company.</li>
            <li> i loved the work of the Amazon and very good Producy Paul Mitchell Awapuchi Wild Shampoo.Thank you so much ....</li>
            <li> LOVE the shampoo, but the conditioner is just ok. I picked this combo due to it being sulfate-free and animal-testing free, but there are similar products out there that I like just as much, especially when talking about the conditioner. The conditioner is just too light and does not leave my hair feeling soft and shiny, even with a Brazilian blowout.</li>
            <li> Total rip off only received shampoo, no conditioner!!!!</li>
            <li> it was not sulfate free realized it after I tried it</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this product and now I&#x27;m hooked!  Great product,it leaves my hair clean, shiny and healthy looking. I would definitely recommend these products</li>
            <li> Great product for my dry hair.  Love it! Shampoo is very sudsy so you use very little.  The conditioner is actually repairing my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product which I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  However, when I received the package, both the shampoo and conditioner was completely leaking.  The bottles were just haphazardly thrown into a box and shipped.  Won&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> First tried this product in a salon after a color treatment. The sulfate-free shampoo scared me at first - makes your hair feel stripped while it&#x27;s still wet. The conditioner, however, makes it soft and manageable. This was after having bleach and color on my hair for 3 hours with a level 20 developer!! It&#x27;s like silk!!</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by my hair dresser.  She said that it works well for people with really dry itch and cracking scalp because it has no phosphates.  I tried it.  It took a couple trys to finally show a difference, but it does in fact make a huge difference.  I live in a winter wonderland full of forced hot air constantly.  This cleared up any issues I had with my head.. and they were really REALLY bad.  Cracking, bleeding.. scratched up scalp, huge bloody scabs.  This is the best stuff ever.  Worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Fast shipment.  The bottles did come open during shipment and some spilled.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this wild ginger shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Thansk!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It helps my hair shine, gives it body and nourishes it! And - it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was VERY prompt! I had to contact them about one thing - and they immediately contacted me, answered and exceeded my expectations! Awesome customer service!!</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by a high end stylist &amp; salon owner - I have wavy mid length hair with heavy highlights, this product was a real changer for my hair and natural style.  After washing I work the rinse through with my wide pick and clip my hair up leaving the rinse on while showering, no additional work on the hair, no combing, brushing or styling, when the towel comes off apply a little light product and go, big soft loose natural waves.</li>
            <li> Received two shampoos! I was suppose to receive one shampoo &amp; one conditioner as advertised. NOT HAPPY! Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> This item consist of shampoo and conditioner. But I recieved 2 rinses. However I was too lazy to return this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please, give attention to goods next time.</li>
            <li> I bought the boxed set (shampoo, cream rinse and keratin treatment) 3 months ago.  Just bought this shampoo &amp; conditioner set and it&#x27;s totally different from the original.  The original shampoo is creamy consistency and I only use a little bit and it really lathers a lot while the shampoo on this set is clear liquid and does not lather as much.  Conditioner on this set smells so different from the original.  I don&#x27;t think this set is a genuine Paul Mitchell product.  Too bad I ordered the large size.  Will not order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the real stuff</li>
            <li> This wonderful smelling shampoo is really nice for my hair.  I am 56 with color treated hair and this shampoo is a keeper.  As an eczema sufferer for years, I would try an endless number of shampoos then use prescription foam on my scalp to mitigate the inevitable itching, etc.  I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree, Wen, ColorProof, Nexxus, Pureology, Aveda, DHC and so on which currently sit in my shampoo boneyard in my closet.  I get that everyone has differing sensitivities to products and one size does not fit all.  But after 15 years of trying to get rid of scalp issues with various products, this is it.  It smells great, leaves my hair nice and preserves my color as well as any other color safe shampoo has.  I hope that others buy this product and have as great an experience with it as I have.</li>
            <li> Great price, speedy delivery:)</li>
            <li> Makes your hair silky and shiny and it smells great!!  I have already noticed a difference in my hair - which is color treated.</li>
            <li> Now I understand why they say to only buy from a professional salon. Product definitely was NOT the same quality and ended up throwing it away. Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Product did not have the same consistency/color as what I have purchased from my salon...</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo! And it came a lot quicker then I was told!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of shampoo and conditioners since 2010 and I love it. I use the shampoo, regular conditioner and the deep conditioner. I use the deep conditioner once a week. I love how it smells and my hair is so soft and silky and super shiny. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this product for it to work. And I love having the pump. When I began using this my hair was very damaged from chemo medications and antibiotics that I had to use long term. My hair looked like it had been zapped. I began to get the Coppola Keratin Treatments and began to use the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo and conditioner and deep conditioner alternating it with the Coppola shampoos and conditioners and it did amazing things to my hair. My hair is now back to being long, soft and shiny.  I never get build-up from it or feel like I have to change brands, but I do alternate it with Coppola brand shampoo and conditioner, so that could be why.  Both brands are good for Keratin treated hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo and conditioner. They work great! I live in an area with a dryer climate and these products help to hydrate.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after getting a keratin treatment and needed a sulfate free shampoo. I have used the blonde paul mitchell line that is also sulfate free and like that much better.&lt;br /&gt;I really believe this is just overpriced crap. The shampoo lathers nicely but feel like it dries out my hair, almost stripping it. The conditioner is very thin and didnt seem to condition or smooth my hair at all. Im really disappointed in this product, unfortunately its hard to find any sulfate free products that make my hair manageable.  I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Came on time as promised!  LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for....the large salon size.  Thanks for the quick ship!</li>
            <li> i choose this because it is sulfate free, after i started this shampoo my hair doesnt fall that much. i love this shampoo</li>
