            <li>However, it is amazing when it comes to removing makeup.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>I find this to be effective by using it</li>
            <li>This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve found to manage my 40 year old blemished skin.</li>
            <li>I love this face was and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted for an amazing price!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Great value on my favorite facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It is much more creamy than I thought it would be, but it cleans very nicely and leaves my skin fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>And it delivered so quickly!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling very clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This multi-pack is as good as a price per unit as I&#x27;ve found in any local store.</li>
            <li>followed with a simple witch hazel toner at night or after a good aerobic workout.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly new to my skin yet but it does even seem to be doing a better job for me with the blemish aspect than Proactiv did.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Also I seem to have the worlds most sensitive skin and every product I seem to use makes me have an allergic reaction, but this product did not do that!</li>
            <li>Love how soft my skin feels combined with the day and night lotion.</li>
            <li>and I find that it does a nice job of working on rejuvenating my skin for a fresher, younger looking appearance.</li>
            <li>This is the only skin cleanser I&#x27;ve used for many years.</li>
            <li>It is very slippery and will slip right off of your fingers or hands.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel wicked clean and soft while keeping breakouts at bay.</li>
            <li>I washed everything off easily, without leaving a shadow of mascara behind like some soap can, I love it!</li>
            <li>Wonderful cleanser, especially when you use in conjunction with other Neutrogena products, such as moisturizers and serums.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, been using it for quite a few years now, great smell, feels really clean, I love the wrinkle/blemish combo, not many products do that, they are either way to heavy for wrinkles or very drying for blemishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 and have fine lines as well as occasional blemishes.</li>
            <li>has really helped my &amp;#34;senior acne issues&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It also works very well on blemishes (acne etc)  without over drying my skin</li>
            <li>I also find this can happen if you are using it with too much water running in the sink.</li>
            <li>This does not dry out your skin, it&#x27;s perfectly balanced to keep your skin clear from blemishes and wrinkles, just like it&#x27;s named, plus it is very inexpensive and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>As far as its use for treating wrinkles, I haven&#x27;t seen anything evident to support it.  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely, clean smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Good value since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at that, since I assumed that the product would be very drying.</li>
            <li>It will dry up surface oils and leave your skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>My one remark on the down side is that if you plan on using this in the shower like I do, make sure to keep it away from the direct water flow.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s, prone to breakouts and still want to prevent aging.  </li>
            <li>Only a small dollop of this cleanser is needed to effectively wash your entire face, forehead, chin and neck area as it lathers up quite a bit for a cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 37 year old female with adult onset of acne.  </li>
            <li>This actually does work well to keep down breakouts on oily skin and keeps my facial skin smooth too.</li>
            <li>It reduces the occurrences of blackheads and other blemishes, and yet leaves my skin very soft.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great value on my favorite facial cleanser. I&#x27;m 40 and have fine lines as well as occasional blemishes. This makes my skin feel wicked clean and soft while keeping breakouts at bay.</li>
            <li> My favorite company, Neutrogena, has the most awesome cleansers.  As I have entered my mid-thirties, I have found this one to be the best for me.  I definitely recommend giving this product a try.  Wonderful cleanser, especially when you use in conjunction with other Neutrogena products, such as moisturizers and serums.</li>

            <li> Great for every day use!</li>
            <li> One of only two face products that I routinely purchase; works as promised.</li>
            <li> has really helped my &amp;#34;senior acne issues&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This actually does work well to keep down breakouts on oily skin and keeps my facial skin smooth too.</li>
            <li> Love how soft my skin feels combined with the day and night lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years now.  I just turned 49 and everyone always asks me why I have no wrinkles yet!!  I&#x27;ve actually gotten carded recently.  This does not dry out your skin, it&#x27;s perfectly balanced to keep your skin clear from blemishes and wrinkles, just like it&#x27;s named, plus it is very inexpensive and a little goes a long way.  I love it.!</li>
            <li> My skin looks great and no zits. Nuff said. at 41, I still get zits, yeah. This prevents those.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash!</li>
            <li> Its difficult to find products that are both anti-aging and anti-acne (oh blessed are we that need both).  I love this face was and have been using it for years.  This multi-pack is as good as a price per unit as I&#x27;ve found in any local store.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the smell, I&#x27;ve been using the product without fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make in USA of domestic and foreign parts.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for 7 years.  I am in my early 30&#x27;s, prone to breakouts and still want to prevent aging.  My teenage daughter even uses this.  Cleanses well without over drying.</li>
            <li> need to keep this product.  hard to find</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t put an end to my wrinkles or to my acne (induced by my period every month, nothing can stop it). However, it is amazing when it comes to removing makeup. I washed everything off easily, without leaving a shadow of mascara behind like some soap can, I love it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for an amazing price! And it delivered so quickly! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I think I found a winner.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.  It leaves your skin feeling very clean and fresh.  It&#x27;s almost softer than when I used to moisturize.  It&#x27;s fairly new to my skin yet but it does even seem to be doing a better job for me with the blemish aspect than Proactiv did.  I&#x27;ll keep buying this and keep note of the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It is much more creamy than I thought it would be, but it cleans very nicely and leaves my skin fresh and soft. It also works very well on blemishes (acne etc)  without over drying my skin and I find that it does a nice job of working on rejuvenating my skin for a fresher, younger looking appearance. Also I seem to have the worlds most sensitive skin and every product I seem to use makes me have an allergic reaction, but this product did not do that!

            <li> This is the only skin cleanser I&#x27;ve used for many years. It reduces the occurrences of blackheads and other blemishes, and yet leaves my skin very soft. I was surprised at that, since I assumed that the product would be very drying. It isn&#x27;t! I do finish up with a Neutrogena moisturizer, but I attribute the increased clarity and smoothness of my skin to the Anti-Wrinkle, Anti-Blemish cleanser.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Smooths my skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 37 year old female with adult onset of acne.  It&#x27;s very hard to find something that&#x27;s going to fight the acne and the wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve only used this for 2 weeks, no new breakouts have popped up so for now.  Very pleasant fragrance and I like the lather it creates.</li>
            <li> Only a small dollop of this cleanser is needed to effectively wash your entire face, forehead, chin and neck area as it lathers up quite a bit for a cream.  It doesn&#x27;t have any added fragrance or medicated odor like some acne cleansers.  It will dry up surface oils and leave your skin feeling clean.  Those with sensitive skin may be a little &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; for a just a few minutes after use.  I find this to be effective by using it followed with a simple witch hazel toner at night or after a good aerobic workout.  As far as its use for treating wrinkles, I haven&#x27;t seen anything evident to support it.  Good value since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only facial cleanser I buy. Perfect for combination skin and I have always heard to start anti-aging skincare early,nip it in the bud.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, been using it for quite a few years now, great smell, feels really clean, I love the wrinkle/blemish combo, not many products do that, they are either way to heavy for wrinkles or very drying for blemishes. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Great deal! Excellent Seller!!</li>
