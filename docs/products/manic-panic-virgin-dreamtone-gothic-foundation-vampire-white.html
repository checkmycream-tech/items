            <li>Great to mix with foundations to make them lighter without sheering then out</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This is GREAT for mixing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy my face is no longer orange</li>
            <li>Seller was great.</li>
            <li>this is amazing it perfectly blends in with your skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is Amazing!</li>
            <li>This comes in handy!</li>
            <li>The perfect shade for my lovely paper like skin.</li>
            <li>When used correctly, this product works beautifully and it can even impart a nice lunar glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t go on totally smooth and flawless.  </li>
            <li>I have the \\&quot;pregnancy mask\\&quot; going on, even though I&#x27;m naturally fair skinned.</li>
            <li>It took a surprising amount to lighten it to the correct shade (about 1/4 of a bottle), but it did its job.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good as a primer, and mixes well with colored foundation to adjust the shade, however.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really fair</li>
            <li>This product is good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively fair, but I like to look spooky.</li>
            <li>This is great for costume makeup on its own or to lighten the color another foundation.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t make the foundation magically fit me perfectly.</li>
            <li>Pros: blends perfectly with another liquid foundation for a smooth gothic look.</li>
            <li>Great product, I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Great product, perfect consistency, high quality.</li>
            <li>product is a great price and has outstanding quality and results.</li>
            <li>But, the more you experiment and work with it, it can find a great place in your collection.</li>
            <li>but I am so fair that I could wear it on its own but struggle to even it out.</li>
            <li>i mix this with my foundation because none are the right shade for me, this makes my skin not look like i smeared my face with dorito residue :D</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li>Did not blend with my foundation at all...like mixing oil and water even though my foundation is oil free!?!</li>
            <li>This is perfect to add to my foundations to lighten them instead of buying 2 shades (can become costly when you buy higher end foundations).</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>I would not wear this on its own -</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t change the foundations&#x27; finishes or consistencies too much either which is excellent.</li>
            <li>The results were astounding.</li>
            <li>Warm Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to stay well, which is nice.</li>
            <li>nice when u mix w ur foundation</li>
            <li>Also really great for special effects/costume makeup.</li>
            <li>I mix it with my normal foundation to get the perfect shade I need</li>
            <li>If your very fair it would be great for a regular foundation.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does what it say it is, amazing!!</li>
            <li>It dispenses out of the pump very easily.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned, so finding a foundation that works for me is a bit of a challenge,  even when purchasing the absolute lightest color.</li>
            <li>offers some coverage, and the service was great!</li>
            <li>Great for Halloween &amp; costume make-up, but excellent at lightening a foundation that is too dark for my porcelain skin tone.</li>
            <li>This paired with any foundation is amazing because you can get it as light as you need!</li>
            <li>This product is great to make ANY foundation that&#x27;s too dark for you match your skin perfectly!</li>
            <li>I very lightly brush it over my face and it gives me a nice matte flawless look without looking too white (my skin tone is medium).</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s very important to BLENNNNNNNNDDD</li>
            <li>This must be a new formula or something because it goes on so smoothly and covers wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I got this to go with my manic panic gothic vampire powder since I have a gothic side its perfect for the days I go all gothic its a great product also hard to find here in texas</li>
            <li>This is meant to be mixed with foundations to lighten them, and it does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li>Applying it was ok</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this</li>
            <li>I add a tiny bit to my BB cream and it matches my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>We used this foundation and it works so much better then</li>
            <li>I needed something to lighten my current foundation to match my skin and this does a great job!</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mix it at more than a 50:50 ratio.  </li>
            <li>ended up purchasing the Mehron white makeup and that worked perfect.</li>
            <li>I do tend to have more oily skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I will purchase again before I run out and would recommend to all the light skin beauties out there!</li>
            <li>so I also used the Manic Panic &amp;#34;Goth White&amp;#34; Powder Cream Foundation which worked 100% better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but if your just looking to light up your foundation mixing this will help amazingly c:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have a yellowish/light olive undertone; this stuff helps lighten the undertones in my foundation to finally make a perfect match.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Wish I did this sooner :)</li>
            <li>Now it won&#x27;t spoil from contamination. :]</li>
            <li>So much better than stage clown make up.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite consistency...</li>
            <li>I also use some translucent powder to go on top so that it doesn&#x27;t darken the color.</li>
            <li>but i care more about service.</li>
            <li>but i hope you guys get better attitude on products.</li>
            <li>This is not a foundation but more like primer.</li>
            <li>A child&#x27;s water paints would have been better, although still not the way to go.  </li>
            <li>My favorite foundation (Kat Von D&#x27;s lock-it tattoo foundation in 44)</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s outrageously better than it was before, but it&#x27;s still not &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This product also did not cause any breakouts (for me personally) and doubles as a great eyeshadow primer!</li>
            <li>mine came with a dauber top.</li>
            <li>:) Unscented.  </li>
            <li>Because of this I have had to start undoing the top and skipping the pump altogether.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-May review again when I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty pleased with the product and VERY pleased with the seller/service/shipping&lt;br /&gt;Buy from Fatal Impact</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, goes on silky smooth. :)</li>
            <li>and I have never been able to find a foundation that is as light as my skin tone.</li>
            <li>In the couple of weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it, it works great so far.</li>
            <li>However, it arrived in perfect condition and the foundation arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>it ends up looking less awesome and more streaky.  </li>
            <li>I add a little of this to my favorite foundation and it gives me the perfect color.</li>
            <li>It works best with other liquid foundations</li>
            <li>It is suitable for someone with very fair skin to either mix with a foundation that is too dark, or to use alone.</li>
            <li>Washes off really easy.</li>
            <li>for fair skin, correcting tone in foundations&lt;br /&gt;-Feels light, very build-able coverage&lt;br /&gt;-Really</li>
            <li>This does have a satin kind of finish which is okay, but it seems like it makes my makeup have a more natural look!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it changed the texture of my foundation formula, if anything it made it a tad bit more full coverage.</li>
            <li>Good texture and is relatively light with decent coverage.</li>
            <li>how quickly it came in the mail!</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and it&#x27;s lightweight.</li>
            <li>and i felt it just was too light.</li>
            <li>I use this as a shade deluiter with my Kat Von D light 44 foundation.</li>
            <li>I now use light 42 but while I was waiting for my replacement I realized how well this works in that capacity.</li>
            <li>I have fairly light skin</li>
            <li>The look is great for my vampire costume and also my Snow White costume.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and not caked.</li>
            <li>Dont settle for something like this that looks like cheap party makeup.</li>
            <li>Maybelline fit me); it&#x27;s like mixing oil and water together.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s silky smooth, and doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
            <li>So in order to even out the shade of my foundation and have it perfectly fit my skin, I purchased this.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural and feels so good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Perfect for pale princesses.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it though, quite a life saver!!</li>
            <li>Its also a great white foundation for Halloween for make up transformations and special fx purposes.</li>
            <li>It comes with a pump, which is super convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product to mix with my foundations to lighten them instead of having to buy a a new bottle of a different shade and it works great for that!</li>
            <li>So, I bought this product, excited that I may have solved the problem.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to change the texture or finish of the original finish.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am very happy with this and definitely will repurchase once i run out of my current one :)</li>
            <li>I bought this because us fair skinned people can never find a foundation shade light enough.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty great product to mix with a liquid foundation that isn&#x27;t light enough for those cooler tone girlies out there.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this by itself, but it works beautifully to lighten up other foundations.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s really not too oily, which is great news for my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the white make up disaster, I would have had a really good costume.  </li>
            <li>Haha, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>It feels very lightweight, even with powder on top, and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this product and how fast it shipped to me.</li>
            <li>Just keep blending until it&#x27;s smooth and then apply to your beautiful pale face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mix a small amount with my foundation to get the right color - it works great!</li>
            <li>What I did to make the coverage more even was add a bit of regular ivory foundation in with the Manic Panic to create a more opaque foundation.</li>
            <li>I have used it in several different kinds of foundation and brands and it works great!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t quite cover my (caucasian) skin tone adequately</li>
            <li>Great for people who spray tan and who&#x27;s skin is constantly changing colors, people who are much paler in the winter then in the summer, and people who want to take their foundation whiter for a goth look.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a light enough foundation on its own before grabbing this.</li>
            <li>I use this to actually mix in with my &amp;#34;MAC Studio fix fluid nw13&amp;#34; to achieve my perfect shade.</li>
            <li>Then I applied manic panic virgin white pressed powder and got the perfect gothic white look I was trying to achieve.</li>
            <li>It is suitable for sensitive, rosacea prone skin.</li>
            <li>I used this for a cosplay and it was helpful but it needed assistance in becoming really opaque on skin.</li>
            <li>Works great for mixing into foundations that are too dark.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m sure you could use this, especially with the powder, as a regular foundation (light coverage), I find it works best to use it with a regular foundation to lighten the color.</li>
            <li>My makeup is an exact match to my skin now!</li>
            <li>Absolutely would recommend!!</li>
            <li>It was way too much money for something that didn&#x27;t work at all!!  </li>
            <li>Does a great job with color, but it changes the texture and finish of my foundation into a very matte finish and also makes it cling to my dry patches.</li>
            <li>It may work great for someone with smooth skin with hard to find foundation shade or just needs a bit of brightening with matte finish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breakouts (which is rare for me with any face product).</li>
            <li>I mixed this foundation with L&#x27;oreal Magic Nude Liquid Powder in Light Ivory (310)</li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s own this foundation does next to nothing.</li>
            <li>I also tried it alone over my moisturizer without mixing and was surprised to find out that it was not an overwhelming \\&quot;white\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>however much you think is good for your skin tone) and mix it together and your foundation will instantly become lighter!</li>
            <li>This is a great solution for pale people.</li>
            <li>Good for lightening up foundations that are too dark.</li>
            <li>As long as you know how to blend you&#x27;re liquid foundation well with a brush (making sure to clean your skin and apply face primer beforehand), it won&#x27;t look &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put a better review yet, due go haven&#x27;t tried it but super excited to I</li>
            <li>One pump of this mixed in with the lightest foundation I can find and it makes a perfect match without making me look dead.</li>
            <li>Shipping is super fast, said it was going to arrive march 10th -</li>
            <li>finish in one coat is very natural and light.</li>
            <li>This product requires some skill at applying (dabbing, not streaking) but it works great on my SUPER pale skin and when applied properly goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>I like this very much.  </li>
            <li>and I like the result very much.  </li>
            <li>Wow, super oily!  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient is water so it very much feels like a water</li>
            <li>it was thicker and made my skin look flawless this amazon product is fake as hell.</li>
            <li>I had also bought the white powder compact and my hope was to pat that on top of the foundation if I started to get shiny.  </li>
            <li>However, when I do want a more matte finish, I set my entire face with a pressed powder and the shine disappears</li>
            <li>It feels pretty smooth and creamy when applied, but not heavy or cakey afterward.</li>
            <li>I mostly used it for mixing it with my foundation (1/3 white , 2/3 foundation) to make it lighter.  </li>
            <li>Tubes of white &amp;#34;gease-paint&amp;#34; would be a much better make-up for costuming events.</li>
            <li>Just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li>When it comes to costume makeup this is sooo much better than using white grease or clown  makeup.</li>
            <li>The only makeup that matches my skin tone :)</li>
            <li>could see myself falling in love with this foundation, entirely based on the swatch test.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fair skinned girls often times have trouble finding a foundation to match their skintone, but this product can mix into any foundation and solve the problem.</li>
            <li>Went on just like a good liquid foundation and layered well to increase the pale look.  </li>
            <li>My dry skin benefits more from a dewy finish anyway, so straight-up matte is rarely my go-to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wearing it by itself can be done if you&#x27;re super pale, while it&#x27;s pure white, it blends nicely like a very light foundation</li>
            <li>This stuff is perfect for blending in with that other foundation that&#x27;s a bit too dark.</li>
            <li>I have heard a very fair skinned youtuber absolutely RAVE about this product because every foundation brand in the lightest shade would be too dark for her, and I would have the same problem.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re already pretty fair it will probably work like a charm, for me personally the product was only so-so.</li>
            <li>You can notice that the product has high quality, so I guess that it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>(the most porcelain of porcelain does not touch how light my skin is) and now I can actually use the various foundations I&#x27;ve purchased by mixing this in at a 50/50 ratio.</li>
            <li>I can mix it with pretty much any foundation</li>
            <li>Adding this to my foundations (whether high quality or drugstore brands) lightens them while keeping the coverage the same, maybe even better.</li>
            <li>BUT, I still use the white powder compact to this day on top of my normal every day makeup.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and practical, I like that it pumps out, and it&#x27;s mixed well with every foundation I&#x27;ve tried it with so far (both drugstore and high end).</li>
            <li>The best way to mix it is on the back of your hand, slowly adding the white to your original until the desired color has been reached.</li>
            <li>As somebody with skin so pale that most of even the lightest foundations lend me a yellow tone that makes my red patches show up more, I am in LOVE with this foundation.</li>
            <li>I bought this to mix in with foundation since I am very pale and drugstore foundations never have a good color range, and I dont want to spend $30</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It comes with a pump, huge plus&lt;br /&gt;-I would recommend using with other foundations for the best finish and blending (not really a product meant to be used alone for for an EXTREME stage makeup affect (</li>
            <li>Plus, I dab a bit of extra in the creases of my eye bags with a fine brow brush and it really helps to camouflage everything.</li>
            <li>My recent foundation works very nicely besides having a slight tint.</li>
            <li>I would really like to have lighter foundation, so</li>
            <li>This really is the must have item for</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need that much with my ivory foundations.  </li>
            <li>this was very see through...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I did without it.</li>
            <li>I could never find foundation light enough for my skin - until now!</li>
            <li>Another issue I have with lighter foundations is that they are pink toned more ofter than not</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I mixed this with a light ivory foundation I got at the drugstore</li>
            <li>I can now wear all my high end makeup and not look orange!</li>
            <li>The foundation is very thin/water, and doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage.</li>
            <li>Ive always struggled finding foundation that is light enough for me.</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>It was very drying on the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair-skinned, but half-Cuban, so</li>
            <li>It really evens out my skin tone</li>
            <li>I use this as a mixer with another foundation because I couldn&#x27;t find a shade that was light enough for me.</li>
            <li>Whoever handled this glass bottle did not think very well.</li>
            <li>This lightens up the foundation very well.</li>
            <li>I tried using it as a hilight, but the consistency is really meant for mixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I can never find a foundation light enough.</li>
            <li>And for the price, there is SO much product and</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>It goes on and comes off very well.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t really mix with the foundations I&#x27;ve tried (revlon colorstay, revlon photoready,</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too light for me to use one its own, but when mixed with my regular foundations (at about a 1:3 ratio, with this being the lesser)</li>
            <li>very subtle)&lt;br /&gt;-Wonderful</li>
            <li>but that didn&#x27;t really seem to be a problem.</li>
            <li>Cons: Use too much or use it alone and it may look chalky or get oily and set in your pores.</li>
            <li>I saw this on YouTube, and I am very pale, and adding this to foundations that are too dark for me is perfect!</li>
            <li>In love with this I&#x27;m super pale and I can&#x27;t live with out MP dreamtone</li>
            <li>My original purchase was MP Goth White Cream Foundation.</li>
            <li>so maybe this would be a little better for someone with a more dry complexion.</li>
            <li>(obviously this will change with how fair you are and how dark your foundation is).</li>
            <li>Now if only they made this with the undertones to balance a foundation to the perfect levels (pink, blue, yellow, purple).</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t make the foundation have less coverage and blends in very well.</li>
            <li>mix equal parts of this with Lorel True Match:</li>
            <li>This is so much cheaper than Illamasqua&#x27;s white liquid foundation, and it actually looks better when applying it on my skin.</li>
            <li>currently use this white foundation to mix with my regular foundations since I&#x27;m ridiculously fair.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is neat, although I&#x27;d much prefer a tube so as to be able to cut it open and use up the entirety once I&#x27;m running low.</li>
            <li>The consistency is thick and creamy, so if you&#x27;re going to be wearing this you&#x27;d best wash your face properly and on a regular basis - beyond</li>
            <li>Some people may not have a problem with the foundation since everyone has different skin tones, but overall this is a better product than the cream make-up you can get at Halloween stores.</li>
            <li>It is super watery and so low coverage that it doesn&#x27;t even show on my skin!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item as well as the Virgin White Pressed Powder by Manic Panic and before anything else I have to say I was extremely satisfied with the seller Fatal Impact and would personally recommend/order from them again because of how trustworthy and speedy the shipping was.</li>
            <li>However longevity was not my main cocern.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>no other foundation seems to be light enough for me) and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Needs a setting powder over the top to keep it from being a smudgy mess</li>
            <li>All in all, I would highly recommend this product to anyone else who needs help adjusting their foundation.</li>
            <li>Overall it mixes nicely with other foundations to achieve a lighter shade.</li>
            <li>I use L&#x27;oreal Visible Lift Serum Absolute 144 that usually accommodates my flaky patches with very light dewy finish.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I just mix a little more of this with my colored foundation.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about this changing the formula of my favorite foundation (covergirl outlast 3-in-1)</li>
            <li>I had hoped it would be opaque, as I was going to use it to mix with my normal foundation (can never find it light enough) but it&#x27;s very runny and quite sheer</li>
            <li>a bit greasy, wish it dried better.</li>
            <li>This new bottle design is much easier to use than the old bottle.</li>
            <li>Well...just the right amount of white.</li>
            <li>those of you constantly struggling to find foundation in the right shade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend mixing your foundation with Dreamtone on the back of your hand (with a finger) until you get the color right and then applying the mixture to your face with a brush or a beauty blender.</li>
            <li>After ready by many reviews of how this had worked for translucent girls such as myself I decided purchase and try to lighten some of my foundations that were just a bit too dark for my ghost-flesh.</li>
            <li>If you have this kind of trouble, I would definitely recommend trying these two products.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin, and this does not make me break out at all</li>
            <li>If you have a drawer full of foundations you love that are just a little too dark, or if you want to try out a new foundation that you know isn&#x27;t going to match your snow-skin, I would suggest picking this up.</li>
            <li>It can be mixed up to 50% with your regular foundation without changing the texture/coverage of your original foundation.</li>
            <li>But since a product that costs less than lunch at a sub shop does the job just fine for me, I have no plan or desire to try</li>
            <li>What little pigment it does contain gets caught on any dry areas of skin and makes them stand out even more!  </li>
            <li>Every single makeup brand I&#x27;ve tried from drug store to high end never have a shade light enough for me.</li>
            <li>Its hard to find a super light foundation, regardless of drug store or high end, and mixing this with my current foundation works wonders!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Creamy and goes on smooth and last a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I tried to apply the powder, the foundation started to look really blotchy and spotty and all I did was push greasy spots of foundation around my face making it all super uneven.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as pure white as using the Manic Panic foundation on</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that it&#x27;s pure white, I don&#x27;t look like a clown when I use it.</li>
            <li>This foundation feels a little oily on my skin but other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>Overall I really like it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any adverse effects while using this product, despite having sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>finish is somewhat matte, like a natural matte and it does take a while to oxidize&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this a long time ago when it had a dipstick and after using that for over a year and touching it with my oily fingers it started to go sour.</li>
            <li>It blends good but does not give you the fake \\&quot;white\\&quot; effect like a vampire.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s truly a good foundation, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li>It only took me a few tries to get the magic formula right.</li>
            <li>I use this to dilute my regular foundation because I am too pale for most colors sold in the drug store.</li>
            <li>I am a super pale person and most foundations are either too dark or too yellow toned for me.</li>
            <li>I really like it, but I have very sensitive skin (very dry and very sensitive)</li>
            <li>I am suppppppppppppper pale and could never find a foundation that was actually light enough for me (and not about to spend $50 on a high end one).</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s got no undertones-straight up white, because I&#x27;m really yellowy and not pink.</li>
            <li>Too white for even the lightest drugstore foundation and too broke for high end?</li>
            <li>Most high-end foundations do not carry a shade light enough for me (those that do are priced at levels akin to purchasing an expensive piece of kitchen equipment, and I do not have the means/desire to pay such prices for cosmetics).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also blended it into my too dark concealers with much success, too.</li>
            <li>Pale white goth skin is not always easy to come by.</li>
            <li>She asked me for the Manic Panic Virgin White Pressed Powder Gothic Vampire and the Manic Panic Virgin Dreamtone Gothic Foundation Vampire White, for her Birthday, to mix with her regular makeup to try and come up with the right shade it.</li>
            <li>I got this because I have super pale skin and any foundation/</li>
            <li>One day I cleaned out my bathroom and realized how many bottles of foundation I owned that were hidden away because they were too dark.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s almost impossible to find a contouring product that highlights, but half of a pump of this works great!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too expensive and comes in a huge container that is far too much for me.</li>
            <li>But a soft white.</li>
            <li>It would discourage me from purchasing some foundations because I knew they wouldn&#x27;t match me even in the apparently &amp;#34;lightest&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li>I can now lighten enough to blend almost seamlessly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noticeable up close, but not a big deal far away.</li>
            <li>I mix it with my BB cream or foundation to match my skin tone, most foundations are too dark for my pale skin.</li>
            <li>You can use less for a more translucent pale look (combined with a skin tone powder for some skin tone coming through).</li>
            <li>Also, because this stuff contains titanium dioxide in high amounts (it&#x27;s what the white pigment is), it clings to dry patches and will show up in pictures.  </li>
            <li>You need to use about 4 or 5 pumps and set it with a white powder for full face coverage if you&#x27;re going for the very pale goth look.</li>
            <li>The only other 2 white foundations are from MAC and Illamasqua, and would have drained my wallet for something that&#x27;s pretty necessary.</li>
            <li>I like a really thick, full coverage, and this doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>Really, it is a wallet saver since I can now use up foundations that I previously invested in.</li>
            <li>and I dont have to blend down my entire neck for my foundation to look normal!</li>
            <li>It was a total mess by the end of the day and it ruined my whole costume.  </li>
            <li>It is really blotchy, and despite being cakey as heck, gives little coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker than the ivory foundation that I mix it with, and I find that it really helps to give my face a fuller coverage.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, and can be a little &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; for a foundation.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the mixture does look a little strange at first.</li>
            <li>So, I was a little hesitant about purchasing straight up white makeup...</li>
            <li>no matter how pale you are no ones skin is pure paper white.</li>

            <li> This is GREAT for mixing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy my face is no longer orange</li>
            <li> Seller was great.</li>
            <li> this is amazing it perfectly blends in with your skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is Amazing!</li>
            <li> This comes in handy!</li>
            <li> The perfect shade for my lovely paper like skin.</li>
            <li> When used correctly, this product works beautifully and it can even impart a nice lunar glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t go on totally smooth and flawless.  </li>
            <li> I have the \\&quot;pregnancy mask\\&quot; going on, even though I&#x27;m naturally fair skinned.</li>
            <li> It took a surprising amount to lighten it to the correct shade (about 1/4 of a bottle), but it did its job.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as a primer, and mixes well with colored foundation to adjust the shade, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really fair</li>
            <li> This product is good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively fair, but I like to look spooky.</li>
            <li> This is great for costume makeup on its own or to lighten the color another foundation.</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t make the foundation magically fit me perfectly.</li>
            <li> Pros: blends perfectly with another liquid foundation for a smooth gothic look.</li>
            <li> Great product, I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product, perfect consistency, high quality.</li>
            <li> product is a great price and has outstanding quality and results.</li>
            <li> But, the more you experiment and work with it, it can find a great place in your collection.</li>
            <li> but I am so fair that I could wear it on its own but struggle to even it out.</li>
            <li> i mix this with my foundation because none are the right shade for me, this makes my skin not look like i smeared my face with dorito residue :D</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> I really love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> Did not blend with my foundation at all...like mixing oil and water even though my foundation is oil free!?!</li>
            <li> This is perfect to add to my foundations to lighten them instead of buying 2 shades (can become costly when you buy higher end foundations).</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> I would not wear this on its own -</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t change the foundations&#x27; finishes or consistencies too much either which is excellent.</li>
            <li> The results were astounding.</li>
            <li> Warm Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to stay well, which is nice.</li>
            <li> nice when u mix w ur foundation</li>
            <li> Also really great for special effects/costume makeup.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my normal foundation to get the perfect shade I need</li>
            <li> If your very fair it would be great for a regular foundation.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does what it say it is, amazing!!</li>
            <li> It dispenses out of the pump very easily.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned, so finding a foundation that works for me is a bit of a challenge,  even when purchasing the absolute lightest color.</li>
            <li> offers some coverage, and the service was great!</li>
            <li> Great for Halloween &amp; costume make-up, but excellent at lightening a foundation that is too dark for my porcelain skin tone.</li>
            <li> This paired with any foundation is amazing because you can get it as light as you need!</li>
            <li> This product is great to make ANY foundation that&#x27;s too dark for you match your skin perfectly!</li>
            <li> I very lightly brush it over my face and it gives me a nice matte flawless look without looking too white (my skin tone is medium).</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s very important to BLENNNNNNNNDDD</li>
            <li> This must be a new formula or something because it goes on so smoothly and covers wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I got this to go with my manic panic gothic vampire powder since I have a gothic side its perfect for the days I go all gothic its a great product also hard to find here in texas</li>
            <li> This is meant to be mixed with foundations to lighten them, and it does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Applying it was ok</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this</li>
            <li> I add a tiny bit to my BB cream and it matches my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> We used this foundation and it works so much better then</li>
            <li> I needed something to lighten my current foundation to match my skin and this does a great job!</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mix it at more than a 50:50 ratio.  </li>
            <li> ended up purchasing the Mehron white makeup and that worked perfect.</li>
            <li> I do tend to have more oily skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I will purchase again before I run out and would recommend to all the light skin beauties out there!</li>
            <li> so I also used the Manic Panic &amp;#34;Goth White&amp;#34; Powder Cream Foundation which worked 100% better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but if your just looking to light up your foundation mixing this will help amazingly c:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I have a yellowish/light olive undertone; this stuff helps lighten the undertones in my foundation to finally make a perfect match.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Wish I did this sooner :)</li>
            <li> Now it won&#x27;t spoil from contamination. :]</li>
            <li> So much better than stage clown make up.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite consistency...</li>
            <li> I also use some translucent powder to go on top so that it doesn&#x27;t darken the color.</li>
            <li> but i care more about service.</li>
            <li> but i hope you guys get better attitude on products.</li>
            <li> This is not a foundation but more like primer.</li>
            <li> A child&#x27;s water paints would have been better, although still not the way to go.  </li>
            <li> My favorite foundation (Kat Von D&#x27;s lock-it tattoo foundation in 44)</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s outrageously better than it was before, but it&#x27;s still not &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product also did not cause any breakouts (for me personally) and doubles as a great eyeshadow primer!</li>
            <li> mine came with a dauber top.</li>
            <li> :) Unscented.  </li>
            <li> Because of this I have had to start undoing the top and skipping the pump altogether.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-May review again when I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty pleased with the product and VERY pleased with the seller/service/shipping&lt;br /&gt;Buy from Fatal Impact</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, goes on silky smooth. :)</li>
            <li> and I have never been able to find a foundation that is as light as my skin tone.</li>
            <li> In the couple of weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it, it works great so far.</li>
            <li> However, it arrived in perfect condition and the foundation arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> it ends up looking less awesome and more streaky.  </li>
            <li> I add a little of this to my favorite foundation and it gives me the perfect color.</li>
            <li> It works best with other liquid foundations</li>
            <li> It is suitable for someone with very fair skin to either mix with a foundation that is too dark, or to use alone.</li>
            <li> Washes off really easy.</li>
            <li> for fair skin, correcting tone in foundations&lt;br /&gt;-Feels light, very build-able coverage&lt;br /&gt;-Really</li>
            <li> This does have a satin kind of finish which is okay, but it seems like it makes my makeup have a more natural look!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it changed the texture of my foundation formula, if anything it made it a tad bit more full coverage.</li>
            <li> Good texture and is relatively light with decent coverage.</li>
            <li> how quickly it came in the mail!</li>
            <li> It goes on really smooth and it&#x27;s lightweight.</li>
            <li> and i felt it just was too light.</li>
            <li> I use this as a shade deluiter with my Kat Von D light 44 foundation.</li>
            <li> I now use light 42 but while I was waiting for my replacement I realized how well this works in that capacity.</li>
            <li> I have fairly light skin</li>
            <li> The look is great for my vampire costume and also my Snow White costume.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and not caked.</li>
            <li> Dont settle for something like this that looks like cheap party makeup.</li>
            <li> Maybelline fit me); it&#x27;s like mixing oil and water together.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s silky smooth, and doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
            <li> So in order to even out the shade of my foundation and have it perfectly fit my skin, I purchased this.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural and feels so good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for pale princesses.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it though, quite a life saver!!</li>
            <li> Its also a great white foundation for Halloween for make up transformations and special fx purposes.</li>
            <li> It comes with a pump, which is super convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product to mix with my foundations to lighten them instead of having to buy a a new bottle of a different shade and it works great for that!</li>
            <li> So, I bought this product, excited that I may have solved the problem.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to change the texture or finish of the original finish.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am very happy with this and definitely will repurchase once i run out of my current one :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because us fair skinned people can never find a foundation shade light enough.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great product to mix with a liquid foundation that isn&#x27;t light enough for those cooler tone girlies out there.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this by itself, but it works beautifully to lighten up other foundations.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s really not too oily, which is great news for my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the white make up disaster, I would have had a really good costume.  </li>
            <li> Haha, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> It feels very lightweight, even with powder on top, and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product and how fast it shipped to me.</li>
            <li> Just keep blending until it&#x27;s smooth and then apply to your beautiful pale face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mix a small amount with my foundation to get the right color - it works great!</li>
            <li> What I did to make the coverage more even was add a bit of regular ivory foundation in with the Manic Panic to create a more opaque foundation.</li>
            <li> I have used it in several different kinds of foundation and brands and it works great!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t quite cover my (caucasian) skin tone adequately</li>
            <li> Great for people who spray tan and who&#x27;s skin is constantly changing colors, people who are much paler in the winter then in the summer, and people who want to take their foundation whiter for a goth look.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a light enough foundation on its own before grabbing this.</li>
            <li> I use this to actually mix in with my &amp;#34;MAC Studio fix fluid nw13&amp;#34; to achieve my perfect shade.</li>
            <li> Then I applied manic panic virgin white pressed powder and got the perfect gothic white look I was trying to achieve.</li>
            <li> It is suitable for sensitive, rosacea prone skin.</li>
            <li> I used this for a cosplay and it was helpful but it needed assistance in becoming really opaque on skin.</li>
            <li> Works great for mixing into foundations that are too dark.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m sure you could use this, especially with the powder, as a regular foundation (light coverage), I find it works best to use it with a regular foundation to lighten the color.</li>
            <li> My makeup is an exact match to my skin now!</li>
            <li> Absolutely would recommend!!</li>
            <li> It was way too much money for something that didn&#x27;t work at all!!  </li>
            <li> Does a great job with color, but it changes the texture and finish of my foundation into a very matte finish and also makes it cling to my dry patches.</li>
            <li> It may work great for someone with smooth skin with hard to find foundation shade or just needs a bit of brightening with matte finish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breakouts (which is rare for me with any face product).</li>
            <li> I mixed this foundation with L&#x27;oreal Magic Nude Liquid Powder in Light Ivory (310)</li>
            <li> On it&#x27;s own this foundation does next to nothing.</li>
            <li> I also tried it alone over my moisturizer without mixing and was surprised to find out that it was not an overwhelming \\&quot;white\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> however much you think is good for your skin tone) and mix it together and your foundation will instantly become lighter!</li>
            <li> This is a great solution for pale people.</li>
            <li> Good for lightening up foundations that are too dark.</li>
            <li> As long as you know how to blend you&#x27;re liquid foundation well with a brush (making sure to clean your skin and apply face primer beforehand), it won&#x27;t look &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put a better review yet, due go haven&#x27;t tried it but super excited to I</li>
            <li> One pump of this mixed in with the lightest foundation I can find and it makes a perfect match without making me look dead.</li>
            <li> Shipping is super fast, said it was going to arrive march 10th -</li>
            <li> finish in one coat is very natural and light.</li>
            <li> This product requires some skill at applying (dabbing, not streaking) but it works great on my SUPER pale skin and when applied properly goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> I like this very much.  </li>
            <li> and I like the result very much.  </li>
            <li> Wow, super oily!  </li>
            <li> The first ingredient is water so it very much feels like a water</li>
            <li> it was thicker and made my skin look flawless this amazon product is fake as hell.</li>
            <li> I had also bought the white powder compact and my hope was to pat that on top of the foundation if I started to get shiny.  </li>
            <li> However, when I do want a more matte finish, I set my entire face with a pressed powder and the shine disappears</li>
            <li> It feels pretty smooth and creamy when applied, but not heavy or cakey afterward.</li>
            <li> I mostly used it for mixing it with my foundation (1/3 white , 2/3 foundation) to make it lighter.  </li>
            <li> Tubes of white &amp;#34;gease-paint&amp;#34; would be a much better make-up for costuming events.</li>
            <li> Just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li> When it comes to costume makeup this is sooo much better than using white grease or clown  makeup.</li>
            <li> The only makeup that matches my skin tone :)</li>
            <li> could see myself falling in love with this foundation, entirely based on the swatch test.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fair skinned girls often times have trouble finding a foundation to match their skintone, but this product can mix into any foundation and solve the problem.</li>
            <li> Went on just like a good liquid foundation and layered well to increase the pale look.  </li>
            <li> My dry skin benefits more from a dewy finish anyway, so straight-up matte is rarely my go-to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wearing it by itself can be done if you&#x27;re super pale, while it&#x27;s pure white, it blends nicely like a very light foundation</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for blending in with that other foundation that&#x27;s a bit too dark.</li>
            <li> I have heard a very fair skinned youtuber absolutely RAVE about this product because every foundation brand in the lightest shade would be too dark for her, and I would have the same problem.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re already pretty fair it will probably work like a charm, for me personally the product was only so-so.</li>
            <li> You can notice that the product has high quality, so I guess that it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> (the most porcelain of porcelain does not touch how light my skin is) and now I can actually use the various foundations I&#x27;ve purchased by mixing this in at a 50/50 ratio.</li>
            <li> I can mix it with pretty much any foundation</li>
            <li> Adding this to my foundations (whether high quality or drugstore brands) lightens them while keeping the coverage the same, maybe even better.</li>
            <li> BUT, I still use the white powder compact to this day on top of my normal every day makeup.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is nice and practical, I like that it pumps out, and it&#x27;s mixed well with every foundation I&#x27;ve tried it with so far (both drugstore and high end).</li>
            <li> The best way to mix it is on the back of your hand, slowly adding the white to your original until the desired color has been reached.</li>
            <li> As somebody with skin so pale that most of even the lightest foundations lend me a yellow tone that makes my red patches show up more, I am in LOVE with this foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix in with foundation since I am very pale and drugstore foundations never have a good color range, and I dont want to spend $30</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It comes with a pump, huge plus&lt;br /&gt;-I would recommend using with other foundations for the best finish and blending (not really a product meant to be used alone for for an EXTREME stage makeup affect (</li>
            <li> Plus, I dab a bit of extra in the creases of my eye bags with a fine brow brush and it really helps to camouflage everything.</li>
            <li> My recent foundation works very nicely besides having a slight tint.</li>
            <li> I would really like to have lighter foundation, so</li>
            <li> This really is the must have item for</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need that much with my ivory foundations.  </li>
            <li> this was very see through...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I did without it.</li>
            <li> I could never find foundation light enough for my skin - until now!</li>
            <li> Another issue I have with lighter foundations is that they are pink toned more ofter than not</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I mixed this with a light ivory foundation I got at the drugstore</li>
            <li> I can now wear all my high end makeup and not look orange!</li>
            <li> The foundation is very thin/water, and doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage.</li>
            <li> Ive always struggled finding foundation that is light enough for me.</li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> It was very drying on the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair-skinned, but half-Cuban, so</li>
            <li> It really evens out my skin tone</li>
            <li> I use this as a mixer with another foundation because I couldn&#x27;t find a shade that was light enough for me.</li>
            <li> Whoever handled this glass bottle did not think very well.</li>
            <li> This lightens up the foundation very well.</li>
            <li> I tried using it as a hilight, but the consistency is really meant for mixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I can never find a foundation light enough.</li>
            <li> And for the price, there is SO much product and</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> It goes on and comes off very well.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t really mix with the foundations I&#x27;ve tried (revlon colorstay, revlon photoready,</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too light for me to use one its own, but when mixed with my regular foundations (at about a 1:3 ratio, with this being the lesser)</li>
            <li> very subtle)&lt;br /&gt;-Wonderful</li>
            <li> but that didn&#x27;t really seem to be a problem.</li>
            <li> Cons: Use too much or use it alone and it may look chalky or get oily and set in your pores.</li>
            <li> I saw this on YouTube, and I am very pale, and adding this to foundations that are too dark for me is perfect!</li>
            <li> In love with this I&#x27;m super pale and I can&#x27;t live with out MP dreamtone</li>
            <li> My original purchase was MP Goth White Cream Foundation.</li>
            <li> so maybe this would be a little better for someone with a more dry complexion.</li>
            <li> (obviously this will change with how fair you are and how dark your foundation is).</li>
            <li> Now if only they made this with the undertones to balance a foundation to the perfect levels (pink, blue, yellow, purple).</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t make the foundation have less coverage and blends in very well.</li>
            <li> mix equal parts of this with Lorel True Match:</li>
            <li> This is so much cheaper than Illamasqua&#x27;s white liquid foundation, and it actually looks better when applying it on my skin.</li>
            <li> currently use this white foundation to mix with my regular foundations since I&#x27;m ridiculously fair.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is neat, although I&#x27;d much prefer a tube so as to be able to cut it open and use up the entirety once I&#x27;m running low.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick and creamy, so if you&#x27;re going to be wearing this you&#x27;d best wash your face properly and on a regular basis - beyond</li>
            <li> Some people may not have a problem with the foundation since everyone has different skin tones, but overall this is a better product than the cream make-up you can get at Halloween stores.</li>
            <li> It is super watery and so low coverage that it doesn&#x27;t even show on my skin!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item as well as the Virgin White Pressed Powder by Manic Panic and before anything else I have to say I was extremely satisfied with the seller Fatal Impact and would personally recommend/order from them again because of how trustworthy and speedy the shipping was.</li>
            <li> However longevity was not my main cocern.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> no other foundation seems to be light enough for me) and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Needs a setting powder over the top to keep it from being a smudgy mess</li>
            <li> All in all, I would highly recommend this product to anyone else who needs help adjusting their foundation.</li>
            <li> Overall it mixes nicely with other foundations to achieve a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> I use L&#x27;oreal Visible Lift Serum Absolute 144 that usually accommodates my flaky patches with very light dewy finish.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I just mix a little more of this with my colored foundation.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about this changing the formula of my favorite foundation (covergirl outlast 3-in-1)</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would be opaque, as I was going to use it to mix with my normal foundation (can never find it light enough) but it&#x27;s very runny and quite sheer</li>
            <li> a bit greasy, wish it dried better.</li>
            <li> This new bottle design is much easier to use than the old bottle.</li>
            <li> Well...just the right amount of white.</li>
            <li> those of you constantly struggling to find foundation in the right shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend mixing your foundation with Dreamtone on the back of your hand (with a finger) until you get the color right and then applying the mixture to your face with a brush or a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> After ready by many reviews of how this had worked for translucent girls such as myself I decided purchase and try to lighten some of my foundations that were just a bit too dark for my ghost-flesh.</li>
            <li> If you have this kind of trouble, I would definitely recommend trying these two products.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin, and this does not make me break out at all</li>
            <li> If you have a drawer full of foundations you love that are just a little too dark, or if you want to try out a new foundation that you know isn&#x27;t going to match your snow-skin, I would suggest picking this up.</li>
            <li> It can be mixed up to 50% with your regular foundation without changing the texture/coverage of your original foundation.</li>
            <li> But since a product that costs less than lunch at a sub shop does the job just fine for me, I have no plan or desire to try</li>
            <li> What little pigment it does contain gets caught on any dry areas of skin and makes them stand out even more!  </li>
            <li> Every single makeup brand I&#x27;ve tried from drug store to high end never have a shade light enough for me.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a super light foundation, regardless of drug store or high end, and mixing this with my current foundation works wonders!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Creamy and goes on smooth and last a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I tried to apply the powder, the foundation started to look really blotchy and spotty and all I did was push greasy spots of foundation around my face making it all super uneven.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as pure white as using the Manic Panic foundation on</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that it&#x27;s pure white, I don&#x27;t look like a clown when I use it.</li>
            <li> This foundation feels a little oily on my skin but other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> Overall I really like it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any adverse effects while using this product, despite having sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> finish is somewhat matte, like a natural matte and it does take a while to oxidize&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this a long time ago when it had a dipstick and after using that for over a year and touching it with my oily fingers it started to go sour.</li>
            <li> It blends good but does not give you the fake \\&quot;white\\&quot; effect like a vampire.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s truly a good foundation, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> It only took me a few tries to get the magic formula right.</li>
            <li> I use this to dilute my regular foundation because I am too pale for most colors sold in the drug store.</li>
            <li> I am a super pale person and most foundations are either too dark or too yellow toned for me.</li>
            <li> I really like it, but I have very sensitive skin (very dry and very sensitive)</li>
            <li> I am suppppppppppppper pale and could never find a foundation that was actually light enough for me (and not about to spend $50 on a high end one).</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s got no undertones-straight up white, because I&#x27;m really yellowy and not pink.</li>
            <li> Too white for even the lightest drugstore foundation and too broke for high end?</li>
            <li> Most high-end foundations do not carry a shade light enough for me (those that do are priced at levels akin to purchasing an expensive piece of kitchen equipment, and I do not have the means/desire to pay such prices for cosmetics).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also blended it into my too dark concealers with much success, too.</li>
            <li> Pale white goth skin is not always easy to come by.</li>
            <li> She asked me for the Manic Panic Virgin White Pressed Powder Gothic Vampire and the Manic Panic Virgin Dreamtone Gothic Foundation Vampire White, for her Birthday, to mix with her regular makeup to try and come up with the right shade it.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have super pale skin and any foundation/</li>
            <li> One day I cleaned out my bathroom and realized how many bottles of foundation I owned that were hidden away because they were too dark.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s almost impossible to find a contouring product that highlights, but half of a pump of this works great!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive and comes in a huge container that is far too much for me.</li>
            <li> But a soft white.</li>
            <li> It would discourage me from purchasing some foundations because I knew they wouldn&#x27;t match me even in the apparently &amp;#34;lightest&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li> I can now lighten enough to blend almost seamlessly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noticeable up close, but not a big deal far away.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my BB cream or foundation to match my skin tone, most foundations are too dark for my pale skin.</li>
            <li> You can use less for a more translucent pale look (combined with a skin tone powder for some skin tone coming through).</li>
            <li> Also, because this stuff contains titanium dioxide in high amounts (it&#x27;s what the white pigment is), it clings to dry patches and will show up in pictures.  </li>
            <li> You need to use about 4 or 5 pumps and set it with a white powder for full face coverage if you&#x27;re going for the very pale goth look.</li>
            <li> The only other 2 white foundations are from MAC and Illamasqua, and would have drained my wallet for something that&#x27;s pretty necessary.</li>
            <li> I like a really thick, full coverage, and this doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> Really, it is a wallet saver since I can now use up foundations that I previously invested in.</li>
            <li> and I dont have to blend down my entire neck for my foundation to look normal!</li>
            <li> It was a total mess by the end of the day and it ruined my whole costume.  </li>
            <li> It is really blotchy, and despite being cakey as heck, gives little coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than the ivory foundation that I mix it with, and I find that it really helps to give my face a fuller coverage.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, and can be a little &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; for a foundation.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the mixture does look a little strange at first.</li>
            <li> So, I was a little hesitant about purchasing straight up white makeup...</li>
            <li> no matter how pale you are no ones skin is pure paper white.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover very evenly and if you go over the same spot I found that the base you already put on kind of wipes off.</li>
            <li> I used this product throughout this whole winter because I&#x27;m extra extra pale and it has become my holy grail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for pure white foundations in the past, but Ilimasqua, MAC, and Makeup Atilier are all outside of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is a bit more liquidy so it might thin out some foundation (only slightly)</li>
            <li> I am very pale, but unlike most women I am pale with a pink undertone.</li>
            <li> highly, highly recommend it to pale people needing something to pale-up even the palest of foundation</li>
            <li> so much so that when I press the pump, the liquid squirts out, leaving small splatter spots everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;m pretty pasty</li>
            <li> If you have a dry skin patch, it will become a white patch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m for sure investing the money in something from Mac Pro if I need to because this was such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m very pale and it&#x27;s impossible to find the right shade of make up for me.</li>
            <li> and we all know Halloween makeup is either dirt cheap and sucks or is super expensive and not worth it.</li>
            <li> but you can hardly tell since it pales you out so much.</li>
            <li> It also helps balance out the tone if the foundation is too yellow or too pink.</li>
            <li> Will be repurchasing for as long as they sell.</li>
            <li> The formula is pretty thin in consistency, so it doesn&#x27;t change the consistency of the actual foundation you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very ginger pale, so even the lightest shade by MAC is too dark for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick to any skin surface, as it gets harder to apply as you put it on...but especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> it is meant to be mixed with other foundations.  </li>
            <li> But it went on a lot smoother than some other white costume makeup I&#x27;ve tried, and I look forward to using this by itself for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mixing it with other stuff seem to work well enough.</li>
            <li> criticism is that it&#x27;s a bit runny and will latch to any dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does tend to leave my skin looking a bit dry if I don&#x27;t moisturize and use a primer beforehand, but I do that anyway</li>
            <li> so it tends to dry me out quite embarrassingly so.</li>
            <li> at least look somewhat decent is to mix it in with my sunscreen.     </li>
            <li> This is NOT good for pure application.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I can get really tan in the summer (a boat girl) and super pale in the winter (I hide when its cold out</li>
            <li> I was a makeup artist for several years, and generally foundations this light in color are too thick and too expensive, but not this one.</li>
            <li> and I can finally use all the foundations I&#x27;ve tried over the years that were too dark for me.</li>
            <li> By itself, it&#x27;s pretty thin (see pic).</li>
            <li> I was worried about all the reviews that said it would make foundation too thin but the product is not thin at all!</li>
            <li> a little bit goes such a long way.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone looking for a one-time or an everyday pale look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible for me to find a foundation light enough for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> so I mixed it with my regular base and it mixed well but came out super oily in the end.  </li>
            <li> I actually prefer to apply it with my fingers as opposed to using a sponge- which caused it to go on a little bit patchy.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is it&#x27;s rather watery and sheers out the foundation a little.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a single drugstore foundation that is pale enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even necessary to blend down onto my neck!</li>
            <li> its like the same price and its coming from the real deal such a disappointment</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water based so it takes a few extra seconds to mix with oil foundations.</li>
            <li> They make my face look pink or something.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my light skin and hate to see it turned weird by a melanin imbalance.</li>
            <li> It was delivered in my 2 day request minus the product.&lt;br /&gt;So Amazon, in its place, sent me the Dreamtone</li>
            <li> Would be a lovely Gothic white base for foundation as well.</li>
            <li> You know, this is what I have looked for all my life, something to make drug store foundations PALE enough for me!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pale, so it works well for regular wear.  </li>
            <li> In order to lighten only slightly darker foundation it took me almost half the bottle to get it only slightly lighter!  </li>
            <li> This is the only makeup I can wear, due to my extremely pale skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not more than an hour after application, it totally started caking up and disappearing in spots.  </li>
            <li> You would expect it to work like any other foundation...</li>
            <li> When I run out of my Nars Siberia, I add this to any other &amp;#34;pale&amp;#34; foundation to lighten it.</li>
            <li> I use a dab on my hand and a dab of the other foundation and then play with the ratio until it matches.</li>
            <li> The product is extremely drying and doesn&#x27;t mix well with other foundations.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it with whipped, foam, or any other non-traditional makeup formats.&lt;br</li>
            <li> other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this foundation without mixing it with any other foundations.</li>
            <li> My skin is lighter then NC15 in MAC with oily t-zone and flaky at times in other areas.  </li>
            <li> When I first got this product I was really wary about how liquidity it is.</li>
            <li> However, you&#x27;ll have to find a way to make it work because it&#x27;s not exactly</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Now I can buy any brand I choose and not have to sweat over whether the pale loveliness the counter mirror reflects will suddenly oxidize into an orangey, faux-tan mess as soon as the sunlight hits it.</li>
            <li> Not meant to be used on its own!&lt;br /&gt;Mix this with any makeup that&#x27;s too dark on your skin.</li>
            <li> I always but the lightest foundations at the store and they are still too dark.</li>
            <li> etc I have tried is still too dark, even in the lightest shade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a color corrector, meaning, if your foundation is too dark, you add a couple of drops to lighten/correct</li>
            <li> She always has a dark line just under her chin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix with a foundation that was a hair too dark for my skin (despite it being the lightest shade offered).</li>
            <li> so I could use it to lighten too dark foundation and to use it as a highlighter</li>
            <li> The lightest shade of foundation is almost always too dark for me.</li>
            <li> This product is meant to be used as a color corrector- to lighten up your darker foundations- to match your winter skin tone, or correct a product that just looks too dark.</li>
            <li> I can make any foundation that is too dark for me lighter.  </li>
            <li> I mix it about one to one with my foundations that are too dark</li>
            <li> I saw a tutorial where someone used this as something to lighten foundation that was too dark.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit watery.</li>
            <li> I bought this to lighten my too dark foundations as I have never found one to match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It is not a clown thick white makeup.</li>
            <li> Due to other reviews I was actually expecting the powder to be broken upon arrival or perhaps cracked due to</li>
            <li> it the product is watered down or something shame on you.</li>
            <li> In other words, don&#x27;t wear it to do heavy labor or stage work, but an every day foundation</li>
            <li> I use a half pump to lighten up my foundations.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly abrasive smell to it, but it&#x27;s not noticeable once you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> Now I can wear foundation without looking oddly tanned on my face.</li>
            <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-smells oddly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if their off-white tones are any less watery.</li>
            <li> I am somewhere between very pale and pale; i have such trouble finding a foundation that matches.</li>
            <li> less coverage than i expected, not good on dry skin</li>
            <li> so pale that even the lightest shade of makeup is dark on me.</li>
            <li> The foundation was gathering in every little crease on my face.  </li>
            <li> I put a little of this in my hand and mix it with my foundation.  </li>
            <li> Very sheer and uneven coverage!!!  </li>
            <li> what happened to this product it is so thin and runny i have used this product before the only thing is</li>
            <li> just got it in the mail, I will leave an update when I try it tonight then in few weeks</li>
            <li> Unfortunate this product even made it to the market, but at least it is only $10.     Despite being only $10</li>
            <li> It is also liquidy enough to spread thinly over an area to use as a  highlight/contour.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, it doesn&#x27;t cake or make my face feel grimy.</li>
            <li> so I have trouble finding a highlight shade that works.  </li>
            <li> I just add a few pumps into my foundation bottle close it, shake it, and test it.</li>
            <li> So this youtuber was saying just take a few pumps of the foundation, and about 1-2 pumps of this (or</li>
            <li> solved the watery/too pale problem by mixing it with a little bit of pale drugstore foundation and rubbing it in on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am one of those ultra pale people who bordered on accepting having a slightly orange face, but not anymore!</li>
            <li> I have really pale skin</li>
            <li> Point being, I&#x27;m already pale.</li>
            <li> If you have pale skin, this is a must-have product</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a shockingly pale complexion, this might not do the trick.</li>
            <li> I got this product to mix with my foundation I have to use a lot of product to get it as pale as needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite a pale woman.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale, and so when I use foundations from anywhere else, it always makes my skin look darker.</li>
            <li> This foundation is purrrrfect for my milky pale skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not that pale</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and the hardest time finding foundations that are not too dark.  </li>
            <li> But other than that I would definitely recommend this to people who either are looking for a white foundation or have terrible trouble finding a foundation that is pale enough for us pale princesses out there.</li>
            <li> To the people who have reviewed this product negatively as a foundation, saying it goes on splotchy with an odd texture-</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pale, desperate and don&#x27;t want to spend $$ for Nars Siberia and other such foundations, this&#x27;ll work.  </li>
            <li> It was also hard to apply because it looked smeary and uneven.</li>
            <li> My face looked like a grease slick.  </li>
            <li> I was so anxious for this product to arrive</li>
            <li> The only downside is I think there is something wrong with my pump.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding foundations because of my pale skin.</li>
            <li> on pale goddesses!</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for creating a solid white base.</li>
            <li> I went as a vampire for halloween and wanted to subtly make myself look pale and make my boyfriend(who went as my meal)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> I am very pale.</li>
            <li> As a very pale person, this foundation is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, so I like to mix this with my foundation.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product that was sent to me as it had previously been opened (some of the foundation had leaked) and the safety cap was shattered.</li>
            <li> My skin is so hard to color match</li>
            <li> I ordered this in hopes it could help give me coverage or at least be added to my foundations to make them paler.</li>
            <li> But this is at least 1/2 of the price, and does the job just as well.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m so serious) for me to find any foundation anywhere in the world that isn&#x27;t too dark&lt;br</li>
            <li> I Finally dont have an ugly line on my neck from my foundation</li>
            <li> but geeze, at least it doesnt make me look like a leper!    </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with how sheer it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of spending $50 for something that ALMOST matches my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> lid was completely broken.</li>
            <li> Makes my dry skin look worse :(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn, say, Revlon Colorstay into L&#x27;Oral Lumi or anything that dramatic.</li>
            <li> I was shocked about how small it was when I got it.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> If you have even remotely dry skin, it will look disgusting.</li>
            <li> Worst makeup product I have ever wasted my money on.</li>
            <li> However, it is intended for theatrical/halloween makeup, so I can&#x27;t be too mad about that.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the worst foundation I have ever tried in my life!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible for me to find a close match.</li>
            <li> look like he was sick.  </li>
            <li> I decided I was sick of spending money buying foundation after foundation that never gets used</li>
            <li> [although I wish I was &#x3D;(  </li>
            <li> The desire effect was for the base</li>
            <li> however so I would use it with a primer, or mix it into a base if you need coverage.  </li>
            <li> Annoying when you don&#x27;t want to stain your clothes.  </li>
            <li> but I am so disappointed!  </li>
            <li> And i was very disappointed how they just threw it into the box without any coverage.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!!  </li>

            <li> what happened to this product it is so thin and runny i have used this product before the only thing is i bought it from the actual website and it was way different it was thicker and made my skin look flawless this amazon product is fake as hell. or they changed there consistency of the product it the product is watered down or something shame on you. dont buy it go to the actual website its like the same price and its coming from the real deal such a disappointment</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great product to mix with a liquid foundation that isn&#x27;t light enough for those cooler tone girlies out there. By itself, it&#x27;s pretty thin (see pic). You need to use about 4 or 5 pumps and set it with a white powder for full face coverage if you&#x27;re going for the very pale goth look. You can use less for a more translucent pale look (combined with a skin tone powder for some skin tone coming through). For the price, it&#x27;s great product to try out!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding foundations because of my pale skin. Bought this and it works great. It&#x27;s water based so it takes a few extra seconds to mix with oil foundations. I use a half pump to lighten up my foundations.</li>
            <li> less coverage than i expected, not good on dry skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s impossible for me to find a foundation light enough for my skin tone. One pump of this mixed in with the lightest foundation I can find and it makes a perfect match without making me look dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle. Not meant to be used on its own!&lt;br /&gt;Mix this with any makeup that&#x27;s too dark on your skin. It blends well and stays.&lt;br /&gt;This is a water based makeup so it might not work too well with an oil based foundation.&lt;br /&gt;A must in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I saw this on YouTube, and I am very pale, and adding this to foundations that are too dark for me is perfect!</li>
            <li> Makes my dry skin look worse :(</li>
            <li> Works Well...just the right amount of white.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put a better review yet, due go haven&#x27;t tried it but super excited to I just got it in the mail, I will leave an update when I try it tonight then in few weeks</li>
            <li> We ended up not using this because it contains aluminum.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re intending to use this as a foundation itself, don&#x27;t. This is meant to be mixed with foundations to lighten them, and it does its job perfectly. I don&#x27;t feel like I lose any coverage when I do, and instead of making me chalky or pasty, it gives me the perfect glowing fair look. I currently use this with Revlon Colorstay in the lightest shade and I&#x27;m yellow-toned.</li>
            <li> Need a couple of layers to get a non-transparent white face look.  Washes off really easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Halloween. If you&#x27;re already pretty fair it will probably work like a charm, for me personally the product was only so-so. Alone, the foundation goes on spotty despite the product being a thicker consistency. It doesn&#x27;t cover very evenly and if you go over the same spot I found that the base you already put on kind of wipes off. What I did to make the coverage more even was add a bit of regular ivory foundation in with the Manic Panic to create a more opaque foundation. It&#x27;s not as pure white as using the Manic Panic foundation on it&#x27;s own but you can hardly tell since it pales you out so much. Some people may not have a problem with the foundation since everyone has different skin tones, but overall this is a better product than the cream make-up you can get at Halloween stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and also the cream foundation for my Halloween costume.  Applying it was ok but it didn&#x27;t go on totally smooth and flawless.  It took some time to get an even look.  Not more than an hour after application, it totally started caking up and disappearing in spots.  My face looked like a grease slick.  I had also bought the white powder compact and my hope was to pat that on top of the foundation if I started to get shiny.  Well that was a big fat mistake.  When I tried to apply the powder, the foundation started to look really blotchy and spotty and all I did was push greasy spots of foundation around my face making it all super uneven. The foundation was gathering in every little crease on my face.  It was a total mess by the end of the day and it ruined my whole costume.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the white make up disaster, I would have had a really good costume.  I would NOT buy this again.  BUT, I still use the white powder compact to this day on top of my normal every day makeup.  I very lightly brush it over my face and it gives me a nice matte flawless look without looking too white (my skin tone is medium).</li>
            <li> I was worried about all the reviews that said it would make foundation too thin but the product is not thin at all! For once in my life my foundation truly matches my skin! I have used it in several different kinds of foundation and brands and it works great! I am so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> Mix a small amount with my foundation to get the right color - it works great! Five stars.</li>
            <li> I always but the lightest foundations at the store and they are still too dark. They make my face look pink or something. THIS has saved me, I add it to my foundation and voli&amp;agrave;, it looks perfect!</li>
            <li> I got this foundation to lighten the color of my regular foundation.  I have very pale skin and the hardest time finding foundations that are not too dark.  I put a little of this in my hand and mix it with my foundation.  It lightens the color well for me plus I set my foundation with an almost white powder.  It did not change the consistency or coverage of my foundation.  It did not add any oily or drying texture.  I am so glad I got this and I am really happy with it for the purpose I am using it.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have super pale skin and any foundation/etc I have tried is still too dark, even in the lightest shade. I wanted MAC body foundation in white but it&#x27;s too expensive and comes in a huge container that is far too much for me. I came across someone with the same issue in a blog and she said she used this for the same purpose I needed mine for. The price was definitely doable so I got it. Overall I really like it. I add a tiny bit to my BB cream and it matches my skin perfectly. Only downside is that it can exentuate lines/winkles/dryness. However, it is intended for theatrical/halloween makeup, so I can&#x27;t be too mad about that.</li>
            <li> This item worked perfectly to lighten my foundation. I have really pale skin (the most porcelain of porcelain does not touch how light my skin is) and now I can actually use the various foundations I&#x27;ve purchased by mixing this in at a 50/50 ratio. I would recommend purchasing a makeup palette to go with this, just because it would make it WAY easier to combine the product and your foundation!</li>
            <li> I have the \\&quot;pregnancy mask\\&quot; going on, even though I&#x27;m naturally fair skinned. I LOVE my light skin and hate to see it turned weird by a melanin imbalance. This works SOO well to use as a foundation/toner and then go over it with a powder that has some color to it to balance it out. As a warning, it&#x27;s mildly blue based so having a yellow based powder is recommended.</li>
            <li> Please know that this isn&#x27;t meant to be applied as a foundation. It&#x27;s a color corrector, meaning, if your foundation is too dark, you add a couple of drops to lighten/correct it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, goes on silky smooth. :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My daughter was the corpse bride for halloween. We used this foundation and it works so much better then the stuff you find in the halloween stores around town.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in hopes it could help give me coverage or at least be added to my foundations to make them paler. I already wear the lightest shade in Lancome (the lightest brand I could find).     Point being, I&#x27;m already pale. When you open the product, you will notice instead of a brush or...nothing at all, it comes with a piece of plastic that I suppose you are supposed to take the makeup from.     You would expect it to work like any other foundation...but it doesn&#x27;t. It is really blotchy, and despite being cakey as heck, gives little coverage. My Lancome teint idole is supposed to be sheer as heck...but geeze, at least it doesnt make me look like a leper!    I have tried putting it on with a brush, a two-sided pad, and with my fingers.    The best way I have found to make it look at least look somewhat decent is to mix it in with my sunscreen.     I would really like to have lighter foundation, so I will update if I find a way to make this stuff work, but for now...I cannot recommend this product alone.    I will try a bb cream this time, like I had planned before. Unfortunate this product even made it to the market, but at least it is only $10.     Despite being only $10, I hope this review can save someone else from wasting that money AND looking like a leper.     Horrible product. The reviews stating the product looked great ON THEIR KIDS...No offense, but the parents probably need to wear some glasses.    Seriously, this is the worst foundation I have ever tried in my life!</li>
            <li> So happy with this product! I needed something to lighten my current foundation to match my skin and this does a great job! I&#x27;m very happy with it as well as how quickly it came in the mail!</li>
            <li> Good for lightening up foundations that are too dark.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those too-dark foundations! I am one of those ultra pale people who bordered on accepting having a slightly orange face, but not anymore! This really is the must have item for those of you constantly struggling to find foundation in the right shade. I would definitely recommend shaking before every use. Adding this to my foundations (whether high quality or drugstore brands) lightens them while keeping the coverage the same, maybe even better. I&#x27;ve also blended it into my too dark concealers with much success, too. I haven&#x27;t had any adverse effects while using this product, despite having sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll update it that changes. Definitely going to be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my skin tone. This is the only makeup I can wear, due to my extremely pale skin.</li>
            <li> I am somewhere between very pale and pale; i have such trouble finding a foundation that matches. I use this to mix with my foundation to achieve the perfect shade that I need. FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> Great product, I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got this for halloween and it worked Ok. If your very fair it would be great for a regular foundation. It blends good but does not give you the fake \\&quot;white\\&quot; effect like a vampire.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very, very happy with this foundation! I mix it with my BB cream or foundation to match my skin tone, most foundations are too dark for my pale skin. This foundation feels a little oily on my skin but other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m sure you could use this, especially with the powder, as a regular foundation (light coverage), I find it works best to use it with a regular foundation to lighten the color. I have to mix this about 50/50 with the lightest foundation I&#x27;ve found for the color to match my skin. If I want to do the \\&quot;white face\\&quot; I just mix a little more of this with my colored foundation. It goes on really smooth and it&#x27;s lightweight. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breakouts (which is rare for me with any face product).</li>
            <li> Great to mix with foundations to make them lighter without sheering then out</li>
            <li> This foundation has a moderate amount of coverage. It is suitable for someone with very fair skin to either mix with a foundation that is too dark, or to use alone. I actually prefer to apply it with my fingers as opposed to using a sponge- which caused it to go on a little bit patchy. It is suitable for sensitive, rosacea prone skin. It dispenses out of the pump very easily. I am really impressed with the texture and color, and it is a good value for the price. I was a makeup artist for several years, and generally foundations this light in color are too thick and too expensive, but not this one.</li>
            <li> You know, this is what I have looked for all my life, something to make drug store foundations PALE enough for me!  I would not wear this on its own - it is meant to be mixed with other foundations.  I wouldn&#x27;t mix it at more than a 50:50 ratio.  I don&#x27;t need that much with my ivory foundations.  This is a great solution for pale people.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product that was sent to me as it had previously been opened (some of the foundation had leaked) and the safety cap was shattered. I didn&#x27;t use the product as a result so this one star is based off my experience with this seller.</li>
            <li> this was very see through... i ended up sending it back because it did not work for my Jigsaw makeup for halloween. ended up purchasing the Mehron white makeup and that worked perfect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m very pale and I have never been able to find a foundation that is as light as my skin tone. I mixed this foundation with L&#x27;oreal Magic Nude Liquid Powder in Light Ivory (310) and I was blown away by the results. My makeup is an exact match to my skin now! It&#x27;s not even necessary to blend down onto my neck! It only took me a few tries to get the magic formula right. I&#x27;d recommend mixing your foundation with Dreamtone on the back of your hand (with a finger) until you get the color right and then applying the mixture to your face with a brush or a beauty blender. The consistency of the mixture does look a little strange at first. Just keep blending until it&#x27;s smooth and then apply to your beautiful pale face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a great price and has outstanding quality and results. You have nothing to lose so give it a try! My skin looks photoshopped. I s@#$ you not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock on pale goddesses!</li>
            <li> Absolutely would recommend!! My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I like this very much.  I&#x27;m quite pale, so it works well for regular wear.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it to lighten my Kat von d foundation and it&#x27;s perfect. Would be a lovely Gothic white base for foundation as well.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I really don&#x27;t know what I did without it. I could never find foundation light enough for my skin - until now! I mix it with my current colored foundation &amp; my face finally matches my neck. Haha, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for Halloween. Its not too white, but can be layered. Needs a setting powder over the top to keep it from being a smudgy mess</li>
            <li> This product requires some skill at applying (dabbing, not streaking) but it works great on my SUPER pale skin and when applied properly goes on smooth.  The only problem is if it&#x27;s too humid (like 80-90% humidity) it ends up looking less awesome and more streaky.  In other words, don&#x27;t wear it to do heavy labor or stage work, but an every day foundation it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I got this to go with my manic panic gothic vampire powder since I have a gothic side its perfect for the days I go all gothic its a great product also hard to find here in texas</li>
            <li> My original purchase was MP Goth White Cream Foundation. It was delivered in my 2 day request minus the product.&lt;br /&gt;So Amazon, in its place, sent me the Dreamtone and it did not do what i wanted it to do. The desire effect was for the base&lt;br /&gt;of my dia de los muertos face and i felt it just was too light. Maybe vampires have a white pasty look to their faces and what i&lt;br /&gt;wanted was a heavier, whiter look.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy..bottom line!</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m very pale and it&#x27;s impossible to find the right shade of make up for me. So, I bought this product, excited that I may have solved the problem. Wrong. The estimated delivery date came and went. No product. After weeks of patiently waiting with still not receiving what I paid for, I asked for a refund. And now Amazon is telling me I cant get my money back until I return the product that I never got. I just want my money back.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix in with foundation since I am very pale and drugstore foundations never have a good color range, and I dont want to spend $30+ on a high-end foundation. Another issue I have with lighter foundations is that they are pink toned more ofter than not and my skin has a yellow undertone. So what I do is buy a foundation that is the 2nd or 3rd lightest shade, and mix in about 1/2 and 1/2 with the manic Panic Dreamtone. I love that it doesn&#x27;t make the foundation have less coverage and blends in very well. I will keep repurchasing this, and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is GREAT for mixing. I am a super pale person and most foundations are either too dark or too yellow toned for me. I add a little of this to my favorite foundation and it gives me the perfect color.</li>
            <li> My daughter is snow white and can never find makeup that matches her at all. She always has a dark line just under her chin. She asked me for the Manic Panic Virgin White Pressed Powder Gothic Vampire and the Manic Panic Virgin Dreamtone Gothic Foundation Vampire White, for her Birthday, to mix with her regular makeup to try and come up with the right shade it. It worked so well that she now looks like a china doll. Perfect! If you have this kind of trouble, I would definitely recommend trying these two products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this by itself, but it works beautifully to lighten up other foundations. If you have a drawer full of foundations you love that are just a little too dark, or if you want to try out a new foundation that you know isn&#x27;t going to match your snow-skin, I would suggest picking this up. The packaging is nice and practical, I like that it pumps out, and it&#x27;s mixed well with every foundation I&#x27;ve tried it with so far (both drugstore and high end). It also doesn&#x27;t change the foundations&#x27; finishes or consistencies too much either which is excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix with a foundation that was a hair too dark for my skin (despite it being the lightest shade offered). It took a surprising amount to lighten it to the correct shade (about 1/4 of a bottle), but it did its job.</li>
            <li> Very good lightener, I mix it with my bb cream. It has a slightly abrasive smell to it, but it&#x27;s not noticeable once you are wearing it. I&#x27;m so happy my face is no longer orange and I can finally use all the foundations I&#x27;ve tried over the years that were too dark for me. If you have pale skin, this is a must-have product</li>
            <li> I was so anxious for this product to arrive so I could use it to lighten too dark foundation and to use it as a highlighter but I am so disappointed!  It is super watery and so low coverage that it doesn&#x27;t even show on my skin!  What little pigment it does contain gets caught on any dry areas of skin and makes them stand out even more!  In order to lighten only slightly darker foundation it took me almost half the bottle to get it only slightly lighter!  I will never purchase this products again!</li>
            <li> I went as a vampire for halloween and wanted to subtly make myself look pale and make my boyfriend(who went as my meal) look like he was sick.  Went on just like a good liquid foundation and layered well to increase the pale look.  I would suggest this product!</li>
            <li> Wow, super oily!  I used this alone and it&#x27;s a bit too chalky so I mixed it with my regular base and it mixed well but came out super oily in the end.  I do tend to have more oily skin so maybe this would be a little better for someone with a more dry complexion.</li>
            <li> I used it to dress up as a vampire and I like the result very much.  You can notice that the product has high quality, so I guess that it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> -Arrived in perfect condition- unharmed in the shipping/delivery process&lt;br /&gt;-LOVE that it&#x27;s vegan&lt;br /&gt;-Great quality (seriously) especially for the price&lt;br /&gt;-Creamy and goes on smooth and last a long time&lt;br /&gt;-I have very pale skin and it&#x27;s impossible (I&#x27;m so serious) for me to find any foundation anywhere in the world that isn&#x27;t too dark&lt;br /&gt;-I mixed this with a light ivory foundation I got at the drugstore and it&#x27;s wonderful&lt;br /&gt;-I will purchase again before I run out and would recommend to all the light skin beauties out there!</li>
            <li> This stuff is Amazing! I Finally dont have an ugly line on my neck from my foundation and I dont have to blend down my entire neck for my foundation to look normal! Im so pale that even the lightest shade of makeup is dark on me. I add a pump of this and mix it up and my face is flawless and matches me perfectly! I can now wear all my high end makeup and not look orange! It does not affect my foundation in any way with consistency, wear or coverage. Thank you manic panic for making me not look like an oompa loompa!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I&#x27;m very ginger pale, so even the lightest shade by MAC is too dark for me. This comes in handy! I just mix them both together, and poof! The perfect shade for my lovely paper like skin. I recommend for anyone who has a lighter than foundation shade skin.</li>
            <li> I use this as a shade deluiter with my Kat Von D light 44 foundation. I now use light 42 but while I was waiting for my replacement I realized how well this works in that capacity. On it&#x27;s own this foundation does next to nothing.</li>
            <li> I used this makeup as the foundation for a geisha girl costume. It didn&#x27;t quite cover my (caucasian) skin tone adequately so I also used the Manic Panic &amp;#34;Goth White&amp;#34; Powder Cream Foundation which worked 100% better. The results were astounding.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for blending in with that other foundation that&#x27;s a bit too dark. I have fair skin and it&#x27;s impossible for me to find a close match. I&#x27;m tired of spending $50 for something that ALMOST matches my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix equal parts of this with Lorel True Match: Warm Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only criticism is that it&#x27;s a bit runny and will latch to any dry skin. If you have a dry skin patch, it will become a white patch. Do not forget to moisturize before application.</li>
            <li> Perfect for pale princesses. Too white for even the lightest drugstore foundation and too broke for high end? This product is the best. Just mix in a pump or two to get your desired shade. Saved my makeup</li>
            <li> The foundation is very thin/water, and doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage. If you&#x27;re looking for a shockingly pale complexion, this might not do the trick. It&#x27;s good as a primer, and mixes well with colored foundation to adjust the shade, however.</li>
            <li> Ive always struggled finding foundation that is light enough for me. The lightest shade of foundation is almost always too dark for me. I decided to try mixing white foundation in with regular foundation to lighten it so I got this and mixing it with my foundation on the back of my hand gets the perfect color! It also helps balance out the tone if the foundation is too yellow or too pink. The only problem I have is it&#x27;s rather watery and sheers out the foundation a little.</li>
            <li> I was shocked about how small it was when I got it. I got this product to mix with my foundation I have to use a lot of product to get it as pale as needed. And there isn&#x27;t a lot of product any way</li>
            <li> Oh vey!!! To the people who have reviewed this product negatively as a foundation, saying it goes on splotchy with an odd texture- THIS IS NOT A FOUNDATION! This product is meant to be used as a color corrector- to lighten up your darker foundations- to match your winter skin tone, or correct a product that just looks too dark. It can be mixed up to 50% with your regular foundation without changing the texture/coverage of your original foundation. The best way to mix it is on the back of your hand, slowly adding the white to your original until the desired color has been reached. When used correctly, this product works beautifully and it can even impart a nice lunar glow to your skin. Great for people who spray tan and who&#x27;s skin is constantly changing colors, people who are much paler in the winter then in the summer, and people who want to take their foundation whiter for a goth look.</li>
            <li> I use this to dilute my regular foundation because I am too pale for most colors sold in the drug store. This works really well and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It actually seems to soothe dryness also. It is also liquidy enough to spread thinly over an area to use as a  highlight/contour.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does what it say it is, amazing!!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, it doesn&#x27;t cake or make my face feel grimy. Love it!</li>
            <li> When I run out of my Nars Siberia, I add this to any other &amp;#34;pale&amp;#34; foundation to lighten it. I use a dab on my hand and a dab of the other foundation and then play with the ratio until it matches.</li>
            <li> I love this! I will defiantly be using this for life!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I can make any foundation that is too dark for me lighter.  Saves me money when I find clearance foundation that&#x27;s not quitemy shade..  I&#x27;m on my third bottle.</li>
            <li> Does its job, but doesn&#x27;t mix well with some foundations (Smashbox Studio Skin, hit or miss with others) . Still looking for a light enough foundation on its own before grabbing this.</li>
            <li> This is perfect. I mix it with my normal foundation to get the perfect shade I need</li>
            <li> Seller was great. The product is extremely drying and doesn&#x27;t mix well with other foundations. I bought this to lighten up my foundation in the winter month. It was very drying on the face. Again, amazon seller is not to fault for items texture.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! this is amazing it perfectly blends in with your skin but if your just looking to light up your foundation mixing this will help amazingly c:</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver !</li>
            <li> Perfect as a highlight for fair skin. I&#x27;m really fair so it&#x27;s almost impossible to find a contouring product that highlights, but half of a pump of this works great!</li>
            <li> Great item great delivery, we are happy with this seller, will deal again</li>
            <li> I am very pale. Most high-end foundations do not carry a shade light enough for me (those that do are priced at levels akin to purchasing an expensive piece of kitchen equipment, and I do not have the means/desire to pay such prices for cosmetics). I have yet to find a single drugstore foundation that is pale enough. I&#x27;ve searched for pure white foundations in the past, but Ilimasqua, MAC, and Makeup Atilier are all outside of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with expedited shipping, Manic Panic was a bargain. It has solved my color-matching problems. Now I can buy any brand I choose and not have to sweat over whether the pale loveliness the counter mirror reflects will suddenly oxidize into an orangey, faux-tan mess as soon as the sunlight hits it. This mixes well with liquid foundations, does not irritate my sensitive skin, and does not mess with the consistency of the foundations because I only need a little bit. I have not tried it with whipped, foam, or any other non-traditional makeup formats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a luminous finish. Dewy and brightening could also describe it well. Therefore, it does affect matte finish foundations. It doesn&#x27;t turn, say, Revlon Colorstay into L&#x27;Oral Lumi or anything that dramatic. However, it takes away matte&#x27;s ability to be truly matte. My dry skin benefits more from a dewy finish anyway, so straight-up matte is rarely my go-to. However, when I do want a more matte finish, I set my entire face with a pressed powder and the shine disappears almost entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hey, I&#x27;d rather have a textural issue with my final look rather than have that dreaded pinky/nude ring between my face and my neck from ill-matching foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on how it compares to the astronomically-priced luxury brands. But since a product that costs less than lunch at a sub shop does the job just fine for me, I have no plan or desire to try other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend it to pale people needing something to pale-up even the palest of foundation shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use this strictly as a mixer. I don&#x27;t dress up as a vampire or clown, so I don&#x27;t need to completely blank out my entire face. So, I cannot comment on its ability (or lack of) to work well in that area. Therefore, it does not affect my full-stars rating since I do not use it for that purpose.ng to pale-up even the palest of foundation shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use this strictly as a mixer.

            <li> One day I cleaned out my bathroom and realized how many bottles of foundation I owned that were hidden away because they were too dark. I decided I was sick of spending money buying foundation after foundation that never gets used so I invested in this white foundation. It&#x27;s perfect! I mix it about one to one with my foundations that are too dark (obviously this will change with how fair you are and how dark your foundation is). It doesn&#x27;t seem to change the texture or finish of the original finish. It works best with other liquid foundations but I have mixed it with a cream foundation and it worked too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for creating a solid white base. That is not what it does. It is perfect for mixing with foundations to create a custom color that matches your skin tone. Really, it is a wallet saver since I can now use up foundations that I previously invested in.</li>
            <li> As a very pale person, this foundation is a lifesaver. I can mix it with pretty much any foundation and it becomes a color that actually matches my skin tone. The only other 2 white foundations are from MAC and Illamasqua, and would have drained my wallet for something that&#x27;s pretty necessary. But this is at least 1/2 of the price, and does the job just as well. Also really great for special effects/costume makeup.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I saw a tutorial where someone used this as something to lighten foundation that was too dark.  My skin is so hard to color match so I decided to try the Dreamtone.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It works like a charm.  I&#x27;m very fair-skinned, but half-Cuban, so I have a yellowish/light olive undertone; this stuff helps lighten the undertones in my foundation to finally make a perfect match.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite a pale woman. I use this to actually mix in with my &amp;#34;MAC Studio fix fluid nw13&amp;#34; to achieve my perfect shade. Its about a 50, 50 mix. This product is a bit more liquidy so it might thin out some foundation (only slightly) yet it sits beautifully. I would not recommend using it alone because this is a &#x27;clown white&#x27; and no matter how pale you are no ones skin is pure paper white. Overall it mixes nicely with other foundations to achieve a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> I have fairly light skin so I have trouble finding a highlight shade that works.  I mix this with my foundation to lighten it up and BOOM! The perfect highlight.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I am very pale, so I like to mix this with my foundation. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Yayy!! Just received this product an hour ago, and it is wonderful!! Good texture and is relatively light with decent coverage. Its hard to find a super light foundation, regardless of drug store or high end, and mixing this with my current foundation works wonders! So glad I purchased this! Wish I did this sooner :)</li>
            <li> I used this a long time ago when it had a dipstick and after using that for over a year and touching it with my oily fingers it started to go sour. It was also hard to apply because it looked smeary and uneven. This must be a new formula or something because it goes on so smoothly and covers wonderfully! And the package redesign with the pump is excellent. Now it won&#x27;t spoil from contamination. :]</li>
            <li> So much better than stage clown make up.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would be opaque, as I was going to use it to mix with my normal foundation (can never find it light enough) but it&#x27;s very runny and quite sheer</li>
            <li> I bought this because us fair skinned people can never find a foundation shade light enough. Every single makeup brand I&#x27;ve tried from drug store to high end never have a shade light enough for me. I just add a few pumps into my foundation bottle close it, shake it, and test it. Now I can wear foundation without looking oddly tanned on my face. Great product, perfect consistency, high quality.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite consistency...but it sheers out well, offers some coverage, and the service was great! Feels a bit oily, but doesn&#x27;t break me out(which is a miracle)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale, and so when I use foundations from anywhere else, it always makes my skin look darker. I use this foundation without mixing it with any other foundations. It feels very lightweight, even with powder on top, and not greasy. It really evens out my skin tone (my face is redder in some areas than others, especially in the summer). Despite the fact that it&#x27;s pure white, I don&#x27;t look like a clown when I use it. I also use some translucent powder to go on top so that it doesn&#x27;t darken the color. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this as a mixer with another foundation because I couldn&#x27;t find a shade that was light enough for me. In the couple of weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it, it works great so far. It&#x27;s a little thicker than the ivory foundation that I mix it with, and I find that it really helps to give my face a fuller coverage. It feels pretty smooth and creamy when applied, but not heavy or cakey afterward. It comes with a pump, which is super convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By itself (sans mixing) it definitely paled me out. But it went on a lot smoother than some other white costume makeup I&#x27;ve tried, and I look forward to using this by itself for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> In love with this I&#x27;m super pale and I can&#x27;t live with out MP dreamtone I add it to all my foundations to make it match my skin.and it dosnt brake me out!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to mix with my foundations to lighten them instead of having to buy a a new bottle of a different shade and it works great for that! it does not change the texture or finish of any foundations i mixed it with so i would definelty recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When i got this item today lid was completely broken. And i was very disappointed how they just threw it into the box without any coverage. Whoever handled this glass bottle did not think very well. You sellers should pack extra carefull. This is not a stone. This product is good but i care more about service. I wont buy it again but i hope you guys get better attitude on products.</li>
            <li> i mix this with my foundation because none are the right shade for me, this makes my skin not look like i smeared my face with dorito residue :D</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get how people are raving about this. It works...sort of. Nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> This is not a foundation but more like primer. It is used to get the red tones out of your skin. It prepares your skin for a white gothic look. Then I applied manic panic virgin white pressed powder and got the perfect gothic white look I was trying to achieve. Perfect when paired together. The look is great for my vampire costume and also my Snow White costume. You control how white you want to go. It is not a clown thick white makeup. But a soft white.</li>
            <li> After ready by many reviews of how this had worked for translucent girls such as myself I decided purchase and try to lighten some of my foundations that were just a bit too dark for my ghost-flesh. It did the trick tinting somewhat well but broke me out like a mofo.</li>
            <li> Too runny.  When blended with foundation made it runny too.</li>
            <li> Did not blend with my foundation at all...like mixing oil and water even though my foundation is oil free!?!</li>
            <li> This product is NOT meant as a standalone foundation. I mix it in with my e.l.f liquid foundation at about a 50/50 ratio. I&#x27;m relatively fair, but I like to look spooky. This lightens up the foundation very well. It does tend to leave my skin looking a bit dry if I don&#x27;t moisturize and use a primer beforehand, but I do that anyway so whatever. I like that it&#x27;s got no undertones-straight up white, because I&#x27;m really yellowy and not pink. Plus, I dab a bit of extra in the creases of my eye bags with a fine brow brush and it really helps to camouflage everything. I tried using it as a hilight, but the consistency is really meant for mixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done, Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> My skin is lighter then NC15 in MAC with oily t-zone and flaky at times in other areas.  I mostly used it for mixing it with my foundation (1/3 white , 2/3 foundation) to make it lighter.  Does a great job with color, but it changes the texture and finish of my foundation into a very matte finish and also makes it cling to my dry patches. I use L&#x27;oreal Visible Lift Serum Absolute 144 that usually accommodates my flaky patches with very light dewy finish.  I tried it over my moisturizer and/or silicone based primer and after exfoliating with same result. I also tried it alone over my moisturizer without mixing and was surprised to find out that it was not an overwhelming \\&quot;white\\&quot;.  It just brightened my complexion by a shade or so.  It may work great for someone with smooth skin with hard to find foundation shade or just needs a bit of brightening with matte finish.  It does not provide coverage. I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I used this for a cosplay and it was helpful but it needed assistance in becoming really opaque on skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone looking for a one-time or an everyday pale look. Mixes well with skin-toned foundation to give a &amp;#34;Naturally pale&amp;#34; Look. I would recommend using a makeup setting powder with it. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much! I have very fair skin and I can never find a foundation light enough. I mix this with another foundation and it works perfectly! This is my second bottle!</li>
            <li> I have heard a very fair skinned youtuber absolutely RAVE about this product because every foundation brand in the lightest shade would be too dark for her, and I would have the same problem. It would discourage me from purchasing some foundations because I knew they wouldn&#x27;t match me even in the apparently &amp;#34;lightest&amp;#34; shade. So this youtuber was saying just take a few pumps of the foundation, and about 1-2 pumps of this (or however much you think is good for your skin tone) and mix it together and your foundation will instantly become lighter! My life has been CHANGED! I used this product throughout this whole winter because I&#x27;m extra extra pale and it has become my holy grail. It made me think, where has this been all of my life?! I don&#x27;t believe it changed the texture of my foundation formula, if anything it made it a tad bit more full coverage. Its also a great white foundation for Halloween for make up transformations and special fx purposes. And for the price, there is SO much product and a little bit goes such a long way. I&#x27;m am very happy with this and definitely will repurchase once i run out of my current one :)</li>
            <li> Very sheer and uneven coverage!!!  Very disappointing!!  It was way too much money for something that didn&#x27;t work at all!!  A child&#x27;s water paints would have been better, although still not the way to go.  Tubes of white &amp;#34;gease-paint&amp;#34; would be a much better make-up for costuming events.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and not caked.</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I was really wary about how liquidity it is. I mix it in with my Revlon color stay and my Liolee bb Cream and it works perfect! I am suppppppppppppper pale and could never find a foundation that was actually light enough for me (and not about to spend $50 on a high end one). This does have a satin kind of finish which is okay, but it seems like it makes my makeup have a more natural look! Will be repurchasing for as long as they sell. it.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I mix it with my regular foundation(considering no other foundation seems to be light enough for me) and it works really well. No irritation at all. It seems to stay well, which is nice. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit watery. I like a really thick, full coverage, and this doesn&#x27;t have it. Mixing it with other stuff seem to work well enough. Just something to be aware of. Overall, I love it though, quite a life saver!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the purpose of lightening my foundations. And it works! It dries fast, and can be a little &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; for a foundation. But, the more you experiment and work with it, it can find a great place in your collection. 4 stars ^_^</li>
            <li> This is so much cheaper than Illamasqua&#x27;s white liquid foundation, and it actually looks better when applying it on my skin. As long as you know how to blend you&#x27;re liquid foundation well with a brush (making sure to clean your skin and apply face primer beforehand), it won&#x27;t look &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this to lighten my too dark foundations as I have never found one to match my skin tone. I was disappointed with how sheer it is. It makes mixing and blending a dream but I am so fair that I could wear it on its own but struggle to even it out.</li>
            <li> worked as needed for cosplay. a bit greasy, wish it dried better.</li>
            <li> I really like this, it is very sheer however so I would use it with a primer, or mix it into a base if you need coverage.  It goes on and comes off very well.</li>
            <li> Worst makeup product I have ever wasted my money on. If you have even remotely dry skin, it will look disgusting. It doesn&#x27;t stick to any skin surface, as it gets harder to apply as you put it on...but especially if you have dry skin. Please please please do not buy this product people. I&#x27;m for sure investing the money in something from Mac Pro if I need to because this was such a disappointment. Pale white goth skin is not always easy to come by. Dont settle for something like this that looks like cheap party makeup.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pale, desperate and don&#x27;t want to spend $$ for Nars Siberia and other such foundations, this&#x27;ll work.  However, you&#x27;ll have to find a way to make it work because it&#x27;s not exactly perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently use this white foundation to mix with my regular foundations since I&#x27;m ridiculously fair.  I have to say that the formula is runny, so much so that when I press the pump, the liquid squirts out, leaving small splatter spots everywhere.  Annoying when you don&#x27;t want to stain your clothes.  It also doesn&#x27;t really mix with the foundations I&#x27;ve tried (revlon colorstay, revlon photoready, Maybelline fit me); it&#x27;s like mixing oil and water together.  Also, because this stuff contains titanium dioxide in high amounts (it&#x27;s what the white pigment is), it clings to dry patches and will show up in pictures.  On the plus side, it&#x27;ll protect your skin from the sun from the aforementioned titanium dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this to lighten foundations I want to use up, but after that, I&#x27;m going back to Nars Siberia.</li>
            <li> This is great for costume makeup on its own or to lighten the color another foundation. I use it with powder to set it and it lasts for hours. When it comes to costume makeup this is sooo much better than using white grease or clown  makeup.</li>
            <li> This foundation is purrrrfect for my milky pale skin.It looks so natural and feels so good on my skin.This makeup seems to last all day without needing touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I can get really tan in the summer (a boat girl) and super pale in the winter (I hide when its cold out haha) This is perfect to add to my foundations to lighten them instead of buying 2 shades (can become costly when you buy higher end foundations). This is NOT good for pure application. Meaning... this isn&#x27;t going to work if you are planning on putting this all over your face for white face-paint. It is ment to lighten your foundation. and for that it does a wonderful job!</li>
            <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-smells oddly chalky.&lt;br /&gt;-unusually watery for a foundation. requires multiple layers imo.&lt;br /&gt;-almost...too...pale&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I solved the watery/too pale problem by mixing it with a little bit of pale drugstore foundation and rubbing it in on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s truly a good foundation, don&#x27;t get me wrong. You probably won&#x27;t find anything like this anywhere else- and we all know Halloween makeup is either dirt cheap and sucks or is super expensive and not worth it. But Tish and Snooky could stand for some improvements. I don&#x27;t know if their off-white tones are any less watery.</li>
            <li> nice when u mix w ur foundation</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! The only makeup that matches my skin tone :)</li>
            <li> Great for Halloween &amp; costume make-up, but excellent at lightening a foundation that is too dark for my porcelain skin tone.</li>
            <li> As somebody with skin so pale that most of even the lightest foundations lend me a yellow tone that makes my red patches show up more, I am in LOVE with this foundation. The packaging is neat, although I&#x27;d much prefer a tube so as to be able to cut it open and use up the entirety once I&#x27;m running low. The consistency is thick and creamy, so if you&#x27;re going to be wearing this you&#x27;d best wash your face properly and on a regular basis - beyond that it&#x27;s really not too oily, which is great news for my acne-prone skin. It&#x27;s too light for me to use one its own, but when mixed with my regular foundations (at about a 1:3 ratio, with this being the lesser) it makes the perfect color for my winter skin... Meaning that once I&#x27;ve got my summer &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; (if you can call it that) all I have to do is stop adding this foundation and just keep on using my regular one. It&#x27;s extended the life of my foundations and even helps to reduce the redness in my complexion. I will DEFINITELY be keeping this in stock in my home!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as well as the Virgin White Pressed Powder by Manic Panic and before anything else I have to say I was extremely satisfied with the seller Fatal Impact and would personally recommend/order from them again because of how trustworthy and speedy the shipping was. Due to other reviews I was actually expecting the powder to be broken upon arrival or perhaps cracked due to it&#x27;s softness. However, it arrived in perfect condition and the foundation arrived sooner than expected. Everything was well packed, intact, and speedily delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-As for the makeup, I have yet to wear it on my face (I just got home and had already removed all my makeup). So I have yet to test the longevity of it. However longevity was not my main cocern.&lt;br /&gt;-The finish in one coat is very natural and light. The first ingredient is water so it very much feels like a water base.&lt;br /&gt;The pigmentation can be a bit splotchy but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s very important to BLENNNNNNNNDDD&lt;br /&gt;-The finish is somewhat matte, like a natural matte and it does take a while to oxidize&lt;br /&gt;-It comes with a pump, huge plus&lt;br /&gt;-I would recommend using with other foundations for the best finish and blending (not really a product meant to be used alone for for an EXTREME stage makeup affect (very subtle)&lt;br /&gt;-Wonderful for fair skin, correcting tone in foundations&lt;br /&gt;-Feels light, very build-able coverage&lt;br /&gt;-Really could see myself falling in love with this foundation, entirely based on the swatch test.&lt;br /&gt;-May review again when I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty pleased with the product and VERY pleased with the seller/service/shipping&lt;br /&gt;Buy from Fatal Impact</li>
            <li> I am very pale, but unlike most women I am pale with a pink undertone. This means any makeup that doesn&#x27;t make me look like an oompa loompa, a jaundice patient, or chalk face is guaranteed to be several shades way too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makeup is a lifesaver. My favorite foundation (Kat Von D&#x27;s lock-it tattoo foundation in 44) I can now lighten enough to blend almost seamlessly. Now if only they made this with the undertones to balance a foundation to the perfect levels (pink, blue, yellow, purple). I could wear makeup without looking like I&#x27;m wearing any at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, and this does not make me break out at all; I&#x27;ve used it for over a week, and the only breakouts I get are from when I forget to take my makeup off before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wearing it by itself can be done if you&#x27;re super pale, while it&#x27;s pure white, it blends nicely like a very light foundation, it&#x27;s silky smooth, and doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
            <li> Nothing against the seller, just the product itself made me breakout</li>
            <li> I really like it, but I have very sensitive skin (very dry and very sensitive) so it tends to dry me out quite embarrassingly so.</li>
            <li> Works great for mixing into foundations that are too dark.</li>
            <li> This paired with any foundation is amazing because you can get it as light as you need! Used with Physicians Formula translucent powder is best!</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned, so finding a foundation that works for me is a bit of a challenge,  even when purchasing the absolute lightest color. My recent foundation works very nicely besides having a slight tint. It&#x27;s noticeable up close, but not a big deal far away. So in order to even out the shade of my foundation and have it perfectly fit my skin, I purchased this. It is WONDERFUL. A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> So, I was a little hesitant about purchasing straight up white makeup... I mean, I&#x27;m pretty pasty but I&#x27;m not that pale lol [although I wish I was &#x3D;(  ] But I had seen this on a YouTubers site and I figured, might as freakin well! I was a little concerned about this changing the formula of my favorite foundation (covergirl outlast 3-in-1) but that didn&#x27;t really seem to be a problem. Now, this did help. However, it didn&#x27;t make the foundation magically fit me perfectly. Yes, it&#x27;s outrageously better than it was before, but it&#x27;s still not &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;. All in all, I would highly recommend this product to anyone else who needs help adjusting their foundation.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks!! Fair skinned girls often times have trouble finding a foundation to match their skintone, but this product can mix into any foundation and solve the problem. The formula is pretty thin in consistency, so it doesn&#x27;t change the consistency of the actual foundation you&#x27;re using. This product also did not cause any breakouts (for me personally) and doubles as a great eyeshadow primer!</li>
            <li> mine came with a dauber top. not the pump, overall worked. dont let this product become obselete</li>
            <li> Pros: blends perfectly with another liquid foundation for a smooth gothic look. Or it can be used OVER another foundation to make you look paler without looking like a clown. This new bottle design is much easier to use than the old bottle. :) Unscented.  Cons: Use too much or use it alone and it may look chalky or get oily and set in your pores. Fix this by ALWAYS setting with a powder. 4 stars definitely would order again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and how fast it shipped to me. The only downside is I think there is something wrong with my pump. Every time I try to use it, it seems to get air bubbles in it and sprays hire foundation all over me and my bathroom. Because of this I have had to start undoing the top and skipping the pump altogether. But other than that I would definitely recommend this to people who either are looking for a white foundation or have terrible trouble finding a foundation that is pale enough for us pale princesses out there.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Shipping is super fast, said it was going to arrive march 10th - march 13th and I got it on march 9th! This product is great to make ANY foundation that&#x27;s too dark for you match your skin perfectly! I will definitely be repurchasing this product!</li>
