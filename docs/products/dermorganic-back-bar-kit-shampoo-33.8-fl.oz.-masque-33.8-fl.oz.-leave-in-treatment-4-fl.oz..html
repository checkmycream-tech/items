            <li>The shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>The hair masque, also amazing, and the oil treatment...</li>
            <li>A totally fantastic deal with a great priced attached to it.  </li>
            <li>I passed on the masque at the salon because of the price, so am thrilled to get it in this kit.  </li>
            <li>The leave-in treatment is awesome; it makes blow drying my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li>safe for my color treated hair and good for the environment to boot.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spend that kind of money on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This family of 6 is going DermOrganic for good &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>but it is nice a couple times a week to counteract damage from styling.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and recommend this to people who really want a nice organic alternative!!</li>
            <li>Smells great and has significantly reduced the frizz</li>
            <li>Shampoo gets a great lather and both products rinse really clean.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo, conditioner &amp; treatment</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, lots of it, though.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>Great product gentle but effective</li>
            <li>That is a GOOD sign, not a bad sign.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge user of organic products and this backbar kit fits the bill!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this kit.  </li>
            <li>Applying the l-i-t oil to toweled-dry hair makes my hair even MORE lustrous and silky.  </li>
            <li>My hair has not looked and felt this HEALTHY in ages.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are outstanding...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I am sure that is MY issue</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is thinner in consistency than most of us are used to because it lacks all of the preservatives and fillers that are in the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shampoos.  </li>
            <li>This formula does not strip the hair of its needed nutrients and for that reason is safe for Brazilian hair treatments and semi-permanent hair colors.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the process, I must admit, is the masque, which I use every time I wash.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>I sure wish I opened my box before the time frame for returning this product expired.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is OK</li>
            <li>I have never found a better product that works with my hair so well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this argan oil and shampoo and conditioner and will continue to buy for years.</li>
            <li>I have a beauty supply warehouse nearby and have tried so many shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was okay.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic and sulfate free!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 3 month...</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair smells and looks!mazon for about $45.  </li>
            <li>Ok, lumpy product won&#x27;t come out of the pump.</li>
            <li>The scent is great, and I can really see a difference in how my hair responds to heat styling.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is substantial and a squirt of it should be able to rest in the palm of your upturned hand without running over the sides.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>the shampoo thinking maybe it was thicker at the top, but that is not the case.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are much better items at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I love shampoo that bubbles up and gets foamy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite part of the set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years and it keeps my color treated hair so healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>Found this great deal on amazon for the whole kit.</li>
            <li>Love these products.  </li>
            <li>I love how this product makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li>Oh I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>I like this scent of this product much better than many others.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Initially I was so impressed with the DermOrganic set (shampoo, masque, and oil treatment).</li>
            <li>Even my husband fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products through out the years</li>
            <li>This is a product I have used for quite a while and love it.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>love this product, been buying for over a year now.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the quick delivery and the kindness of the customer service staff.</li>
            <li>They leave my hair shiny, strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>They both smell great, and the shampoo lathers up really well for an organic and sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>Free of all the harmful ingredients &amp; full of magic!</li>
            <li>It says its $59 ($11 more than I paid), but still free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It says its $59 ($11 more than I paid), but still free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair so soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>Really does a good job and now a couple of my friends are using it as well.</li>
            <li>love these so much haven&#x27;t been able to do it!</li>
            <li>Better value than buying separately and its nice to have the really large size.</li>
            <li>You would think such a great product would have better  packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched and searched for great hair products for curly hair and now I can finally say that I&#x27;ve stopped searching!!!! :)</li>
            <li>Great return policy with Amazon meant I was able to order again and have sent to a family member that does not have local access.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so clean smelling and lathers very rich.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this shampoo and conditioner are amazing!</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t smell nice and pretty.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best kit for the money on the market!</li>
            <li>The masque was fine</li>
            <li>super bargain!</li>
            <li>I purchased products that add shine (spray on products), but my hair is oily to begin with, and adding these products tends to bring out the oil in my hair much more quickly.  </li>
            <li>I also love the argan hair oil which I put on my my damp hair right after I get out of the shower and its smells wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down</li>
            <li>This is a  huge bottle to have to use without the pump.  </li>
            <li>but I always see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have used it for 1 week now and see a huge difference in before and after photos.</li>
            <li>For maintenance, you have to use products that are free of sulfates.  </li>
            <li>And the results are silky smooth and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>Sulfate free shampoos do NOT lather a lot.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very frizzy and now that I&#x27;m using this product its nice and shiny but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo product and ended up buying this one from amazon.</li>
            <li>friend at work told me to try the Loreal sulfate free products, and I did buy them, but haven&#x27;t used them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>came to Amazon and did a search for sulfate free, and one of the products to pop up was Dermorganic.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s not this cheap in stores</li>
            <li>My daughter had given me a sample of this product and I liked it so much that I ordered the kit.  </li>
            <li>do enjoy the way the products make my hair feel and look</li>
            <li>This hair product is sulfate free and leaves my hair clean and manageable.  </li>
            <li>(it was $20 for 4 oz, made by Healthy Sexy Hair, the company that makes Big Sexy Hair), so I knew how to use it.  </li>
            <li>(it was $20 for 4 oz, made by Healthy Sexy Hair, the company that makes Big Sexy Hair), so I knew how to use it.  </li>
            <li>and I know it has washed out all of my hair products and my hair is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I thought, wow, with this being such a great price, I HAVE TO try it!      </li>
            <li>I feel like my hair is not as clean because I don&#x27;t see and feel the bubbles coming up.</li>
            <li>They are natural and organic which i LOVE!</li>
            <li>Now that I have been using Dermorganic products for six months straight, I remain 100% pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>My hair is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I was going to keep the package although I was irritated at the lack of full bottles of product</li>
            <li>I noticed a lot of breakage and split ends that I attributed to the hair color, so decided to try this product to bring my hair back to good health.  </li>
            <li>I blew my hair dry, and I must say it SMELLS AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I blew my hair dry, and I must say it SMELLS AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>love the oil too, light enough for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that anybody interested in this company&#x27;s awesome shampoo and conditioner find a place to buy it where it won&#x27;t be watered down.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure I really liked if after a few washing&#x27;s before rating.  </li>
            <li>This price of $48 is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I thought, wow, with this being such a great price, I HAVE TO try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is worth that price.  </li>
            <li>It really is worth that price.  </li>
            <li>It has grown super fast and always looks clean never greasy.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo made my scalp and hair feel really clean, but it was really watery.</li>
            <li>I have tried more expensive products and this by far is the best!</li>
            <li>For those who complain that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather like normal shampoo, it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I ordered mine from beauty spot and they sent a good product-not watered down.</li>
            <li>but with this product is dries very fast.</li>
            <li>i LOVE that it is sulfate and paraben free, due to my allergies and also because it is healthier for your hair.</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair and they help the color stay vibrant and true while bringing shine, softness, and manageability to my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, especially since I had tried so many organic, sulfate-free, no parabens and no SLS&#x27;s shampoos before.</li>
            <li>My hair is sooo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Brazilian hair treatment for the first time</li>
            <li>This was the first brand I tried and fell in love instantly with all three parts.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the 33 oz bottles six months ago and still have more than 3/4 of a bottle left.</li>
            <li>I love it and my hair comes out the same way every time I wash it.</li>
            <li>Today was my first day using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This Backbar Kit was only $3 more than the kit with the shampoo and conditioner, and I was getting a 4 oz leave in treatment.</li>
            <li>I rubbed my hands together, and applied the oil first to my ends (to avoid splitting), and then to the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li>This Backbar Kit was only $3 more than the kit with the shampoo and conditioner, and I was getting a 4 oz leave in treatment.</li>
            <li>I rubbed my hands together, and applied the oil first to my ends (to avoid splitting), and then to the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li>My first purchase via Amazon was delivered by tossing the box over my fence</li>
            <li>These products do exactly what I needed them to do.</li>
            <li>Not like a regular shampoo, but way more than Wen.  </li>
            <li>The leave on treatment gives my hair a pretty shine without build-up.</li>
            <li>My hair was silky and shiny and felt the way it does when you first walk out of a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shampoo is super gentle and the conditioner really works well for tangles.</li>
            <li>My hair usually feels soft and beautiful, but it never has that shine that some women have.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying it in smaller sizes and this time decided to go for the biggest size, which is the most reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>When it came time to order more, I found this kit on Amazon and thought that it was a great deal, since this is the same price I paid last year for a kit with half the amount of shampoo and masque.     </li>
            <li>I did find the shampoo and hair masque locally, and love these products for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by a friend, who raved about it, and I am certain that it will be a keeper for me too.     </li>
            <li>I have been using Dermorganics Argan oil for a few years now and it truley is amazing.</li>
            <li>the shampoo was great, the Masque is a bit heavy, so i only use it once a week.  </li>
            <li>The Argan oil leave in treatment never leaves hair oily or greasy no matter how much you use.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Catharine</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very silky and get compliments on my hair all the time.</li>
            <li>The shampoo really helps keep my scalp moist and you do not have to use much of it.</li>
            <li>Amazon really should look into this situation.      </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see much difference in the condition or texture of my hair after using these products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes my scalp gets really itchy, but I noticed not so much while using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really like all the products in this bundle.  </li>
            <li>but this really does everything for me.</li>
            <li>And I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the shininess when I used the spray on shine</li>
            <li>Another downside is that the shampoo really smells.</li>
            <li>conditioner works really well.</li>
            <li>Your hair is much softer after using it.</li>
            <li>I need to take three whole palms to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I received the order fast and with no hassle.  </li>
            <li>The company shipped it very promptly.  </li>
            <li>also noticed that the shampoo was very runny.</li>
            <li>I am very picky with regards to what I wash my hair with and this product gets an A+.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought I deserved it because it was such a good deal, but I paid money for this and if I wanted watered down shampoo</li>
            <li>All four of us have long hair of varying degrees of fine or course, straight or curly.  </li>
            <li>and you do not have product build up or stripping like you do so many other products,no salt,vegan friendly,no parabens,(read</li>
            <li>Taking a break with other sulfate free shampoo lines right now but will use again.  </li>
            <li>At first I was satisfied with this product and overlooked the fact that the shampoo is indeed watered down!  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m paying more than what I usually pay for shampoo and conditioner, the results are absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this same product in the past and been completely happy.  </li>
            <li>The small lather tells me that I have enough and my hair is nice and clean when I am done washing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their hair look brand new!</li>
            <li>may hair feels thicker, looks healthier, less static, etc.</li>
            <li>The product smells great and seems to be thick enough for optimal conditioning.</li>
            <li>It is essential not to put too much of this oil in your hair, as it will leave your hair feeling oily, even after a fresh wash.</li>
            <li>My first purchase with this exact backbar set was through a local Malys.</li>
            <li>I started using DermOrganic shampoo, masque, and oil treatment last year, and fell in love instantly.</li>
            <li>They gently clean, moisturize, add shine and have left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I use the small bottle of oil exactly like the directions say and I am very pleased with the moisture it&#x27;s putting back in my hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying this product</li>
            <li>I love the dermorganic shampoo and conditioner but the products I received were VERY clearly watered down.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>I do not use the oil every day as it would weigh my fine hair down too much</li>
            <li>not thick like it should be.</li>
            <li>I think this is normal consistency.</li>
            <li>I always use the masque it is not as heavy and does a better job of &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; I have told lots of friends/family about this even my boyfriend uses it for his hair(his hair turned silver early)and</li>
            <li>This is like a \\&quot;normal serving\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t want to live without Dermorganic.</li>
            <li>But the more I use it and see the clearly watered down shampoo in my hand each time I wash my hair the angrier I get!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is moisturizing without weighing my naturally curly hair down and its safe for color treated hair, which is major plus!</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I love the conditioner too; with only 3 pumpsful I am able to condition my thick long hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ordered it rather than buying from a local salon.</li>
            <li>For several years, I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair products, looking for that magic potion to help maintain healthy and soft hair in spite of my use harsh chemicals (relaxers) several times a year.</li>
            <li>but perhaps if you have sensitive skin also, you might try a sample from your local salon rather than buying a large bottle like the ones in this kit.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo that I received was clearly diluted.</li>
            <li>Since using DermOrganic, my hair is now soft, manageable, and radiant...and my fly-aways are almost nonexistent.       </li>
            <li>The buyer is responsive and professional.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin and the conditioner seems to be causing some breakouts.</li>
            <li>I am 45 years old and I color my hair at home</li>
            <li>I devoted myself to the SLS-free hair products and researched all there is to know about the natural (also called 100% vegan)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much for short hair.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo only takes about 3 pumps and spreads very well throughout the hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks, i will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li>WOW, my hair is truly soft.  </li>
            <li>WOW, my hair is truly soft.  </li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think that something with \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in it would leave your hair so soft, and not \\&quot;oily,\\</li>
            <li>I saw that my beautician used this product and my hair was always so soft.</li>
            <li>Now that I can have it at home my hair is always soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I cam tell the difference from my old conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very liquid for a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>Hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>My the year old daughter had curly hair and this help control the frizz.</li>
            <li>I color my hair and my color lasts much longer than with regular shampoos.</li>
            <li>The oil is also a bit heavy for my hair, but overall i love all three products.  </li>
            <li>unlike most sulfate-free shampoos, this one actually has a bit of lather to it and the masque can be used as either a deep treatment or a conditioner depending on how long it&#x27;s left in.</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair super soft &amp; shiny but my dry, flaky scalp is gone!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 9 months with no other shampoos or conditioners and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair!</li>
            <li>have baby fine thin straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Since I have a lot of hair I have been going through everything pretty fast, however I think it will last longer for someone with less hair and thinner hair than mine.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the products themselves, but the  pump for the conditioner was broken.  </li>
            <li>In general, I like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would definitely recommend for natural hair women</li>
            <li>So I put a weensy drop of the the Argon oil in my palms, rubbed it very well, and then worked it through my wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Finally, hair products that make my hair soft and I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry hair in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>SLS-free shampoos don&#x27;t lather up as much as the other shampoos because they lack those chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this company&#x27;s products for a while, I&#x27;m familiar with how thick the shampoo is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers up very well, and the masque is lightweight and does not weigh my hair down, nor does it leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out extraordinarily soft every single time!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The conditioner is wonderful and glides right through my hair.</li>
            <li> The best part about this line is everything they make is sulfate free and not tested on animals, which is very important to me.</li>

            <li> I love DermOrganic products!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen my hair this healthy in decades!</li>

            <li> This shampoo and masque are amazing.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are amazing.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li> The hair masque, also amazing, and the oil treatment...</li>
            <li> A totally fantastic deal with a great priced attached to it.  </li>
            <li> I passed on the masque at the salon because of the price, so am thrilled to get it in this kit.  </li>
            <li> The leave-in treatment is awesome; it makes blow drying my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> safe for my color treated hair and good for the environment to boot.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend that kind of money on my hair.  </li>
            <li> This family of 6 is going DermOrganic for good &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> but it is nice a couple times a week to counteract damage from styling.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and recommend this to people who really want a nice organic alternative!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and has significantly reduced the frizz</li>
            <li> Shampoo gets a great lather and both products rinse really clean.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo, conditioner &amp; treatment</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, lots of it, though.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> Great product gentle but effective</li>
            <li> That is a GOOD sign, not a bad sign.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge user of organic products and this backbar kit fits the bill!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this kit.  </li>
            <li> Applying the l-i-t oil to toweled-dry hair makes my hair even MORE lustrous and silky.  </li>
            <li> My hair has not looked and felt this HEALTHY in ages.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are outstanding...</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am sure that is MY issue</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is thinner in consistency than most of us are used to because it lacks all of the preservatives and fillers that are in the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shampoos.  </li>
            <li> This formula does not strip the hair of its needed nutrients and for that reason is safe for Brazilian hair treatments and semi-permanent hair colors.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of the process, I must admit, is the masque, which I use every time I wash.  </li>
            <li> I love this brand.</li>
            <li> I sure wish I opened my box before the time frame for returning this product expired.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is OK</li>
            <li> I have never found a better product that works with my hair so well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this argan oil and shampoo and conditioner and will continue to buy for years.</li>
            <li> I have a beauty supply warehouse nearby and have tried so many shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was okay.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic and sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 3 month...</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair smells and looks!mazon for about $45.  </li>
            <li> Ok, lumpy product won&#x27;t come out of the pump.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, and I can really see a difference in how my hair responds to heat styling.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is substantial and a squirt of it should be able to rest in the palm of your upturned hand without running over the sides.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> the shampoo thinking maybe it was thicker at the top, but that is not the case.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are much better items at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I love shampoo that bubbles up and gets foamy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite part of the set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years and it keeps my color treated hair so healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Found this great deal on amazon for the whole kit.</li>
            <li> Love these products.  </li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> Oh I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these products.</li>
            <li> I like this scent of this product much better than many others.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Initially I was so impressed with the DermOrganic set (shampoo, masque, and oil treatment).</li>
            <li> Even my husband fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products through out the years</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for quite a while and love it.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> love this product, been buying for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quick delivery and the kindness of the customer service staff.</li>
            <li> They leave my hair shiny, strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> They both smell great, and the shampoo lathers up really well for an organic and sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Free of all the harmful ingredients &amp; full of magic!</li>
            <li> It says its $59 ($11 more than I paid), but still free shipping.  </li>
            <li> It says its $59 ($11 more than I paid), but still free shipping.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair so soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> Really does a good job and now a couple of my friends are using it as well.</li>
            <li> love these so much haven&#x27;t been able to do it!</li>
            <li> Better value than buying separately and its nice to have the really large size.</li>
            <li> You would think such a great product would have better  packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched and searched for great hair products for curly hair and now I can finally say that I&#x27;ve stopped searching!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Great return policy with Amazon meant I was able to order again and have sent to a family member that does not have local access.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so clean smelling and lathers very rich.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this shampoo and conditioner are amazing!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t smell nice and pretty.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best kit for the money on the market!</li>
            <li> The masque was fine</li>
            <li> super bargain!</li>
            <li> I purchased products that add shine (spray on products), but my hair is oily to begin with, and adding these products tends to bring out the oil in my hair much more quickly.  </li>
            <li> I also love the argan hair oil which I put on my my damp hair right after I get out of the shower and its smells wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down</li>
            <li> This is a  huge bottle to have to use without the pump.  </li>
            <li> but I always see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 1 week now and see a huge difference in before and after photos.</li>
            <li> For maintenance, you have to use products that are free of sulfates.  </li>
            <li> And the results are silky smooth and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free shampoos do NOT lather a lot.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy and now that I&#x27;m using this product its nice and shiny but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo product and ended up buying this one from amazon.</li>
            <li> friend at work told me to try the Loreal sulfate free products, and I did buy them, but haven&#x27;t used them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> came to Amazon and did a search for sulfate free, and one of the products to pop up was Dermorganic.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s not this cheap in stores</li>
            <li> My daughter had given me a sample of this product and I liked it so much that I ordered the kit.  </li>
            <li> do enjoy the way the products make my hair feel and look</li>
            <li> This hair product is sulfate free and leaves my hair clean and manageable.  </li>
            <li> (it was $20 for 4 oz, made by Healthy Sexy Hair, the company that makes Big Sexy Hair), so I knew how to use it.  </li>
            <li> (it was $20 for 4 oz, made by Healthy Sexy Hair, the company that makes Big Sexy Hair), so I knew how to use it.  </li>
            <li> and I know it has washed out all of my hair products and my hair is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I thought, wow, with this being such a great price, I HAVE TO try it!      </li>
            <li> I feel like my hair is not as clean because I don&#x27;t see and feel the bubbles coming up.</li>
            <li> They are natural and organic which i LOVE!</li>
            <li> Now that I have been using Dermorganic products for six months straight, I remain 100% pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> My hair is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I was going to keep the package although I was irritated at the lack of full bottles of product</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of breakage and split ends that I attributed to the hair color, so decided to try this product to bring my hair back to good health.  </li>
            <li> I blew my hair dry, and I must say it SMELLS AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> I blew my hair dry, and I must say it SMELLS AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> love the oil too, light enough for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that anybody interested in this company&#x27;s awesome shampoo and conditioner find a place to buy it where it won&#x27;t be watered down.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure I really liked if after a few washing&#x27;s before rating.  </li>
            <li> This price of $48 is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I thought, wow, with this being such a great price, I HAVE TO try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is worth that price.  </li>
            <li> It really is worth that price.  </li>
            <li> It has grown super fast and always looks clean never greasy.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo made my scalp and hair feel really clean, but it was really watery.</li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive products and this by far is the best!</li>
            <li> For those who complain that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather like normal shampoo, it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine from beauty spot and they sent a good product-not watered down.</li>
            <li> but with this product is dries very fast.</li>
            <li> i LOVE that it is sulfate and paraben free, due to my allergies and also because it is healthier for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and they help the color stay vibrant and true while bringing shine, softness, and manageability to my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, especially since I had tried so many organic, sulfate-free, no parabens and no SLS&#x27;s shampoos before.</li>
            <li> My hair is sooo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Brazilian hair treatment for the first time</li>
            <li> This was the first brand I tried and fell in love instantly with all three parts.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the 33 oz bottles six months ago and still have more than 3/4 of a bottle left.</li>
            <li> I love it and my hair comes out the same way every time I wash it.</li>
            <li> Today was my first day using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Backbar Kit was only $3 more than the kit with the shampoo and conditioner, and I was getting a 4 oz leave in treatment.</li>
            <li> I rubbed my hands together, and applied the oil first to my ends (to avoid splitting), and then to the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> This Backbar Kit was only $3 more than the kit with the shampoo and conditioner, and I was getting a 4 oz leave in treatment.</li>
            <li> I rubbed my hands together, and applied the oil first to my ends (to avoid splitting), and then to the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My first purchase via Amazon was delivered by tossing the box over my fence</li>
            <li> These products do exactly what I needed them to do.</li>
            <li> Not like a regular shampoo, but way more than Wen.  </li>
            <li> The leave on treatment gives my hair a pretty shine without build-up.</li>
            <li> My hair was silky and shiny and felt the way it does when you first walk out of a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shampoo is super gentle and the conditioner really works well for tangles.</li>
            <li> My hair usually feels soft and beautiful, but it never has that shine that some women have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying it in smaller sizes and this time decided to go for the biggest size, which is the most reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> When it came time to order more, I found this kit on Amazon and thought that it was a great deal, since this is the same price I paid last year for a kit with half the amount of shampoo and masque.     </li>
            <li> I did find the shampoo and hair masque locally, and love these products for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend, who raved about it, and I am certain that it will be a keeper for me too.     </li>
            <li> I have been using Dermorganics Argan oil for a few years now and it truley is amazing.</li>
            <li> the shampoo was great, the Masque is a bit heavy, so i only use it once a week.  </li>
            <li> The Argan oil leave in treatment never leaves hair oily or greasy no matter how much you use.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Catharine</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very silky and get compliments on my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> The shampoo really helps keep my scalp moist and you do not have to use much of it.</li>
            <li> Amazon really should look into this situation.      </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see much difference in the condition or texture of my hair after using these products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes my scalp gets really itchy, but I noticed not so much while using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really like all the products in this bundle.  </li>
            <li> but this really does everything for me.</li>
            <li> And I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the shininess when I used the spray on shine</li>
            <li> Another downside is that the shampoo really smells.</li>
            <li> conditioner works really well.</li>
            <li> Your hair is much softer after using it.</li>
            <li> I need to take three whole palms to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I received the order fast and with no hassle.  </li>
            <li> The company shipped it very promptly.  </li>
            <li> also noticed that the shampoo was very runny.</li>
            <li> I am very picky with regards to what I wash my hair with and this product gets an A+.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought I deserved it because it was such a good deal, but I paid money for this and if I wanted watered down shampoo</li>
            <li> All four of us have long hair of varying degrees of fine or course, straight or curly.  </li>
            <li> and you do not have product build up or stripping like you do so many other products,no salt,vegan friendly,no parabens,(read</li>
            <li> Taking a break with other sulfate free shampoo lines right now but will use again.  </li>
            <li> At first I was satisfied with this product and overlooked the fact that the shampoo is indeed watered down!  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m paying more than what I usually pay for shampoo and conditioner, the results are absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this same product in the past and been completely happy.  </li>
            <li> The small lather tells me that I have enough and my hair is nice and clean when I am done washing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their hair look brand new!</li>
            <li> may hair feels thicker, looks healthier, less static, etc.</li>
            <li> The product smells great and seems to be thick enough for optimal conditioning.</li>
            <li> It is essential not to put too much of this oil in your hair, as it will leave your hair feeling oily, even after a fresh wash.</li>
            <li> My first purchase with this exact backbar set was through a local Malys.</li>
            <li> I started using DermOrganic shampoo, masque, and oil treatment last year, and fell in love instantly.</li>
            <li> They gently clean, moisturize, add shine and have left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I use the small bottle of oil exactly like the directions say and I am very pleased with the moisture it&#x27;s putting back in my hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying this product</li>
            <li> I love the dermorganic shampoo and conditioner but the products I received were VERY clearly watered down.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> I do not use the oil every day as it would weigh my fine hair down too much</li>
            <li> not thick like it should be.</li>
            <li> I think this is normal consistency.</li>
            <li> I always use the masque it is not as heavy and does a better job of &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; I have told lots of friends/family about this even my boyfriend uses it for his hair(his hair turned silver early)and</li>
            <li> This is like a \\&quot;normal serving\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t want to live without Dermorganic.</li>
            <li> But the more I use it and see the clearly watered down shampoo in my hand each time I wash my hair the angrier I get!  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is moisturizing without weighing my naturally curly hair down and its safe for color treated hair, which is major plus!</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair very soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner too; with only 3 pumpsful I am able to condition my thick long hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered it rather than buying from a local salon.</li>
            <li> For several years, I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair products, looking for that magic potion to help maintain healthy and soft hair in spite of my use harsh chemicals (relaxers) several times a year.</li>
            <li> but perhaps if you have sensitive skin also, you might try a sample from your local salon rather than buying a large bottle like the ones in this kit.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo that I received was clearly diluted.</li>
            <li> Since using DermOrganic, my hair is now soft, manageable, and radiant...and my fly-aways are almost nonexistent.       </li>
            <li> The buyer is responsive and professional.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and the conditioner seems to be causing some breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and I color my hair at home</li>
            <li> I devoted myself to the SLS-free hair products and researched all there is to know about the natural (also called 100% vegan)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much for short hair.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo only takes about 3 pumps and spreads very well throughout the hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks, i will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> WOW, my hair is truly soft.  </li>
            <li> WOW, my hair is truly soft.  </li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think that something with \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in it would leave your hair so soft, and not \\&quot;oily,\\</li>
            <li> I saw that my beautician used this product and my hair was always so soft.</li>
            <li> Now that I can have it at home my hair is always soft.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I cam tell the difference from my old conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very liquid for a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> My the year old daughter had curly hair and this help control the frizz.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and my color lasts much longer than with regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> The oil is also a bit heavy for my hair, but overall i love all three products.  </li>
            <li> unlike most sulfate-free shampoos, this one actually has a bit of lather to it and the masque can be used as either a deep treatment or a conditioner depending on how long it&#x27;s left in.</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair super soft &amp; shiny but my dry, flaky scalp is gone!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 9 months with no other shampoos or conditioners and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> have baby fine thin straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Since I have a lot of hair I have been going through everything pretty fast, however I think it will last longer for someone with less hair and thinner hair than mine.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the products themselves, but the  pump for the conditioner was broken.  </li>
            <li> In general, I like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would definitely recommend for natural hair women</li>
            <li> So I put a weensy drop of the the Argon oil in my palms, rubbed it very well, and then worked it through my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Finally, hair products that make my hair soft and I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry hair in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> SLS-free shampoos don&#x27;t lather up as much as the other shampoos because they lack those chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this company&#x27;s products for a while, I&#x27;m familiar with how thick the shampoo is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up very well, and the masque is lightweight and does not weigh my hair down, nor does it leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> My hair comes out extraordinarily soft every single time!  </li>
            <li> but when I discovered the shampoo to have the consistency of being watered down so I opted to return the damaged package and re-order a new one.</li>
            <li> They did refund my money but beware of buying this online and know that this product is supposed to be super thick NOT watery!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner do not weigh down my hair and leave it feeling soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, straight hair that is highlighted every 6 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> It was apparent that the bottles had previously been compromised and not only because the package was thrown over my fence.</li>
            <li> My color treated hair tends to be very dry and leaving this in my hair for several minutes seems to help a lot.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair hydrated and protected from the heat of the dryer and the flat iron,as I use themboth every single day.</li>
            <li> but it only took a few days to notice my hair was softer and generally looks alot healthier.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s too (and she has long hair).  </li>
            <li> But my makeup lasts a long time so I can justify the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I brushed my wet hair and put it up in a towel.  </li>
            <li> I brushed my wet hair and put it up in a towel.  </li>
            <li> So, I have re-ordered the shampoo and in 9 months have used 1.25 bottles - it goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I switched from drug store make-ups a few years ago to Bare Minerals and will never go back.  </li>
            <li> uhmm super thick shampoo doesn&#x27;t turn into water because of a little heat.  </li>
            <li> I thought Amazon would rectify this situation as other people have commented on the same thing.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair, you&#x27;ll need it!</li>
            <li> Its like a drink of water for dry thirsty hair, adds silkiness and shine eliminates fizz with out silicones.</li>
            <li> so I am prone to dry, coarse-looking hair  </li>
            <li> so it takes time to dry</li>
            <li> My hair had become dry and lifeless.</li>
            <li> but if I use it too regularly, it weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have to use a different shampoo just because this weighs my bleached, long thin hair down too much.</li>
            <li> Used regularly, my hair is softer and with significantly less breakage and fewer split ends.</li>
            <li> I took off the pump and noticed that the shampoo around and in the pump was solid, and the shampoo had only a small lane to flow.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very runny (not watery though, it is definitely a dark white color) and the conditioner is very thick.</li>
            <li> Since I have my hair colored blond, for some reason my hair turns into one solid clump of a tangled mess after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Love this product and feel bad that people are so fixated on the consistency of the shampoo that they are not giving it a try and are discouraging others.</li>
            <li> You will see they mostly reflect a bad SELLER, not the product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before committing myself to the expensive (and worth it)</li>
            <li> I put a pea sidzed amount of my ends and distribute it evenly throughout my hair, carefully avoiding my roots.</li>
            <li> This stuff was not capable of doing that.</li>
            <li> But, when I received the package, the exterior box was soaking wet.  </li>
            <li> This one does no because its missing the key ingredients to do that.</li>
            <li> It conditions well and leaves our hair feeling thick, soft, shiny.  </li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, the shampoo that I received is so runny.  </li>
            <li> Then I stumbled on this \\&quot;Backbar Kit\\&quot; which comes with 33.8 oz of shampoo, 33.8 oz of conditioner and 4 oz of leave in oil which contains argan oil (its not 100% argan oil like some other products here on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> Then I stumbled on this \\&quot;Backbar Kit\\&quot; which comes with 33.8 oz of shampoo, 33.8 oz of conditioner and 4 oz of leave in oil which contains argan oil (its not 100% argan oil like some other products here on Amazon).    </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve noticed with other argan hair oil products on the market.</li>
            <li> It did coincide with our termination of the use of sulfates so that may be the biggest reason for the improvement, but must give credit where due.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bottle start off so thick that I could barely pump it out of the bottle and turn runny as I got the the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I had no problem with l leaking or watered down shampoo.</li>
            <li> However, I just don&#x27;t believe that a company would water it down.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, and curly hair.</li>
            <li> color treated my hair a few weeks ago, and it was shiny for about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leery of the Argon Oil treatment.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, I really unhappy to find the shampoo has the same watered-down consistency.</li>
            <li> I ordered and received my Backbar kit a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> After awhile, they stopped working on my colored hair and leave my hair limp.</li>
            <li> I just received my shipment a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> But I just can&#x27;t justify spending $30 on a 16 oz product that will last approximately one month (not to mention the shipping).  </li>
            <li> I looked at it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I used the shampoo, rinsed it out, then put the masque in for a few minutes while I finished my shower, and rinsed that out.  </li>
            <li> I used the shampoo, rinsed it out, then put the masque in for a few minutes while I finished my shower, and rinsed that out.  </li>
            <li> Before I placed my order, I spoke with several people about my concerns with insufficient packaging because I didn&#x27;t want a repeat of receiving broken bottles.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble of having to return this and find another retailer</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding a mousse or gel or root lifter that solved all the problems.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is organic and doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemical in it.</li>
            <li> Blow dried, and was amazed.  </li>
            <li> I usually pay $30.00 for a 4 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> After trying this, I found it in T.J. Maxx at a small discount, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> Not sure about it foe the price.</li>
            <li> For the past 4 days since I began using all 3 products, my hair is shiny and has body</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, no more using 20-30 pumps depending on your hair length.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, no more waiting for 20 -30 mins as with Wen.  </li>
            <li> have a problem with dull hair.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was hardly sufficient.</li>
            <li> At least the Shampoo and the Leave-in Treatment anyway.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous conditioners and nothing get the clumps out, I end up in the shower for 15 minutes dumping everything I can find to desperately get the knots out.</li>
            <li> (Please research the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Both shampoo and conditioner are supposed to be extremely thick but the shampoo I got was the consistency of water.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and always have a ton of fly-aways.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> So sorry to say that the condition of the product was a mess.</li>
            <li> I ordered through Blue Novelties, and it seems like the bad batches are coming from this company.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use.</li>
            <li> The shampoo in the bottle was very thick (and pearlescent, as another reviewer mentioned), but when pumped through the pump it came out runny.</li>
            <li> In time, of course those chemicals will eventually wash out of your hair, but this shampoo will not cause a premature loss of those expensive treatments you try so hard to maintain.  </li>
            <li> but, I decided to leave the relaxers for the Escova progresiva or the Brazilian Keratin treatment and that meant I had to leave the Kerastase behind.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I got a bad batch or if this is the way the shampoo is made.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do use quality products in my life.  </li>
            <li> This is expensive, watery, and unused in my bathroom cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t what I excepted with reference to the reviews on the Internet.</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive in the salon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they were returned.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the pump also quit working.</li>
            <li> Besides just the issue with the packaging, the shampoo is so terribly watered down.  </li>
            <li> It is NOT supposed to be water--but thick shampoo!!!  </li>
            <li> I contacted the seller who told me some of the products have been going bad in the heat...</li>
            <li> The smell is not as bad as the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am angry and disappointed in the company that sent it to me and for Amazon for continuing to sell it!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t try the oil treatment, but I was really disappointed in how runny the shampoo was.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so unhappy with this shampoo!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t received my order yet, but I have been using the product for the last two weeks since I had a \\&quot;Brazalian Blowout\\&quot; keratin treatment on my hair.  For maintenance, you have to use products that are free of sulfates.  This shampoo, masque and oil treatment are high-quality products, that also smell amazing.  The price of this is great compared to the cost buying it in salon.  I paid $40 for an 8 oz bottle of shampoo and 4 oz of oil. This price of $48 is well worth it.  I passed on the masque at the salon because of the price, so am thrilled to get it in this kit.  My stylist used it on me during my treatment and I loved it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermorganics Argan oil for a few years now and it truley is amazing. The Argan oil leave in treatment never leaves hair oily or greasy no matter how much you use. Its like a drink of water for dry thirsty hair, adds silkiness and shine eliminates fizz with out silicones.Love it! I usually pay $30.00 for a 4 ounce bottle. $20.00 for 12 oz shampoo and between $20-25.oo for the maque. This is the best deal I&#x27;ve seen anywhere! super bargain!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this kit.  The shampoo lathers up very well, and the masque is lightweight and does not weigh my hair down, nor does it leave a residue.  I&#x27;ve used the shampoo and masque without the leave-in-treatment, however I do recommend using it in conjunction with the l-i-t.  Applying the l-i-t oil to toweled-dry hair makes my hair even MORE lustrous and silky.  Since using DermOrganic, my hair is now soft, manageable, and radiant...and my fly-aways are almost nonexistent.       I have shoulder length hair and I only need one pump of shampoo &amp; conditioner, and about a dime sized amount of the l-i-t.  Although I&#x27;m paying more than what I usually pay for shampoo and conditioner, the results are absolutely worth it.  My hair has not looked and felt this HEALTHY in ages. I am in love with my hair again!!  :o)</li>
            <li> This shampoo and masque are amazing.  I have color treated hair and they help the color stay vibrant and true while bringing shine, softness, and manageability to my shoulder length hair.  Will definitely be purchasing this again and recommending it to all of my friends.  Great find and fabulous price!</li>
            <li> This combo set is a great purchase. This is the second set I have purchased.  The buyer is responsive and professional. The shampoo and conditioner are outstanding...may hair feels thicker, looks healthier, less static, etc. The Oil is also great - nice smell, adds shine and helps control hair.</li>
            <li> I love the dermorganic shampoo and conditioner but the products I received were VERY clearly watered down.  Both shampoo and conditioner are supposed to be extremely thick but the shampoo I got was the consistency of water.  I contacted the seller who told me some of the products have been going bad in the heat...uhmm super thick shampoo doesn&#x27;t turn into water because of a little heat.  They did refund my money but beware of buying this online and know that this product is supposed to be super thick NOT watery!</li>
            <li> Hi,    I am very pleased with the quick delivery and the kindness of the customer service staff. I will do business with again and look forward to it!!   This product was recommended to me by a friend, who raved about it, and I am certain that it will be a keeper for me too.     The product smells great and seems to be thick enough for optimal conditioning. i LOVE that it is sulfate and paraben free, due to my allergies and also because it is healthier for your hair. Controls frizz and gives ultimate shine.     Keep up the great work. Thanks, Catharine</li>
            <li> Love this product. My friends use this product and they suggested to purchase it. I am very happy with it. It leaves my hair very silky and get compliments on my hair all the time. I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> The DermOrganic Argan Oil products are truly wonderful - At least the Shampoo and the Leave-in Treatment anyway.  I have somewhat sensitive skin and the conditioner seems to be causing some breakouts. I am sure that is MY issue but perhaps if you have sensitive skin also, you might try a sample from your local salon rather than buying a large bottle like the ones in this kit.  I&#x27;ve been using these products quite regularly for about 6 months.  I am 45 years old and I color my hair at home so I am prone to dry, coarse-looking hair  - - - HOWEVER my hair currently looks &amp; feels healthier than it has been in years!      If you buy these products, may I recommend that you use Four Seasons as your vendor through the Amazon site?  I have purchased from them twice now - I think they have the best prices for this line of product.  On my last &#x27;transaction feedback&#x27; the message I sent to them got lost, so I put that in my Amazon transaction review that they didn&#x27;t respond... and when the company finally found out about it they have since bent over backwards to address my issue.      Happy shopping and have a GREAT-HAIR day!  Lisa</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry hair in a dry climate. The shampoo really helps keep my scalp moist and you do not have to use much of it. Pricey though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, especially since I had tried so many organic, sulfate-free, no parabens and no SLS&#x27;s shampoos before. However, Dermorganic shampoo is very nice. The fragrance is so clean smelling and lathers very rich. I love the conditioner too; with only 3 pumpsful I am able to condition my thick long hair. The leave-in treatment is awesome; it makes blow drying my hair so much easier. And the results are silky smooth and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> unlike most sulfate-free shampoos, this one actually has a bit of lather to it and the masque can be used as either a deep treatment or a conditioner depending on how long it&#x27;s left in. The Argan oil&#x27;s also great. Keep thinking I should switch shampoos/conditioners to change things up but love these so much haven&#x27;t been able to do it!</li>
            <li> Great scent! Love the conditioner. Shampoo is watery. Very hard to use.I am disappointed with the shampoo. I am not sure if I got a bad batch or if this is the way the shampoo is made. I would not buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My hair is sooo soft and smooth. I have lots of body and a LOT OF SHINE!!! :) I am very happy with this product and will buy it again and again! I have tried more expensive products and this by far is the best! I am a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I battle with frizzy hair and feel this has been a great product.  Smells great and has significantly reduced the frizz</li>
            <li> For several years, I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair products, looking for that magic potion to help maintain healthy and soft hair in spite of my use harsh chemicals (relaxers) several times a year. I had used Kerastase products for two years before changing to Dermogranic and I believed I was happy then, but, I decided to leave the relaxers for the Escova progresiva or the Brazilian Keratin treatment and that meant I had to leave the Kerastase behind. Before committing myself to the expensive (and worth it) Brazilian hair treatment for the first time, I read all about how to maintain it.  I devoted myself to the SLS-free hair products and researched all there is to know about the natural (also called 100% vegan) hair products  on the market. This was the first brand I tried and fell in love instantly with all three parts.  The shampoo is thinner in consistency than most of us are used to because it lacks all of the preservatives and fillers that are in the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shampoos.  SLS-free shampoos don&#x27;t lather up as much as the other shampoos because they lack those chemicals.  This formula does not strip the hair of its needed nutrients and for that reason is safe for Brazilian hair treatments and semi-permanent hair colors. In time, of course those chemicals will eventually wash out of your hair, but this shampoo will not cause a premature loss of those expensive treatments you try so hard to maintain.  My favorite part of the process, I must admit, is the masque, which I use every time I wash.  My hair comes out extraordinarily soft every single time!  Now that I have been using Dermorganic products for six months straight, I remain 100% pleased with my purchase.  I purchased the 33 oz bottles six months ago and still have more than 3/4 of a bottle left. It doesn&#x27;t take much for short hair.  The Argan oil is part of my ritual as well. It keeps my hair hydrated and protected from the heat of the dryer and the flat iron,as I use themboth every single day. My hair has never been softer, shinier, or healthier. Now I don&#x27;t want to live without Dermorganic. I bought the travel sized bottles to keep in my luggage for my business trips, so I am never without this.  I have never been happier with a shampoo/conditioner!</li>
            <li> I just wanted to comment on the reviews where people noted that the shampoo was \\&quot;watery\\&quot; or \\&quot;runny\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the line for a couple of years now, and because it is an organic product, there are discrepancies in the consistency of it as it ages and sits. This is the way I&#x27;ve always known the product to be. I&#x27;ve had bottle start off so thick that I could barely pump it out of the bottle and turn runny as I got the the bottom of the bottle. I&#x27;ve had bottles that were totally runny. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s the best hair product that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I ordered and received my Backbar kit a few months ago.  The shampoo is very runny (not watery though, it is definitely a dark white color) and the conditioner is very thick. I think this is normal consistency. For those who complain that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather like normal shampoo, it is sulfate free. Sulfate free shampoos do NOT lather a lot.  That is a GOOD sign, not a bad sign.  The shampoo only takes about 3 pumps and spreads very well throughout the hair. The small lather tells me that I have enough and my hair is nice and clean when I am done washing. My daughter&#x27;s too (and she has long hair).  The conditioner just takes 2 to 3 pumps and it spreads very nicely also.  It conditions well and leaves our hair feeling thick, soft, shiny.  Love this product and feel bad that people are so fixated on the consistency of the shampoo that they are not giving it a try and are discouraging others. This is one of the nicest and affordable organic shampoo&#x27;s out there and I have tried a lot.  The Argan oil is nice, it is pleasant smelling and does not leave my hair feeling greasy at all. I am very satisfied and recommend this to people who really want a nice organic alternative!!</li>
            <li> Love these products!! safe for my color treated hair and good for the environment to boot. Shampoo gets a great lather and both products rinse really clean. love the oil too, light enough for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It works. My hair is nice and soft. I have a lots of hair so it takes time to dry but with this product is dries very fast. My hair is very frizzy and now that I&#x27;m using this product its nice and shiny but not greasy.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to Dermorganics as she uses it in her business. I love this brand.My hair so healthy,I do color it so this helps in making the color last longer and you do not have product build up or stripping like you do so many other products,no salt,vegan friendly,no parabens,(read the label),instead of using the conditioner after shampooing I always use the masque it is not as heavy and does a better job of &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; I have told lots of friends/family about this even my boyfriend uses it for his hair(his hair turned silver early)and it does not cause yellowing of the silver hair.</li>
            <li> I sure wish I opened my box before the time frame for returning this product expired.  Like some other reviewers, the shampoo that I received is so runny.  Had I not read the reviews about it supposed to be \\&quot;thick\\&quot; I would have thought it was the norm for this shampoo.  I can&#x27;t even get a lather.     I ordered through Blue Novelties, and it seems like the bad batches are coming from this company. Amazon really should look into this situation.      The conditioner is OK and so is the argan oil.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are amazing. They are natural and organic which i LOVE! They both smell great, and the shampoo lathers up really well for an organic and sulfate free shampoo. The shampoo and conditioner do not weigh down my hair and leave it feeling soft and shiny. Now for the argan oil. I have never found a better product that works with my hair so well. It is essential not to put too much of this oil in your hair, as it will leave your hair feeling oily, even after a fresh wash. I put a pea sidzed amount of my ends and distribute it evenly throughout my hair, carefully avoiding my roots. I absolutely love this argan oil and shampoo and conditioner and will continue to buy for years. I would highly recommend buying this product</li>
            <li> I have a beauty supply warehouse nearby and have tried so many shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners. After awhile, they stopped working on my colored hair and leave my hair limp. Since I have my hair colored blond, for some reason my hair turns into one solid clump of a tangled mess after shampooing. I have tried numerous conditioners and nothing get the clumps out, I end up in the shower for 15 minutes dumping everything I can find to desperately get the knots out. After trying this, I found it in T.J. Maxx at a small discount, I was hooked. I will never use anything else. My hair comes out like silk and I leave the conditioner on my hair for 5 minutes and every knot falls out. I love it and my hair comes out the same way every time I wash it. I will NEVER buy anything else but this shampoo. I hope the company doesn&#x27;t come along and get bought out and then the product is discontinued or cheapened. This happened with a company that I loved their hairspray, here today and gone tomorrow.</li>
            <li> The shampoo made my scalp and hair feel really clean, but it was really watery. The conditioner was okay. It didn&#x27;t help with smoothing out the tangles in my&lt;br /&gt;hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the big bottles that came together and the oil treatment. I wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo product and ended up buying this one from amazon. I have thick, wavy hair and always have a ton of fly-aways. I really didn&#x27;t see much difference in the condition or texture of my hair after using these products. It smells nice. I did not like the way the argon oil smelled, however.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes my scalp gets really itchy, but I noticed not so much while using this shampoo. I don&#x27;t know what else to say about it. It&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, it did the job. My hair didn&#x27;t fall out. But, it wasn&#x27;t the miracle cure I was looking for. I&#x27;ll likely go back to $5 store brands.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic and sulfate free! But I can&#x27;t use it on it&#x27;s own. I have to use a different shampoo just because this weighs my bleached, long thin hair down too much. But...I absolutely love using the conditioner as a shaving cream! I would buy it again for that alone. I ordered mine from beauty spot and they sent a good product-not watered down.</li>
            <li> On my third set of these in about a 2 year time frame. Love this product! Have referred three friends to these three items and they have not switched yet, either.</li>
            <li> I really like all the products in this bundle.  The shampoo lathers well and within minutes, I hear my hair &#x27;squeak&#x27; and I know it has washed out all of my hair products and my hair is squeaky clean. The mask is wonderful for me. My color treated hair tends to be very dry and leaving this in my hair for several minutes seems to help a lot. I use the small bottle of oil exactly like the directions say and I am very pleased with the moisture it&#x27;s putting back in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 3 month...but it only took a few days to notice my hair was softer and generally looks alot healthier. I have used Herbal essensces, Joico, Head &amp; shoukders, etc...but this really does everything for me. Thanks, i will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> At this point I can not see the benefit. The shampoo makes the hair feel matte. Not sure about it foe the price.</li>
            <li> I just received my shipment a few days ago.  Today was my first day using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with dull hair.  My hair usually feels soft and beautiful, but it never has that shine that some women have.  I purchased products that add shine (spray on products), but my hair is oily to begin with, and adding these products tends to bring out the oil in my hair much more quickly.  And I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the shininess when I used the spray on shine products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I color treated my hair a few weeks ago, and it was shiny for about a week and a half.  But that didn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother has been telling me I should order WEN from QVC.  But I just can&#x27;t justify spending $30 on a 16 oz product that will last approximately one month (not to mention the shipping).  I don&#x27;t spend that kind of money on my hair.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do use quality products in my life.  I switched from drug store make-ups a few years ago to Bare Minerals and will never go back.  But my makeup lasts a long time so I can justify the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend at work told me to try the Loreal sulfate free products, and I did buy them, but haven&#x27;t used them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to Amazon and did a search for sulfate free, and one of the products to pop up was Dermorganic.  I read the reviews, and people seem to love this product!  I looked at it for a few weeks.  One person comments that although the name Organic is in the title, this product is not organic.  I guess that would be a problem if you tried to purchase products that were certified organic, but to me that doesn&#x27;t matter.  The foods I eat aren&#x27;t organic, so I don&#x27;t care whether or not the products I use externally are organic (I know I probably should care, but I don&#x27;t have the money to convert to all organic products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, its time for me to get to my point.  The shampoo and masque (conditioner) get great reviews here on Amazon.  I found a set that came with 33.8 oz of shampoo and 33.8 oz of conditioner here on Amazon for about $45.  Then I stumbled on this \\&quot;Backbar Kit\\&quot; which comes with 33.8 oz of shampoo, 33.8 oz of conditioner and 4 oz of leave in oil which contains argan oil (its not 100% argan oil like some other products here on Amazon).  This Backbar Kit was only $3 more than the kit with the shampoo and conditioner, and I was getting a 4 oz leave in treatment. I thought, wow, with this being such a great price, I HAVE TO try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what do I think of it?  WOW, my hair is truly soft.  AND SHINY!!!!  I used the shampoo, rinsed it out, then put the masque in for a few minutes while I finished my shower, and rinsed that out.  I used a product containing argan oil before (it was $20 for 4 oz, made by Healthy Sexy Hair, the company that makes Big Sexy Hair), so I knew how to use it.  I brushed my wet hair and put it up in a towel.  I then applied my makeup and deodorant.  By the time I was done with that, my  hair was damp so I put a dime size amount of the oil in my palm.  I rubbed my hands together, and applied the oil first to my ends (to avoid splitting), and then to the rest of my hair.  I blew my hair dry, and I must say it SMELLS AMAZING!  And it is shiny!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today as I come to review this product, the price has gone up.  It says its $59 ($11 more than I paid), but still free shipping.  It really is worth that price.  I love the way my hair smells and looks!mazon for about $45.  Then I stumbled on this \\&quot;Backbar Kit\\&quot; which comes with 33.8 oz of shampoo, 33.8 oz of conditioner and 4 oz of leave in oil which contains argan oil (its not 100% argan oil like some other products here on Amazon).

            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think that something with \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in it would leave your hair so soft, and not \\&quot;oily,\\&quot; but this product does.  I&#x27;ve been buying it in smaller sizes and this time decided to go for the biggest size, which is the most reasonably priced.  Really does a good job and now a couple of my friends are using it as well.</li>
            <li> Ok, lumpy product won&#x27;t come out of the pump.</li>
            <li> My first purchase with this exact backbar set was through a local Malys. My 2nd and subsequent 3rd purchase via Amazon. My first purchase via Amazon was delivered by tossing the box over my fence (yes, I personally witnessed this) and finding the bottles busted open. It was apparent that the bottles had previously been compromised and not only because the package was thrown over my fence. The packaging was hardly sufficient. I was going to keep the package although I was irritated at the lack of full bottles of product but when I discovered the shampoo to have the consistency of being watered down so I opted to return the damaged package and re-order a new one. Before I placed my order, I spoke with several people about my concerns with insufficient packaging because I didn&#x27;t want a repeat of receiving broken bottles. I even wrote a note to the person packaging the item. All of my concerns fell on deaf ears because I received my package with the same amount of insufficient packaging!! Not only that, I really unhappy to find the shampoo has the same watered-down consistency. So, if you ask if I&#x27;m happy, I have to say no! Not on any account. Not with the way my order was handled, not with my concerns not being addressed, and not with the consistency of the product.</li>
            <li> Was nervous about trying this cause i have oily hair but this works wonderfully. It makes your hair so soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> I started using DermOrganic shampoo, masque, and oil treatment last year, and fell in love instantly. The scent is great, and I can really see a difference in how my hair responds to heat styling. When it came time to order more, I found this kit on Amazon and thought that it was a great deal, since this is the same price I paid last year for a kit with half the amount of shampoo and masque.     Since I&#x27;ve been using this company&#x27;s products for a while, I&#x27;m familiar with how thick the shampoo is supposed to be. The shampoo that I received was clearly diluted. The shampoo is substantial and a squirt of it should be able to rest in the palm of your upturned hand without running over the sides. This stuff was not capable of doing that. The masque was fine and I didn&#x27;t try the oil treatment, but I was really disappointed in how runny the shampoo was.    I highly recommend that anybody interested in this company&#x27;s awesome shampoo and conditioner find a place to buy it where it won&#x27;t be watered down.</li>
            <li> I will never use another shampoo! I have been using this product for 9 months with no other shampoos or conditioners and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair! It has grown super fast and always looks clean never greasy. If you&#x27;re like me, you change/rotate store bought shampoos as your hair adjusts to them, causing over-production of oil at the roots, giving you a &amp;#34;grease release&amp;#34;. I use the Masque once or twice a week on the ends of my hair. It leaves your hair very soft and shiny but if I use it too regularly, it weighs my hair down. So, I have re-ordered the shampoo and in 9 months have used 1.25 bottles - it goes a LONG way. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever need to purchase another masque at this rate &#x3D;) This shampoo is amazing! This family of 6 is going DermOrganic for good &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have bought this same product in the past and been completely happy.  But, when I received the package, the exterior box was soaking wet.  Upon opening the box, the oil had completely leaked out and was empty.  The shampoo had started to leak out as well.  Besides just the issue with the packaging, the shampoo is so terribly watered down.  I have had this product before and know the consistancy should not be that of water.  If I could give 0 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> At first I was satisfied with this product and overlooked the fact that the shampoo is indeed watered down!  But the more I use it and see the clearly watered down shampoo in my hand each time I wash my hair the angrier I get!  I thought Amazon would rectify this situation as other people have commented on the same thing.  I tried \\&quot;mixing\\&quot; the shampoo thinking maybe it was thicker at the top, but that is not the case.  I was duped by this!  At first I thought I deserved it because it was such a good deal, but I paid money for this and if I wanted watered down shampoo I could have done that myself for a lot cheaper shampoos out there!  I gave it one star because I had to and because I do like the conditioner!  Do not buy this product from this seller.  I now see they have a liter duo on here and maybe that is better and not water for shampoo!  It is NOT supposed to be water--but thick shampoo!!!  I am angry and disappointed in the company that sent it to me and for Amazon for continuing to sell it!</li>
            <li> I give this product two stars Instead of one only because Amazon took it back. A leaked shampoo and conditioner all over the packaging. The shampoo was diluted. I have used Dermorganics for over a year and never have I seen this consistency.  In general, I like this shampoo and conditioner. Save yourself the trouble of having to return this and find another retailer</li>
            <li> I saw that my beautician used this product and my hair was always so soft. Now that I can have it at home my hair is always soft.</li>
            <li> Great product gentle but effective</li>
            <li> Will never use another shampoo.  I have naturally wavy hair.  I am also starting to turn gray.  Derm Organic keeps my unruly waves controlled and doesn&#x27;t take away the body as some relaxing shampoo does.  I love all three of the producgts in this Kit and don&#x27;t know what I did before I found this great product.</li>
            <li> I have used the products twice since my purchase. The shampoo is amazing. The hair masque, also amazing, and the oil treatment...amazing! 33oz bottles that I expect to last for months. Totally worth it. I have long, thick, and curly hair. These products do exactly what I needed them to do. They gently clean, moisturize, add shine and have left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I love DermOrganic products! They leave my hair shiny, strong and healthy. The shampoo is super gentle and the conditioner really works well for tangles. I use the oil treatment on my curly hair it works wonders for my curls. Haven&#x27;t seen my hair this healthy in decades! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My hair had become dry and lifeless. I had trouble finding a mousse or gel or root lifter that solved all the problems. For the past 4 days since I began using all 3 products, my hair is shiny and has body and I haven&#x27;t needed a mousse or root lifter! Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> The Shampoo and Masque makes my hair feel and look so healthy!  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their hair look brand new!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these products for a couple of weeks.  I ordered at the recommendation of a friend.  So far I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the products themselves, but the  pump for the conditioner was broken.  This is a  huge bottle to have to use without the pump.  You would think such a great product would have better  packaging.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best kit for the money on the market! I have extremely sensitive skin and this shampoo and conditioner are amazing! The shampoo is moisturizing without weighing my naturally curly hair down and its safe for color treated hair, which is major plus! The conditioner is wonderful and glides right through my hair. I&#x27;m a huge user of organic products and this backbar kit fits the bill! The best part about this line is everything they make is sulfate free and not tested on animals, which is very important to me. I also love the argan hair oil which I put on my my damp hair right after I get out of the shower and its smells wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down like I&#x27;ve noticed with other argan hair oil products on the market. I also love that the kit comes with a bonus hair spray which is the best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used. My curls look flawless with zero frizz. Buy this kit, you won&#x27;t regret it! A totally fantastic deal with a great priced attached to it.  Please don&#x27;t get rid of this kit Amazon!! I&#x27;ve searched and searched for great hair products for curly hair and now I can finally say that I&#x27;ve stopped searching!!!! :)</li>
            <li> This is expensive, watery, and unused in my bathroom cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend buying this haircare set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are much better items at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I am not allowed to use shampoo with sulfate in it. This shampoo is organic and doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemical in it. I love shampoo that bubbles up and gets foamy. This one does no because its missing the key ingredients to do that. I miss the foaming. I feel like my hair is not as clean because I don&#x27;t see and feel the bubbles coming up. Another downside is that the shampoo really smells. There is no fragrance in it so it doesn&#x27;t smell nice and pretty. It will stink up my house after I use it. And the smell stays in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner works really well. Your hair is much softer after using it. I cam tell the difference from my old conditioner. You can run your fingers through it. The smell is not as bad as the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will say that I absolutely love the oil treatment that came in the set! It makes my hair softer, and shiny, and protects it from heat tools. It&#x27;s my favorite part of the set. Since I have a lot of hair I have been going through everything pretty fast, however I think it will last longer for someone with less hair and thinner hair than mine.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years and it keeps my color treated hair so healthy and shiny. I have run out and procrastinated reordering I have tried a few much pricier salon products but I always see a huge difference. I will never run out of Dermorganics again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so unhappy with this shampoo! It doesn&#x27;t foam well. The shampoo is very liquid for a regular shampoo. I need to take three whole palms to wash my hair. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair either. But the masque and oil are good though. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t what I excepted with reference to the reviews on the Internet.</li>
            <li> Pros- silky hair for 1+ week&lt;br /&gt;Cons - it&#x27;s not this cheap in stores&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend for natural hair women</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this in her salon and I loved it but it was too expensive in the salon. Found this great deal on amazon for the whole kit. Love it great product....</li>
            <li> Been using for a couple of years.  Need to wash with a clarifying shampoo every 3-4 washes.  all three products have dimethicone in them and it can build up.  Taking a break with other sulfate free shampoo lines right now but will use again.  Hair just needs a change every now and then.  I and my 3 daughters continue to use the oil treatment.  All four of us have long hair of varying degrees of fine or course, straight or curly.  All of us have had great improvements in the health of our hair since beginning to use this product.  It did coincide with our termination of the use of sulfates so that may be the biggest reason for the improvement, but must give credit where due.</li>
            <li> Love these products.  Hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my hair feel and look. I have used it for 1 week now and see a huge difference in before and after photos.</li>
            <li> So sorry to say that the condition of the product was a mess. The bottles were leaking and the shampo was watery....not thick like it should be. Unfortunately they were returned. I did find the shampoo and hair masque locally, and love these products for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter had given me a sample of this product and I liked it so much that I ordered the kit.  I received the order fast and with no hassle.  This hair product is sulfate free and leaves my hair clean and manageable.  I do not use the oil every day as it would weigh my fine hair down too much but it is nice a couple times a week to counteract damage from styling.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen Lavender for several years.  I started noticing that my scalp was flaking and itchy.  I did some searching on Amazon, and found DermOrganic&#x27;s products.  Decided to give it a try.  WOW!!  (Please research the negative reviews.  You will see they mostly reflect a bad SELLER, not the product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, if you use Wen, you are accustomed to the no lather effect.  DermOrganic gives you back some lather.  Not like a regular shampoo, but way more than Wen.  Just feels better!  And the smell!!!!  Oh I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, no more using 20-30 pumps depending on your hair length.  This is like a \\&quot;normal serving\\&quot; lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, no more waiting for 20 -30 mins as with Wen.  Shampoo, rinse &amp; throw on some of the awesome conditioner, rinse, and your done.  Ta da!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine thin straight hair.  I was a little leery of the Argon Oil treatment.  So I put a weensy drop of the the Argon oil in my palms, rubbed it very well, and then worked it through my wet hair.  Blow dried, and was amazed.  The shine is awesome, and the fresh feeling of the hair is amazing!  No oily look, just shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for five washing&#x27;s now.  (I go three to four days in between).  I wanted to make sure I really liked if after a few washing&#x27;s before rating.  I love it!!  I&#x27;ve gotten two friends to try mine and then they both ordered it also!  The smell is wonderful, the feeling of my hair is outstanding.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Finally, hair products that make my hair soft and I&#x27;ve tried everything. The leave in oil is one of the best smelling products out there.  The icing I the cake is this is also a great value. The company shipped it very promptly.  I had no problem with l leaking or watered down shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love these products. I have thick, coarse, straight hair that is highlighted every 6 weeks or so.  I noticed a lot of breakage and split ends that I attributed to the hair color, so decided to try this product to bring my hair back to good health.  Used regularly, my hair is softer and with significantly less breakage and fewer split ends. I like this scent of this product much better than many others.  The leave on treatment gives my hair a pretty shine without build-up.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My the year old daughter had curly hair and this help control the frizz. I color my hair and my color lasts much longer than with regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> Initially I was so impressed with the DermOrganic set (shampoo, masque, and oil treatment). My hair was silky and shiny and felt the way it does when you first walk out of a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that the shampoo was very runny. However, I just don&#x27;t believe that a company would water it down. I took off the pump and noticed that the shampoo around and in the pump was solid, and the shampoo had only a small lane to flow. The shampoo in the bottle was very thick (and pearlescent, as another reviewer mentioned), but when pumped through the pump it came out runny. Unfortunately, the pump also quit working. The company could definately improve on the packaging (how about a squeeze bottle similar to the Aveda liters?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy the way the products make my hair feel and look, however, I am having some scalp issues and am unsure if it is caused by the DermOrganic products. I am going to take a hiatus from them and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I am very picky with regards to what I wash my hair with and this product gets an A+.  My stylest introduced me to it and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since.  Even my husband fell in love with it.  It does a great job removing the styling products and the masque does a great job of replenishing the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo, conditioner &amp; treatment I have EVER used!!! I have tried so many products through out the years it&#x27;s ridiculous. Not only is my hair super soft &amp; shiny but my dry, flaky scalp is gone! And I have only used it twice!!!! Free of all the harmful ingredients &amp; full of magic! I pray it will always be in production. Try it! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Check out dermorganic s web site. If your distributer is not listed then it&#x27;s simple.  You get eat you pay for. I think that sums it up. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Better value than buying separately and its nice to have the really large size. If you have long hair, you&#x27;ll need it!</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for quite a while and love it. Great return policy with Amazon meant I was able to order again and have sent to a family member that does not have local access.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. This is the first time I have ordered it rather than buying from a local salon. It does not seem like the same quality. Makes my hair feel sticky and gross.</li>
            <li> love this product, been buying for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, lots of it, though.  the shampoo was great, the Masque is a bit heavy, so i only use it once a week.  The oil is also a bit heavy for my hair, but overall i love all three products.  It also has taken me about 3 months to get almost thru the shampoo, and my husband and kids have all used it some, too.</li>
