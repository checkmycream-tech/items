            <li>plus I have my own brushes I like to use.</li>
            <li>The name HiP (high intensity pigments) is definitely fitting as the product has a very good color pay off.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the color of the eyeshadow and it&#x27;s blending properties.</li>
            <li>but I am glad this is in my bag.</li>

            <li>A beautiful dark red with a teal shimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful duochrome, a dark brown with a blue shift.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product is loose and not a pressed powder, it makes it easier for application.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t put too much on your brush.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>No thanks, I did a quick google search for &amp;#34;best drugstore makeup pigments&amp;#34; and luckily I did because it led me back to LOreal</li>

            <li> it is actually really good-usually I never use brushes that come with things, as they usually suck</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to check out the other shades in this collection.</li>
            <li> I am so so so so excited to have found out about this again, I would use it religiously maybe 5 years ago, and then i just went cold turkey and stopped wearing makeup for a while.</li>
            <li> Apparently all these comments have been saying the stuff is discontinued :/</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I ordered just the other day</li>
            <li> I threw most of my stuff away, and until recently i was looking for some pigment and saw the insane prices MAC wanted.</li>
            <li> Decent staying power, with primer it starts to crease badly around the 10 hour mark.</li>
            <li> Sad when it was discontinued!</li>
            <li> Just ur base color</li>
            <li> It picks up the base colors undertones.</li>

            <li> I enjoyed the color of the eyeshadow and it&#x27;s blending properties. I don&#x27;t use make up that often but I am glad this is in my bag.</li>
            <li> This pigment allows you to do a 2 step Smokey eye!  Just ur base color and this is all you need. It picks up the base colors undertones.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase, I have used this product before and love it.  I can never seem to find it at the store.  I ordered just the other day and I already received my item.  Very Happy!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Sad when it was discontinued! Thankful to have found a supplier. I get lots of compliments each time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product is loose and not a pressed powder, it makes it easier for application. However, I did think there would be more of the product, hence the 4 stars. The picture makes it look like the product container is much larger than it actually is. The name HiP (high intensity pigments) is definitely fitting as the product has a very good color pay off. Overall I really love the product. I just wish it came in a larger size!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous shade, and I cannot find these anywhere!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Great colors and price!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I use this under my bottom lashes. I love it! Makes my eyes pop. :]</li>
            <li> for Mac Blue Brown.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the color and application.  Going to be hard to find in the future, but I&#x27;m glad I got to try it for a small commitment and will enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> A beautiful dark red with a teal shimmer. Decent staying power, with primer it starts to crease badly around the 10 hour mark. A little bit goes a LONG way. I am definitely going to check out the other shades in this collection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  great. Has the holes inside so you don&#x27;t put too much on your brush.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t blend as well as it used to but that may be because it&#x27;s an old product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was still happy to receicve it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, accurate description of product.</li>
            <li> Product showed up exactly as what I ordered.  Beautiful color and in its original packaging applicator brush included.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> It is a great pigment and the perfect size.  I use it in several different looks already.  It was everything I hoped for.</li>
            <li> This pigment is a dupe of the MAC Blue Brown pigment. It&#x27;s incredibly pigmented, and goes on beautifully. I use it with an eyeshadow primer to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t crease or fade through the day, and I have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked everywhere, and it seems that my favorite eye shadow is not being sold anymore! So, thankfully, I found it here! The sale was quick and easy, and it shipped quickly!</li>
