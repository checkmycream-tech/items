            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Oribe products but didn&#x27;t expect it to smell this good.</li>
            <li>Does make your hair smell good in between washings.</li>
            <li>I can spray it on my funky unwashed hair and it smells good when I swish it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for shampoos that smell good but</li>
            <li>It refreshes your hair and smells so good.</li>
            <li>But I would say give it a try if you continue to look for a really good hair refresher.</li>
            <li>This spray smells so freaking good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I splurged on this; it&#x27;s so conditioning and smells great.</li>

            <li>LOVE THIS SCENT!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest that they put a picture of the can beside something that will give an honest perspective on the size of the can.</li>
            <li>The Oribe hair Refresher is great for a quick pick me up for hair that has been around smoke or areas where food have been prepared that linger into you hair.  </li>
            <li>This smells Great and refreshes really well!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>and so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is something out there.</li>
            <li>I read in a beauty magazine article, this spray would help with static electricity in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am offering the information for others looking for help with static.</li>
            <li>I love oribes signature smell.</li>
            <li>I love this spray...</li>
            <li>the smell doesn&#x27;t last, I don&#x27;t use product in my hair so this is perfect for me -- it doesn&#x27;t affect your hair at all.</li>
            <li>I get SO many compliments, it eliminates odors like smoke, food smells, etc.  </li>
            <li>I gave it to my daughters, they seem to think it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>I love this oribe product.  </li>
            <li>Hit snooze too many times, and now there no time to shampoo?</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as it was recommended for static, but even with light usage the perfume was so strong that I had to tie my hair up in a winter hat, and my husband couldn&#x27;t be around me.  </li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair that I often wear straight, and spraying this hydrates and conditions my hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Amazing product fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I ordered two more right away.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t stink, it&#x27;s just a very strong perfumey smell.</li>
            <li>but it lasts and it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I love the scent I guess the first use I over did it.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I save it for special occasions -- it&#x27;s kinda pricey</li>
            <li>I know that it says 1.6oz on the container and in the description, but I was assuming I would be getting a full sized container of product at this steep price.</li>
            <li>The true test was after I walked out of a smoky bar, I spritzed some in my hair....</li>
            <li>I can use much a much cheaper brand that works much better.</li>
            <li>I love Oribe products and decided to give this a try the main reason is to cover up the smell of smoke, camp fires ,cookouts etc</li>
            <li>this is absolutely  awesome for covering the nasty smell of smoke and I was so impressed</li>
            <li>I bought mine from another site that offered free shipping, so google around first.</li>
            <li>Really though, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just perfume.</li>
            <li>It is great, a little pricey</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>For some individuals, it might be worth the price.</li>
            <li>I can get away with fresh smelling hair in between washes.  </li>
            <li>I, too, read a lot of positive reviews about this, particularly the smell, and I LOVE scents.</li>
            <li>Im very sensitive to strong scents and the first time I used this</li>
            <li>It actually creates static.  </li>
            <li>I first was introduced to this by my hair stylist</li>
            <li>I really love this spray,I purchased this with low expectations</li>
            <li>wow was it overly strong ,I was ready to give it away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, just costly for the bottle size I think, so I use very little, it doesn&#x27;t really work that we&#x27;ll on the static, which is the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>and if you are super sensitive to perfumes and just can&#x27;t for whatever reason tolerate them you may want to skip this product.</li>
            <li>Tried to use to prolong a blowout for an additional day - did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>I have light blonde hair and when I apply this &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; it makes my hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li>It really covers up sweat/smoke/etc.</li>
            <li>The scent filled the entire house, and lingered for hours.</li>
            <li>It really does refresh your hair after 2 days of not washing it.  </li>
            <li>It really does clean my hair and give me a day or so of skipping the daily hair washing routine.</li>
            <li>especially see this coming in handy in the winter months, since my hair gets very dry and static-y.</li>
            <li>The smell is very classy as well; somewhat fruity but not in an immature &amp;#34;I just ate candy&amp;#34; way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>much so the next day I just applied three sprays very small ones and brushed through my hair and seemed to be perfect not overwhelming  by the scent at all.</li>
            <li>wow the smell..</li>
            <li>I definitely  recommend this just be careful how much you use at first</li>
            <li>giving my hair a funny texture like some other reviewers.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This is not a dry shampoo, and it doesn&#x27;t claim to be, so I don&#x27;t know why people were expecting oil</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but this does and it really refreshes dull looking hair.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers say it leaves their hair greasy; duh, vitamin E is one of the first ingredients.</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling greasy &amp; stiff.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other types of hair.</li>
            <li> gets a bit heavy by the end of the day</li>
            <li> I have thick medium length black hair that I blow out.</li>
            <li> Usually scents don&#x27;t stick to my hair</li>
            <li> Never heard of vitamin E not being in a thick oily form before.</li>
            <li> I really was hoping I would like this product, however, it has what I would call  a very unpleasant fragrance that stay with you for what seems like forever.</li>
            <li> However, please note that the bottle is very, very small.  </li>
            <li> I will just have to keep washing my hair until I find a product that is less expensive and works as well.</li>
            <li> I do have to say though, that I was shocked when I opened the packaging to find this tiny, almost sample sized container.</li>
            <li> very bad product, makes my hair dirty- greasy looking, and i have almost all of Oribe , and usually i really like the brand.</li>
            <li> I know I was a little shocked when I opened my package.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>

            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this product.  It makes my hair smell amazing!!!!  I read about this product and thought I would give it a try and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I like this product. It really does clean my hair and give me a day or so of skipping the daily hair washing routine. I do have to say though, that I was shocked when I opened the packaging to find this tiny, almost sample sized container. I know that it says 1.6oz on the container and in the description, but I was assuming I would be getting a full sized container of product at this steep price. I would suggest that they put a picture of the can beside something that will give an honest perspective on the size of the can. Because of this issue, I will not purchase this again. This is highway robbery, and the reason I am giving the product only 3 stars. If you want to pay a lot for something like this it works great. I will just have to keep washing my hair until I find a product that is less expensive and works as well. I&#x27;m sure there is something out there.</li>
            <li> gets a bit heavy by the end of the day</li>
            <li> I read in a beauty magazine article, this spray would help with static electricity in my hair. It actually creates static.  I am offering the information for others looking for help with static. Don&#x27;t look for help from this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I reorder it all the time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, just costly for the bottle size I think, so I use very little, it doesn&#x27;t really work that we&#x27;ll on the static, which is the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> very bad product, makes my hair dirty- greasy looking, and i have almost all of Oribe , and usually i really like the brand. dont waist your money on this one.</li>
            <li> wow the smell.. I&#x27;ve used Oribe products but didn&#x27;t expect it to smell this good. Usually scents don&#x27;t stick to my hair but this does and it really refreshes dull looking hair. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times.  Does make your hair smell good in between washings.</li>
            <li> I love oribes signature smell. I love this spray... I can spray it on my funky unwashed hair and it smells good when I swish it. Recommend!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! The true test was after I walked out of a smoky bar, I spritzed some in my hair....VOILA....no smoke smell!!! I smelled like Oribe...fresh and fragrant!!!</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for my hair.  Tried to use to prolong a blowout for an additional day - did absolutely nothing and did not refresh my hair as promised in the name!</li>
            <li> I followed my co-worker around the office til she finally told me what it was. I&#x27;m always looking for shampoos that smell good but the smell doesn&#x27;t last, I don&#x27;t use product in my hair so this is perfect for me -- it doesn&#x27;t affect your hair at all. I love it so much that I save it for special occasions -- it&#x27;s kinda pricey but it lasts and it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair and when I apply this &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; it makes my hair look greasy.  I can use much a much cheaper brand that works much better.</li>
            <li> Oribe Cote d&#x27;azur hair refresher&lt;br /&gt;Had a very nice smell, but it made my hair feel like it needed an immediate shampoo, I probably would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to this by my hair stylist and I buy it every month.  It smells AMAZING.  I get SO many compliments, it eliminates odors like smoke, food smells, etc.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Some people might like this, but I don&#x27;t. I bought it because it was recommended to me for staticky hair. It doesn&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s an aerosol can so it surrounds your head with a foggy cloud when you spray it. I also thought the smell was overpowering. It certainly doesn&#x27;t stink, it&#x27;s just a very strong perfumey smell. I gave it to my daughters, they seem to think it&#x27;s ok. Really though, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just perfume. They just put it in an aerosol can &amp; say it&#x27;s for your hair.</li>
            <li> This product smells and works great. I have a best friend that is a hair stylist and she recommend it and I am now hooked  ORIBE products.</li>
            <li> I, too, read a lot of positive reviews about this, particularly the smell, and I LOVE scents. No. No on the scent, no on the product, this product literally did nothing for me. NOTHING. Not refresh, not make it smell better, nothing! I have thick medium length black hair that I blow out. Maybe it works for other types of hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It refreshes your hair and smells so good. People were stopping me to ask what perfume I was wearing but it was just my hair.</li>
            <li> Did not care for this spray because of the smell &amp; consistency. Left my hair feeling greasy &amp; stiff. will not buy again</li>
            <li> This smells Great and refreshes really well! However, please note that the bottle is very, very small.  I know I was a little shocked when I opened my package. But I would say give it a try if you continue to look for a really good hair refresher. For some individuals, it might be worth the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing product fast shipping! Love the smell</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and freshens hair but it is a bit pricey</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  Smells wonderful.  Would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> This spray smells so freaking good. It really covers up sweat/smoke/etc. smells in your hair. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it giving my hair a funny texture like some other reviewers. My only issue is that the cap was taped on (for shipping) and it left a gross residue on the can and cap. Oh well.</li>
            <li> DID NOT CARE FOR THE SCENT</li>
            <li> great for refreshing hair after workout or any time you want you hair to smell wonderful. LOVE THIS SCENT!</li>
            <li> OMG!! This stuff is amazing! And it smells terrific!!!!</li>
            <li> The Oribe hair Refresher is great for a quick pick me up for hair that has been around smoke or areas where food have been prepared that linger into you hair.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> Do not like the smell at all.Did not do anything at all for my hair.</li>
            <li> I really was hoping I would like this product, however, it has what I would call  a very unpleasant fragrance that stay with you for what seems like forever.</li>
            <li> dont like it, leaves my hair ashy</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Smells amazing !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as it was recommended for static, but even with light usage the perfume was so strong that I had to tie my hair up in a winter hat, and my husband couldn&#x27;t be around me.  The scent filled the entire house, and lingered for hours.</li>
            <li> Smells divine!! Covers up any smell from days of not washing hair.</li>
            <li> I love this oribe product.  It really does refresh your hair after 2 days of not washing it.  Would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Hit snooze too many times, and now there no time to shampoo? No problem. This product will revive yesterday&#x27;s hair in seconds. It smells like a dream, and you&#x27;re the only one who will know about your sans shower morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I can get away with fresh smelling hair in between washes.  It is great, a little pricey so I&#x27;m hoping this lasts a while!!</li>
            <li> I really love this spray,I purchased this with low expectations but I was wrong.I love Oribe products and decided to give this a try the main reason is to cover up the smell of smoke, camp fires ,cookouts etc and it works.Im very sensitive to strong scents and the first time I used this wow was it overly strong ,I was ready to give it away but I figured I used to much so the next day I just applied three sprays very small ones and brushed through my hair and seemed to be perfect not overwhelming  by the scent at all.I love the scent I guess the first use I over did it.This doesn&#x27;t  leave my hair with a sticky feeling or a greasy look this is absolutely  awesome for covering the nasty smell of smoke and I was so impressed I ordered two more right away.I definitely  recommend this just be careful how much you use at first if you never used this and if you are super sensitive to perfumes and just can&#x27;t for whatever reason tolerate them you may want to skip this product.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m so glad I splurged on this; it&#x27;s so conditioning and smells great. Some other reviewers say it leaves their hair greasy; duh, vitamin E is one of the first ingredients. Never heard of vitamin E not being in a thick oily form before. This is not a dry shampoo, and it doesn&#x27;t claim to be, so I don&#x27;t know why people were expecting oil absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair that I often wear straight, and spraying this hydrates and conditions my hair wonderfully. I brush it through to the ends and I almost look like I stepped out of a Pantene commercial. The smell is very classy as well; somewhat fruity but not in an immature &amp;#34;I just ate candy&amp;#34; way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially see this coming in handy in the winter months, since my hair gets very dry and static-y. One bottle should last at least a year, so it&#x27;s worth the money in that regard. I bought mine from another site that offered free shipping, so google around first.</li>
