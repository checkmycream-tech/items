            <li> Have used this product for many years and was very happy to find it at such a reasonable price.  It&#x27;s the ZP11 in the cream that does the  trick.</li>

It was really expensive also because they no longer make it.  Not sure I would suggest it.  BUt it does have a nice smell and can be used as a nice hair lotion</li>
            <li> Was happy to finally find this product again  -- not satisfied with the price  -- but I blame Revlon for discontinuing it -- not the sellor.</li>
