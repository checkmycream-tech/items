            <li>(good reviews in 2011) but seem to have substituted henna for indigo and selling it as indigo.  </li>

            <li>I liked this product.</li>

            <li>Nice dye release, very finely sifted.  </li>
            <li>Very fine powder that makes for a very smooth and silky mix.</li>
            <li>With the ease of using this product, I was able to get the result I wanted.  </li>
            <li>but it is worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt to make sure the indigo clings to the henna.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Over the years as I got more and more gray, I had to use more indigo.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am happy I found some thing natural.</li>
            <li>This indigo powder really gives good coverage for gray hair.</li>
            <li>Zenia is a fine quality indigo.</li>
            <li>The result is a gorgeous black  color that covers my grey beautifully.</li>
            <li>I normally buy 1000 gm package, but they did not carry in crop 2012, so I paid more money and bought 500 gm package.</li>
            <li>Good Seller, but this batch was not as good as last one, did not get the expected color, even though it said crop from 2012.</li>
            <li>Beautiful dye release in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Over all the product was good, but not very much.</li>
            <li>A blend of the two gives me a lovely, rich deep auburn.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are easy and clear to follow.</li>
            <li>years later I will be glad I have made the switch.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I finally did a two-step dye job with a better quality henna and this indigo powder.</li>
            <li>Have been getting results from just one use - healthy and stronger hair when mixed with henna.</li>
            <li>This indigo came exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The first bag I bought was no problem, every batch I prepared cured within 15 to 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t the problem with the first bag</li>
            <li>Not only is the price reasonable, the quality is better...goes on smoother &amp; the results give me better coverage and a richer color.</li>
            <li>It comes in a convenient big package eliminating the need to open different bags to reach an ideal wight.</li>

            <li>it is not the 100 % pure indigoferra tinctoria  indigo powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried this product and am pleased with the use of it compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>My hear feels much healthier, they don&#x27;t give me irritated scalp like I would often get from chemical treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li>Item arrived in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>Outer bag was the foil, that is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a lot of videos on line that are very helpful in researching this process and may help you determine if this process will work for you.</li>
            <li>it and does not give the true  blue indigo color,  which i did get from the indigo powder,</li>
            <li>I am going to buy a new supply soon !</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t make much mess any more.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of a natural hair product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yes it is messy but you will get used to and get better</li>
            <li>I have been using Indigo Powder for a few months along with the Zenia Henna powder and and love it</li>
            <li>It was slightly messy but compare to other brands, this is 100% more user friendly.</li>
            <li>The result is a dark brown hair color that covers my grey nicely.</li>
            <li>I used Nupur brand henna and got a gorgeous deep red on my grays but no sign of black from this indigo powder.  </li>
            <li>No more chemicals on my hair any more.</li>
            <li>first time I tried this I mixed it with Henna which produced zero results.  </li>
            <li>I use it frequently after a Henna deep conditioning, or mixed with 1/3 of Henna to get a nice deep brown color.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that just a rinse out won&#x27;t do, it&#x27;s essential to shampoo well afterwards to remove all of the Indigo debris.  </li>
            <li>Until now I had no idea of its true quality because the henna that I mixed with it had a very low dye content.</li>
            <li>The more indigo you mix in, the darker the color will be and less red.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this Indigo if any one wants black color for their hair to cover their grey color. .</li>
            <li>The next day just before you are ready to start, mix the indigo and then mix the indigo into the henna.</li>

            <li>After years of applying  chemical color to my hair I wanted to try some thing natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My grays were not completely covered after doing the two-step process (henna first, then indigo).</li>
            <li>Pure henna makes your hair orange, while indigo mmakes it pure black.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with a sensitivity to commercial hair dyes.</li>
            <li>It is messy and takes more time than packaged hair rinses or dyes but the results last longer and don&#x27;t irritate my scalp like the commercial hair dyes and rinses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The powder mixes into a nice smooth paste not like others which were gritty and difficult to apply as bits keep dropping off and making a mess on me, the sink, and floor.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m nearly all white, I use a 50/50 mix.  </li>
            <li>First off, when you mix it with water and a little salt and let it sit, it is supposed to turn black/blue after about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This website is a great resource for coloring your hair with henna and indigo: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the indigo with this henna product:</li>
            <li>As I write this I have another test mixture in a porcelein bowl sitting next to me, its been mixed and sitting for about 15 minutes now and no sign of black or blue, only a lovely bottle green.  </li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to PPD in hair dye and other products.  </li>

            <li> I was getting tired of using chemical hair color, but henna by itself would not cover my grey with my naturally dark hair. So after some research I chose to use henna and indigo. I know it takes long (2 hours for henna and 30 mins for indigo, double process!!!) but it is worthwhile. My hear feels much healthier, they don&#x27;t give me irritated scalp like I would often get from chemical treatment. Yes it is messy but you will get used to and get better, I don&#x27;t make much mess any more. I have totally switched to these products about a year now and planning to continue, thinking years later I will be glad I have made the switch.</li>
            <li> This is the best quality Indigo I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I&#x27;ve been using henna and Indigo to color my hair for over 5 years.  I will continue to purchase from this vendor and recommend to others as well.</li>
            <li> Good Seller, but this batch was not as good as last one, did not get the expected color, even though it said crop from 2012. I normally buy 1000 gm package, but they did not carry in crop 2012, so I paid more money and bought 500 gm package. Over all the product was good, but not very much.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as per instruction twice with zero results. It was a waste of time and money. I used henna to cover my grey hairs and used indigo to darken the henna colour. I still had the same henna color after using this product. I waited for my hair to darken after a few days and still nothing. I will stick with just henna from now on. The seller refused to return my money for this absolutely useless product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Indigo Powder for a few months along with the Zenia Henna powder and and love it</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of a natural hair product.&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say the scent of it gave me a headache, next time I&#x27;ll use a few drops of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;I do hope that takes care of that.&lt;br /&gt;Liked the color and the way it made my hair feel.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks ?</li>
            <li> I use it frequently after a Henna deep conditioning, or mixed with 1/3 of Henna to get a nice deep brown color.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that just a rinse out won&#x27;t do, it&#x27;s essential to shampoo well afterwards to remove all of the Indigo debris.  And also to moisturize well, else hair gets too dry from it.</li>
            <li> Use  15 to 20 minutes after you wash out Henna. It takes about two hours to turn your hair a dark black anything less than two hours your hair will be a dark brown. Add a pinch of salt to make sure the indigo clings to the henna. This indigo powder really gives good coverage for gray hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now never had any complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this indigo powder at the beginning of the year. Until now I had no idea of its true quality because the henna that I mixed with it had a very low dye content. Yesterday I finally did a two-step dye job with a better quality henna and this indigo powder. The result is a gorgeous black  color that covers my grey beautifully. I am going to buy a new supply soon ![[ASIN:B004EMJ9EI 500g Pure Indigoferra Tinctoria Indigo Powder]]</li>

            <li> I started coloring my hair with henna and indigo again because it&#x27;s healthier. I&#x27;d never used indigo before so I went online and researched how to mix it. You don&#x27;t need to wait after you mix the indigo. It&#x27;s ready to use. If you are using henna, you need to mix it the night before and let it stay overnight. The next day just before you are ready to start, mix the indigo and then mix the indigo into the henna. Adding different proportions of henna to indigo will determine your color. The more indigo you mix in, the darker the color will be and less red. The indigo has a nice powdery substance and mixes well with water. It stays green and it doesn&#x27;t change its color.

            <li> it is not the 100 % pure indigoferra tinctoria  indigo powder.&lt;br /&gt;tested it and does not give the true  blue indigo color,  which i did get from the indigo powder, that i use to purchase from my local retailer.</li>
            <li> I color my hair with a blend of indigo and henna.  Pure henna makes your hair orange, while indigo mmakes it pure black.  A blend of the two gives me a lovely, rich deep auburn.  I get many compliments on my hair.  Over the years as I got more and more gray, I had to use more indigo. Now that I&#x27;m nearly all white, I use a 50/50 mix.  Zenia is a fine quality indigo.</li>
            <li> The only plant-based dye to actually cover gray hair.  I apply the Indigo twice followed by Henna.  I wish I could use the Indigo alone, but I don&#x27;t want navy blue hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this 500g bag of Indigo lasted 10 months.  Incredible!</li>
            <li> I was using a different brand of indigo for years until the price kept increasing. Glad I found this on Amazon. Not only is the price reasonable, the quality is better...goes on smoother &amp; the results give me better coverage and a richer color.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a very timely manner.  Product was in excellent condition. Product was double bagged and sealed. Outer bag was the foil, that is very sturdy. Has used twice, and is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. After years of applying  chemical color to my hair I wanted to try some thing natural. So I tried  Zenia Indigo color after doing lot of research. I did as I was given instructions. I first wet my hair and applied henna and after 2 hours washed it and then applied Zenia Indigo powder to get the black tone.  I kept the Indigo for one hour. . I got the result that I desired.  It is messy a little bit, but it is worth it.  I strongly recommend this Indigo if any one wants black color for their hair to cover their grey color. . No more chemicals on my hair any more. I am happy I found some thing natural. I bought 500 gms packet from Amazon.com. It comes for 6 months if you apply monthly and taken enough amount every time you use not wasting taking larger amounts.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it with henna as a hair dye. I highly recommend this product to anyone with a sensitivity to commercial hair dyes.</li>
            <li> This Indigo is very good, it worked perfectly. I use this product after henna. The result is a dark brown hair color that covers my grey nicely.</li>
            <li> Beautiful dye release in just a few minutes. Very fine powder that makes for a very smooth and silky mix. Henna is great stuff for your hair but if you don&#x27;t like orange/red hair you need to mix in indigo.</li>
            <li> This Indigo is very good, it worked perfectly. Nice dye release, very finely sifted.  It comes in a convenient big package eliminating the need to open different bags to reach an ideal wight. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I used this to add to the Mehendi 9 Herb Henna to tone down the red-orange color.  I love it!  It is very creamy and the quality is excellent!  I hope amazon never stops selling this! Some buyers complain about the smell...this is what henna smells like!</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to PPD in hair dye and other products.  My allergy started as a itchy scalp, caused chemical burns to my scalp, swollen areas of my face, itchy skin and burning areas that went down to my toes due to shampooing my hair in the shower.  I ended up getting 2 prescriptions and a shot from my Dr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using multiple brands of hair dyes, I had given up on covering my gray until I used this product after a henna treatment.  I am happy with the results and will continue to use this product after the henna treatment.  It is messy and takes more time than packaged hair rinses or dyes but the results last longer and don&#x27;t irritate my scalp like the commercial hair dyes and rinses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of videos on line that are very helpful in researching this process and may help you determine if this process will work for you.</li>
            <li> This indigo came exactly as advertised.  It arrived quite promptly and was well packaged. I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of Zenia Indigo Powder and I&#x27;m not sure if I received a bad batch or not. I followed the instructions as stated on the packaging and the mixed product did not turn a dark purple-ish/black after 15 minutes of curing. The first bag I bought was no problem, every batch I prepared cured within 15 to 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grays were not completely covered after doing the two-step process (henna first, then indigo). This wasn&#x27;t the problem with the first bag I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the drawing board for a different brand of Indigo Henna. Will not be purchasing this brand again.</li>
            <li> I am experimenting with this.  First off, when you mix it with water and a little salt and let it sit, it is supposed to turn black/blue after about 15 minutes.  THAT NEVER HAPPENS WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!  I watched a youtube video of someone who demostrates an organic indigo powder mixing and it turns completely black.  I have now tried to mix this twice and let it sit for around 15-30 minutes and on both occassions it stays a stubborn red.  This means that this is a bogus product - its not indigo at all.  Looks like they may have sold indigo in 2011 (good reviews in 2011) but seem to have substituted henna for indigo and selling it as indigo.  Ths first time I tried this I mixed it with Henna which produced zero results.  I used Nupur brand henna and got a gorgeous deep red on my grays but no sign of black from this indigo powder.  As I write this I have another test mixture in a porcelein bowl sitting next to me, its been mixed and sitting for about 15 minutes now and no sign of black or blue, only a lovely bottle green.  Jeez!  How do people even sell this?</li>
