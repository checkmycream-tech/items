            <li>A total win, win situation to me.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Good product, worth the money, takes out frizz and most curl but not all.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended the Keratin shampoo and conditioner to extend the life of my Keratin blowout treatment and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li>We love both the shampoo and conditioner that Keratin makes.&lt;br /&gt;Great Purchase you can make</li>
            <li>The best conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy when I received a different item</li>
            <li>Great for long hair!!!</li>
            <li>I returned it quickly.  </li>
            <li>Amazon reimbursed me quickly.</li>
            <li>The salon sells this exact shampoo for more than twice as much.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that I use on my own hair and have my daughter hooked on it too.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, they included a new pump, but that broke right away too.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly/wavy but not in a pretty way, so she suggested I try the Keratin products.  </li>
            <li>What I found was that the shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel as soft and managable as it was in my youth, it holds curl better when I wish to curl it and it straighten easier and stays straight longer when I wish it to be straight.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fast and always include a pump for the large bottle.  </li>
            <li>Comes well packaged with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I ran out of the conditioner I purchased from the salon and was a little nervous about being able to find a quality product online that worked as well.  </li>
            <li>Makes the hair soft and truly untangles very well.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine, but I was very upset with having to deal with the mess.</li>
            <li>but it appears to have the exact same ingredients as Coppola</li>
            <li>and you want awesomely soft hair again, use it.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Make your hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>I use this with the shampoo to extend the life of my keratin treatment, its worth every penny spent, will never use anything else</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li>I opened it and sure enough, the cap was broken and there was conditioner EVERYWHERE.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.  Keeps my hair healthy and shiny.  If you have keratin, you need this conditioner.  A bottle lasts about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have the Keratin Straightening Treatment done regularly and my stylist uses this product line - so it is what is recommended for maintenance. It works great and the prices on Amazon are the best around!</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner but when i received that package about 1/4 of the product was spilled all over the box. I guess that is a risk you take when you buy on line.</li>
            <li> This product came wrapped up in plastic wrap and the word \\&quot;DAMAGED\\&quot; was written across it in permanent marker. I opened it and sure enough, the cap was broken and there was conditioner EVERYWHERE. Fortunately, they included a new pump, but that broke right away too. I am so disappointed in the way this product was presented to me. The product itself is fine, but I was very upset with having to deal with the mess. I&#x27;m just hoping it was some fluke accident, but who knows...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  My stylist, Sarah, introduced me to this product.  My hair is curly/wavy but not in a pretty way, so she suggested I try the Keratin products.  My hair looks healthy and shiny and best of all straight.  I call it my \\&quot;hair crack\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> As one ages our hair tends to age and dry along with the rest of us. I stumbled upon the Keratin Complex Shampoo and Conditioner when I had my hair straightened and continued to use it long after the straightening had ceased.  What I found was that the shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel as soft and managable as it was in my youth, it holds curl better when I wish to curl it and it straighten easier and stays straight longer when I wish it to be straight.  A total win, win situation to me.  So ladies if you are, ummm over,  ummm 50 and you want awesomely soft hair again, use it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fast and always include a pump for the large bottle.  I will continue to shop and buy their products.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> nice product and seller</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thick and wavy.  I have color on my hair so it tangles a lot after washing.  I use Keratin Color Shampoo and then follow with this Conditioner.  These products work great.  They straighten, detangle and protect my highlights.</li>
            <li> I recently had a Keratin smoothing treatment done on my very thick curly hair.  I ran out of the conditioner I purchased from the salon and was a little nervous about being able to find a quality product online that worked as well.  I love this conditioner! My hair is so soft and manageable i&#x27;m thrilled with this product.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again and again.  It was also 1/2 the cost of the salon brand.</li>
            <li> The product was NOT as advertised. I returned it quickly.  Amazon reimbursed me quickly. Read the comments and never purchase from this seller.  I found out after reading the comments I was not the only person who got scammed.</li>
            <li> Good product, worth the money, takes out frizz and most curl but not all. This is my proffered keratin treatment</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I have wavy, frizzy hair, and this makes my hair so much more manageable! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I get the Keratin treatments for my hair every 3 months.  The salon sells this exact shampoo for more than twice as much.  Comes well packaged with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner &amp; will continue to buy it.  My stylist recommended it after I got my hair keratin straightened.  Just use a little though</li>
            <li> Great on my hair. Make your hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Although I do not get the Keratin treatment anymore, I still use this Conditioner, it is the best for getting rid of tangles.  I even use it as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is great for all types of hair! Great for long hair!!! Used at salons too!</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended the Keratin shampoo and conditioner to extend the life of my Keratin blowout treatment and I&#x27;m glad she did. The shine and smoothness lasted longer than if I had used a different product. These have no sulfates so great for colored hair also.</li>
            <li> I use this with the shampoo to extend the life of my keratin treatment, its worth every penny spent, will never use anything else</li>
            <li> The best conditioner for dry hair. We love both the shampoo and conditioner that Keratin makes.&lt;br /&gt;Great Purchase you can make</li>
            <li> The product description and picture make it seem like you are buying the Coppola brand-- THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU RECEIVE. Do not spend your money on this company-- its counterfeit.</li>
            <li> excellent for my hair, i love it!</li>
            <li> As expected and prompt delivery</li>
            <li> The prodct description/picture state that I&#x27;m buying the Coppola brand..BUT THIS ISN&#x27;T WHAT I RECEIVD. I compard ingredients in the Coppola brand &amp; this nonCoppola brand &amp; they&#x27;re different! I also compared prices on other websites and this nonCoppola brand is usually less expensive than the Coppola brand. Please do not advertise that this is the Coppola brand because it is not! Change the ad picture!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years....ever since I started getting Keratin Smoothing Treatments.  Makes the hair soft and truly untangles very well.</li>
            <li> Seems to help my color last longer and keeps my keratin treatment working. Tried other conditioner and it stripped Keratin out.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I use on my own hair and have my daughter hooked on it too.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and this product didn&#x27;t help at all, feels very thin and watery, doesn&#x27;t seem to do any more than a $4 conditioner would.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy when I received a different item but it appears to have the exact same ingredients as Coppola so I decided to keep it.  The product is good but I think they need to change the picture however.</li>
            <li> Works excellent for my hair... Helps restore the keratin in your hair! I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great conditioner</li>
