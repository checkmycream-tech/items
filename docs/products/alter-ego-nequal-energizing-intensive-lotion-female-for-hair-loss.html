            <li>Since the application, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has been shedding a LOT more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nequal Energizing Intensive Lotion for 3days now, I haven&#x27;t seen any major results as I just started, but surprisingly it has a really nice smell, and i have noticed the mid front of my hair getting a bit full.</li>
            <li>This product make feel really fresh sensation in the scalp&lt;br /&gt;smell</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKS, REALLY DO WHAT IS SOPOUSE TO DO, BUT MAKE SURE YOU PUT IT ON YOUR SCALP, NOT ON YOUR HAIR,</li>
            <li>It feels incredible strong on the scalp (like putting alcohol) and half of one ampoule covers the entire scalp</li>

            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say that it works or not.</li>
            <li>This product DOES work and I am glad I can pay much less on Amazon.</li>
            <li>(I live in the Bahamas).</li>
            <li>My hair grows really fast but it didn&#x27;t matter since I was loosing so much hair, which leave me always having groups of hair of different length growing all the time.  </li>
            <li>Last week, we applied the first application of the root stimulator, and my hair started tangling and shedding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 23 years old</li>
            <li>Now, i went natural and it helps with the growth and strengh of my hair.</li>
            <li>I even cried with how much hair I lost last week as I just started growing my hair back.</li>
            <li>After the first ampoule I was loosing HALF of what it normally fell and by the end of the treatment I was only loosing a dime size of hair</li>
            <li>Apparently I went to an allergist and found out</li>
            <li>I get my hair professionally done on a weekly basis, and my stylist does the same thing each visit:  </li>
            <li>After only 3 applications, I am still loosing some hair, BUT I can say it is the normal amount that a person looses on a daily basis nothing like I used to before this treatment.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe nobody had write a review for this anti-hair loss treatment.  The Alter EGO Curativ Ego Cren have more reviews and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Intensive Lotion.  I&#x27;m 23 years old and I&#x27;ve been loosing a LOT of hair since I was 16.  My hair grows really fast but it didn&#x27;t matter since I was loosing so much hair, which leave me always having groups of hair of different length growing all the time.  I went to a salon one day and the hair stylist thought somebody gave me a bad haircut, so embarrasing -_-.      After the first ampoule I was loosing HALF of what it normally fell and by the end of the treatment I was only loosing a dime size of hair and I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I recommend it to my friend that was going through chemotherapy (in pills) and it worked just as well as me.  It feels incredible strong on the scalp (like putting alcohol) and half of one ampoule covers the entire scalp but I still use it all.  The only thing is that after two months I started loosing hair just like before and that&#x27;s when I decided to try The Alter Ego Curativ Ego Cren but it didn&#x27;t do even half of the Intensive Lotion.  I&#x27;m gonna order it again and I don&#x27;t mind using it for the rest of my life if it will give me beautiful healthy hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ironic this product is for hair loss yet it created another problem for me... allergic reaction. My scalp had a severe itching attack. Apparently I went to an allergist and found out I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance in any hair products so this did not work for me...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any different in my hair growth. I like the smell though. My hubby thew away both bottles with the dispense on them, so I stopped using it after 2 weeks. I guess I can try again to see what type of results i could get using it consistently. I still have a whole box. I will have to put in a spray bottle in order to apply it directly on my scalp, otherwise it is way to difficult due to the shape of the bottle to apply it directly from the bottle.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to Alter Ego a couple of years ago...it stopped my hair loss and helped regrow the area. Excellent results!  Ever since then, I have used and recommended this and other Alter Ego products to family and friends. All of the Alter Ego products that we&#x27;ve tried are great...they keep their word!</li>
            <li> It softens my hair stops breakage and has helped to get hair back where It was thinning.  Very good product</li>
            <li> Thir product really works, I used it before when I had a perm in my hair.  Now, i went natural and it helps with the growth and strengh of my hair.</li>
            <li> awesome product. have been using this for a long time.  I love the texture of my color. i get so many compliments on how shiny my hair is. definitely will reorder.</li>
            <li> This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product. thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
            <li> My mother in law recommend it, I like and it did a good job restoring my hair. I give  a 4 star cause I think they are better products than this one, but this isn&#x27;t bad overal.</li>
            <li> Works well and strengthens hair.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product consistently. It makes my hair more shinny, grow, thicker and the folic of my hair stronger. I am so glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li> DELIVERY WAS FAST. GOOD PRODUCT FOR HAIR LOSS! I TOLD MY CO-WORKER ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND SHE PURCHASED A BOX. VERY EXPENSIVE IN THE BEAUTY STORE AS THEY SELL INDIVIDUAL SO YOU&#x27;LL SAVE MORE MONEY BUYING A BOX HERE!</li>
            <li> I was loosing a LOT of hair due to stress. It was a nightmare to wash my hair because I had a bunch of my hair in my hands just rinsing my hair, even without conditioner. Also, every morning I woke up with a trail of hairs all over my pillow and sheets. It was awful!!!...I looked online for a product that could help me before going bald. I read the reviews about this product and I gave it a try. I also bought the shampoo. After only 3 applications, I am still loosing some hair, BUT I can say it is the normal amount that a person looses on a daily basis nothing like I used to before this treatment. In addition, I had some trouble with my package and the customer services was amazing and very helpful!  I will continue buying this product! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nequal Energizing Intensive Lotion for 3days now, I haven&#x27;t seen any major results as I just started, but surprisingly it has a really nice smell, and i have noticed the mid front of my hair getting a bit full. I use it twice a day morning and night. My hair appears to be healthier and a bit bouncy. I can&#x27;t say much more, at this point but I will be back in about a months time. Oh and It took only 5 days to get here (I live in the Bahamas).</li>
            <li> This product does what it says! I&#x27;m losing less hair every time, my hair is stronger. I like the smell a lot. A must have for hair loss.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Alto Ego products and they can be expensive buying them through a hair salon or beauty supply. This product DOES work and I am glad I can pay much less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you are a committed person you should try this product.Because if you have breakage or thin hair and you want to see result  use it as directed for at least 6 months.You will be suprised.If you want fast result may this will not be the right product for you.</li>
            <li> The best product when you hair is folling</li>
            <li> I am truly disappointed with this product. Interestingly, I used to use this product faithfully about 5 years ago, and it did wonders for my hair during that time. Unfortunately, this time around it was absolutely awful!! It made my hair tangle so badly. Additionally, it made my hair feel brittle! I get my hair professionally done on a weekly basis, and my stylist does the same thing each visit:  wash, condition and set with rollers. Last week, we applied the first application of the root stimulator, and my hair started tangling and shedding. My stylist even made comments that something about this product didn&#x27;t work well this time around. Since the application, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has been shedding a LOT more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair appointment for this week is tomorrow. We will not use these drops this time to see if my hair reacts as it usually does before the first application. I must add that I am a faithful user of the alter ego garlic treatment, which leaves my hair shiny and full of body. However, this root stimulator took that away last week. I even cried with how much hair I lost last week as I just started growing my hair back. I must add that in the past I would feel a slight tingle with each application. I did not feel any tingle this time around. I don&#x27;t know if the quality of this product has declined over the years. However, I want my money back and the manufacturer can have the remaining applications. I will not use this again! Good luck to other ladies who choose to use this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it made a difference in the experience I was performing so I can&#x27;t really say that it works or not.</li>
            <li> Gifted it to a friend and she said it totally worked...</li>
            <li> This product make feel really fresh sensation in the scalp&lt;br /&gt;smell good and is not only a few drops is plenty of product&lt;br /&gt;even for long hair like I have&lt;br /&gt;for sure I will buy more ALTER EGO products</li>
            <li> This realy help to reduce hair loss and for me. I saw the results after the third use and I will continue using it till my hair loss stops . I recommend it to everyone with hair loss</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKS, REALLY DO WHAT IS SOPOUSE TO DO, BUT MAKE SURE YOU PUT IT ON YOUR SCALP, NOT ON YOUR HAIR, BEACUSE IT WILL BRAKE YOUR HAIR AND TANGLE IT. IS ADVISABLE TO STYLE YOU HAIR AFTER FEW MINUTE OF  PUTTING THIS PRODUCT ON YOUR SCALP, TO AVOID SPREADING THE PRODUCT ON YOUR HAIR.</li>
