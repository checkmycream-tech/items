            <li>These things are THE BEST invention.</li>
            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>These work great in a pinch!  </li>
            <li>but once I figured it out they were great.  </li>
            <li>These are great.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Really easy and great product!</li>
            <li>These strips removed the hair well, were easy to use, and were shaped perfectly BUt they pulled all of my eyelid skin off under my brows and it hurts!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great results.  </li>
            <li>I always get compliments on how nice my brows are.  </li>
            <li>Glad it worked on some people, but not me.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to see them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Since these are already perfectly shaped, it&#x27;s so fast to get it done right.</li>
            <li>I love these brow shapers, they are really easy to use.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pick up the really fine eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>Great for travel and saves you $25 for a brow wax before you really need professional shaping.</li>
            <li>trick is to make sure the skin is clean - and to rub your finger over the strip until you can feel it really grab hold to your skin.  </li>
            <li>It has really strong wax on it that almost always pull the hair out, first try.</li>
            <li>this makes it really easy and fast.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t understand how anyone could not get this to work for them!?!</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give these one star is because the shape WAS easy enough to TRACE it onto the (MUCH more effective)</li>
            <li>The best part is that they are a cool wax strips so you don&#x27;t have to heat them up or worry about slipping hot wax anywhere, just take the clear backing off and they are ready to use.</li>
            <li>I cleaned the area with alcohol, held my face taut, and pulled in the right direction.</li>
            <li>I tried these last night for the first time and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>exactly so I sort of bent them a bit as I applied them.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really get a good feel for what size you need, much less trim the strips to size when they are packaged in that way.</li>
            <li>kind of agree to the other user, its just like a scatch tape</li>
            <li>These are very easy to use, the pre-cut shape makes for quick brow shaping, and I never have to go over the same spot more than twice (usually just once).</li>
            <li>And most of the time, they don&#x27;t pick up the really long course ones</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I used to pluck my eyebrows, but this is a much easy and longer lasting option.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them a few years now, love them!</li>
            <li>They work really well.</li>
            <li>The only trick is to make sure your skin and eyebrow hair is clean, dry, and you pull in the correct direction.</li>
            <li>suppose for reasonably fine-haired people they MIGHT work.</li>
            <li>The process was easy and less painful than a salon and the results were perfect.</li>
            <li>These are OK if you have pretty neatly groomed brows and just need to get a few stray hairs but for an actual brow groom</li>
            <li>My threading lady moved to a new store and they wont tell me where she went.  </li>
            <li>my local beauty supply store stopped selling them which is crazy, so the 4 pack is perfect!</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money or time buying this product!</li>
            <li>I had tried another brand (which worked pretty well) and thought all brands would basically work the same, but these don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I did wipe the area with alcohol first and the outcome was still the same.  </li>
            <li>I was too lazy to trim the strips to fit my brows</li>
            <li>I usually do not have to pluck any, but occasionally there is a stray I didn&#x27;t get under a strip</li>
            <li>into 2.&lt;br /&gt;i will say that you should wipe down the area you&#x27;re waxing with alcohol to remove any oil first.</li>
            <li>Took the hair off as long as I actually pulled it off quickly and did not leave any stickiness on the skin like other wax.  </li>
            <li>They are much gentler and only caused minimal redness on my skin.</li>
            <li>I rubbed the strips pretty firmly after I positioned them.</li>

            <li> I rubbed the strips pretty firmly after I positioned them.</li>
            <li> I needed an alternative to waxing due to sensitive, acne prone skin that needed peroxide-based cleansers.</li>
            <li> It does leave me with a little redness, so I usually do these right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> It would be much cheaper if you just use a few rolls of scotch tape!!</li>
            <li> These handy little strips make eyebrow maintenance much less tedious.</li>
            <li> course, it WAS easier to tweeze those select hairs afterwards as they were now gluey and rigid and stuck straight</li>
            <li> ordered these for my daughter who is over seas.&lt;br /&gt;She couldn&#x27;t get them other</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other product.  </li>
            <li> They do not take off the hair in one use, in fact I had to use 5 strips on one brow the other day.  </li>
            <li> but I love their cold bikini wax!</li>
            <li> I bought some surgi brazilian wax a few days ago but found it to be way to messy to try and use on my eyebrows especially since I had never waxed at home before.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they didn&#x27;t press hard enough when applying the strips?</li>
            <li> I would return them, but it&#x27;s not worth the hassle and return postage.</li>
            <li> After a few tries, you get the hang of shaping your brows, and you&#x27;ll never need to leave the house for waxing ever again.</li>
            <li> There was a little redness afterwards (less than at the salon though).</li>
            <li> They were a little tricky for me to place</li>
            <li> Until I find her - this is my last resort secret weapon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But my brows are as black, course, and thick as Lebanese brows go.</li>
            <li> I have thick, black eyebrow hairs and these</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t leave a single unwanted hair behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to threading my eyebrows, so I don&#x27;t usually go in for the eyebrow wax.</li>
            <li> I usually wax with nads or sally hansen wax strips but have to cut them out myself, so I decided to give these a try.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty much worthless.</li>
            <li> (At least with Con-tac paper I could&#x27;ve lined my kitchen drawers afterward).</li>
            <li> I have really thick eyebrows, so it&#x27;s a pain in the ass keeping them neat with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time with these things, they are confusing and worthless.</li>
            <li> It is also much less painful.</li>
            <li> (I had it on the wrong side of my eyebrow)</li>
            <li> It keeps my crazy brows in check</li>
            <li> instructions recommend you put the strips up to your brow beforehand and cut the strips to size, which is impossible to do because they put 20 of them edge to edge on one piece of paper.  </li>
            <li> I got these thinking that I wouldn&#x27;t have to go get my brows waxed anymore since I had a bad experience at school with some wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores anymore</li>
            <li> I guess its a crap shoot.</li>
            <li> this is a terrible product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> this product just doesn&#x27;t work. kind of agree to the other user, its just like a scatch tape</li>
            <li> I have really thick eyebrows, so it&#x27;s a pain in the ass keeping them neat with tweezers. this makes it really easy and fast. i do pluck 3 or 4 stubborn hairs, but that&#x27;s it. turns 20 min. into 2.&lt;br /&gt;i will say that you should wipe down the area you&#x27;re waxing with alcohol to remove any oil first. i have oily skin, so this makes a BIG difference in its affectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using these for years now. i keep a constant supply.</li>
            <li> ordered these for my daughter who is over seas.&lt;br /&gt;She couldn&#x27;t get them other wise.&lt;br /&gt;She uses them all the time</li>
            <li> The only hair removal product I will ever use!</li>
            <li> I bought some surgi brazilian wax a few days ago but found it to be way to messy to try and use on my eyebrows especially since I had never waxed at home before.  I went back to ULTA today and bought these to try when I got home.  They were a little tricky for me to place (I had it on the wrong side of my eyebrow) but once I figured it out they were great.  Took the hair off as long as I actually pulled it off quickly and did not leave any stickiness on the skin like other wax.  Really easy and great product!</li>
            <li> These things are THE BEST invention. my local beauty supply store stopped selling them which is crazy, so the 4 pack is perfect!</li>
            <li> This was literally like using scotch tape. It takes no hair off..</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter and myself. Do not waste your time with these things, they are confusing and worthless.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money or time buying this product! It would be much cheaper if you just use a few rolls of scotch tape!! You&#x27;d get the same results!!!</li>
            <li> My threading lady moved to a new store and they wont tell me where she went.  Until I find her - this is my last resort secret weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to make sure the skin is clean - and to rub your finger over the strip until you can feel it really grab hold to your skin.  It keeps my crazy brows in check and I keep them in stock in my medicine cabinet - just in case.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I will never use anything else.  Easy to use and great results.  Just take your time and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> These handy little strips make eyebrow maintenance much less tedious. I&#x27;ve been using them for years. They work really well.</li>
            <li> Been using these for use to keep my eyebrows in check.  I always get compliments on how nice my brows are.  Won&#x27;t use any other product.  I have super sensitive skin and they never make me break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to threading my eyebrows, so I don&#x27;t usually go in for the eyebrow wax. This product is amazing! It takes 10 seconds to get shaped brows and get rid of the excess hair!</li>
            <li> The only trick is to make sure your skin and eyebrow hair is clean, dry, and you pull in the correct direction. I really can&#x27;t understand how anyone could not get this to work for them!?! Since these are already perfectly shaped, it&#x27;s so fast to get it done right. It does leave me with a little redness, so I usually do these right before I go to bed. No sign of redness by morning. I usually do not have to pluck any, but occasionally there is a stray I didn&#x27;t get under a strip that I&#x27;ll just pluck- user error there. I&#x27;ve been using them a few years now, love them!</li>
            <li> I got these thinking that I wouldn&#x27;t have to go get my brows waxed anymore since I had a bad experience at school with some wax. These are OK if you have pretty neatly groomed brows and just need to get a few stray hairs but for an actual brow groom these don&#x27;t work at all. It is like putting scotch tape on there and ripping it off.</li>
            <li> These are pretty much worthless. I had tried another brand (which worked pretty well) and thought all brands would basically work the same, but these don&#x27;t work.  They don&#x27;t pick up the really fine eyebrow hairs. And most of the time, they don&#x27;t pick up the really long course ones either.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend you put the strips up to your brow beforehand and cut the strips to size, which is impossible to do because they put 20 of them edge to edge on one piece of paper.  You can&#x27;t really get a good feel for what size you need, much less trim the strips to size when they are packaged in that way. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in this purchase. I would return them, but it&#x27;s not worth the hassle and return postage.</li>
            <li> These strips removed the hair well, were easy to use, and were shaped perfectly BUt they pulled all of my eyelid skin off under my brows and it hurts! i hope i dont have scabs there tomorrow.  if i dont then these are great--if i do then NO thank you</li>
            <li> The reviewer who stated this is like scotch tape was correct.  I usually wax with nads or sally hansen wax strips but have to cut them out myself, so I decided to give these a try.  They do not take off the hair in one use, in fact I had to use 5 strips on one brow the other day.  I still have to use tweezers for some hairs.  Would not buy again.  I did wipe the area with alcohol first and the outcome was still the same.  Is there even wax on these things?  They are about as sticky as scotch tape.  I do not have hard to remove hairs, they come out just fine with other products.  I cleaned the area with alcohol, held my face taut, and pulled in the right direction. Glad it worked on some people, but not me.  I guess its a crap shoot.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my eyebrows. I use this to help shape my eyebrows. I trim with scissors and eyebrow razors but use this for my overall shaping. It has really strong wax on it that almost always pull the hair out, first try. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> have to use like 20 on one brow and all it does is rip your skin off</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give these one star is because the shape WAS easy enough to TRACE it onto the (MUCH more effective) Sally Hansen rectangular wax strips I had been using. I tried with washed skin, unwashed skin, rubbing alcohol, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Of course, it WAS easier to tweeze those select hairs afterwards as they were now gluey and rigid and stuck straight out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose for reasonably fine-haired people they MIGHT work. But my brows are as black, course, and thick as Lebanese brows go. This was like trying to wax my face with Con-tac paper (At least with Con-tac paper I could&#x27;ve lined my kitchen drawers afterward).</li>
            <li> should have requested my money back  they wouldnt lift hair off a baby let alone eyebrows this is a terrible product</li>
            <li> I love these brow shapers, they are really easy to use. I used to pluck my eyebrows, but this is a much easy and longer lasting option. I was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores anymore so I was glad to see them on Amazon. The best part is that they are a cool wax strips so you don&#x27;t have to heat them up or worry about slipping hot wax anywhere, just take the clear backing off and they are ready to use. I like that they are not just a rectangle but a shaped to help you sculpt your upper and lower brow.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brow strips for years but only one store in my area carries them. I went in and they were sold out so I chose to use a different brand and they were nothing like these ones! These are very easy to use, the pre-cut shape makes for quick brow shaping, and I never have to go over the same spot more than twice (usually just once).</li>
            <li> These work great in a pinch!  Great for travel and saves you $25 for a brow wax before you really need professional shaping.</li>
            <li> I tried these last night for the first time and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results. I found these at Sally Beauty Supply for $4.50. The package contains enough strips to do your brows 14X. The process was easy and less painful than a salon and the results were perfect. I have thick, black eyebrow hairs and these didn&#x27;t leave a single unwanted hair behind. I was too lazy to trim the strips to fit my brows exactly so I sort of bent them a bit as I applied them. It took a total of 2 minutes to do each brow. There was a little redness afterwards (less than at the salon though). I don&#x27;t understand how some reviewers couldn&#x27;t get the product to work properly. Maybe they didn&#x27;t press hard enough when applying the strips? I rubbed the strips pretty firmly after I positioned them.</li>
            <li> After a few tries, you get the hang of shaping your brows, and you&#x27;ll never need to leave the house for waxing ever again. It is also much less painful. I needed an alternative to waxing due to sensitive, acne prone skin that needed peroxide-based cleansers. I found it in this product. They are much gentler and only caused minimal redness on my skin.</li>
            <li> Does the job for brows and chin; I keep this in stock always.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work at all. Maybe my face is too oily but I love their cold bikini wax!</li>
