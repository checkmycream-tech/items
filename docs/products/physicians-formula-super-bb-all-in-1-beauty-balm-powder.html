    <ol>
            <li>Plus this powder has great coverage!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!!  </li>
            <li>The Light/Medium color blends perfectly with my fair skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need foundation after applying this powder has great coverage</li>
            <li>This powder works great for me as a foundation.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still looking for a good powder I can wear.</li>
            <li>This BB powder product is a good one.</li>
            <li>Does a really good job of covering imperfections.</li>
            <li>was still good</li>
            <li>I loved about the Beauty Balm Powder</li>
            <li>and I figured since this was for &amp;#34;Light/Medium&amp;#34; skin color that it would be good, but</li>
            <li>Wish it came with a makeup sponge as opposed to a brush, but still very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This BB powder is really good in that it gives you a nice dewey finish</li>
            <li>I will say buy the Kabuki brush and use that instead of the brush that comes with it - huge difference in comfort and coverage!!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>I thought it would work nicely during the winter months.</li>
            <li>It has some warm tints that don&#x27;t work with my coloring.  </li>
            <li>I begrudgingly opened up the PF powders again and was really surprised at how great they made my skin look with-out the hair!!!</li>
            <li>Light weight, easy to touch-up through out the day, great coverage - I became a PF fan.</li>
            <li>Love the luminous tan like color on my face.</li>
            <li>Love the price and thats in an All in ONE product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Coverage is even better than the PF I was using, definitely evens tone, helps with pores, and feels great!!</li>
            <li>If I can find it in a better hue for me, I&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>It was time for me to buy more, but with the cost, I was hesitant.  </li>
            <li>$12.00 was much better than $50.00 for the burning Jane Iredale.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please pack your items better and check all returned items to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone else.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok for days</li>
            <li>I finally have found the perfect powder make up and</li>
            <li>I now use a powder puff to apply the powder as this is more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>any case, I&#x27;m still looking for a better powder.</li>
            <li>I also discovered it is really great for using it over my liquid foundation since the face looks more natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a great fan of Physician&#x27;s Formula and Almay products as they never have affected my very sensitive allergic prone</li>
            <li>After 7 years, I&#x27;m still exploring mineral foundations, but I think I like the original physicians formulas better than the BB cream.</li>
            <li>: I LOVE this powder as the powder feels light and comfortable.</li>
            <li>but i love it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and covers well.</li>
            <li>It came with a color correcting powder, a light skinned powder, a concealer, and a highlighter.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing I apply before I leave the house, this and some physician&#x27;s formula happy booster blush</li>
            <li>I contacted the manufacture and this is gluten free.  </li>
            <li>, I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the enclosed brush as I prefer my own better made personal make-up brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li>I wear light/medium and it just blends right in just like it specifically blended for me!</li>
            <li>the powder just sat on top and made the fuzz really noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have both Caucasian and Asian blood, so my skin is light but also kind of lightly tanned</li>
            <li>It provides good, slightly luminous coverage and lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li>that claim not to contain any of the ingredients that users of other mineral powder brands have experienced problems with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When super BBC all in one arrived at my house</li>
            <li>(Available at Target, Amazon, Wal-Mart)...will buy the BB again - I&#x27;m an ivory or light in most other make-ups and the light/medium is a great look with a little bit of color like I have a light tan...</li>
            <li>color of the powder matched my light to medium skin coloration very well.</li>
            <li>and the coverage is good although not full.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to lessen the hair after working with my Dr. and then my regular make-up ran out.</li>
            <li>Light weight and natural feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the texture, coverage and with the shade, though it&#x27;s a little bit light for my summer tan.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need or want to wear foundation, just have some powder on hand to even out skin tone and reduce shine when I&#x27;m going to be leaving the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am ready for the day.</li>
            <li>My daughter bought me Clinique liquid cover-up (which I really like), but I think the BB powder is better overall, especially in summer because it doesn&#x27;t smear, run, or drip and it&#x27;s easy to reapply through out the day without a major make-up redo.</li>
            <li>I do love the coverage and ease of this BB powder, but it makes me look super pale!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a powder foundation to alternate on the days I don&#x27;t want to use my full coverage liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll see how it does in the winter when I&#x27;m super white!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what is in these hypoallegenic powders, particularly those (like Mary Kay)</li>
            <li>bought the Physician&#x27;s Formula Super BB All-In-One Beauty Balm Powder for under $20 at our local discount department store.</li>
            <li>First makeup that didn&#x27;t break my skin out or feel super heavy.  Looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I still see some pink tones from my mild ros√°cea</li>
            <li>but I put the kit away a few days after I got it because I found with the fine peach fuzz all over my face</li>
            <li>The coverage is complete, but doesn&#x27;t make me look &amp;</li>
            <li>;  It&#x27;s quite natural, and is a breeze to apply.</li>
            <li>It goes on just as smooth and covers just as well, if not better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals and Mary Kay mineral powder, and physicians formula compares closey with them in quality.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it might have been my mistake at cutting the package open, however, the bubble wrap on top of it</li>
            <li>Wild make-up because I can&#x27;t stomach the expense of products that regularly fall flat of their claims...</li>
            <li>Barely any powder left in the case.</li>
            <li>It can go on a little thick if you aren&#x27;t careful, so make sure you blend!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two compacts and both contained brushes that have sharp handle edges.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too much trouble for one single item</li>

            <li> Not my everyday makeup,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad, because I&#x27;d found a kit with all 3 BB products for $20 at my local Wal-Mart and, after researching Physicians Formula products all week</li>
            <li> I have been using Jane Iredale for the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Useless brush included.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the luminous tan like color on my face. I use the lt/medium coverage. It goes on smoothly and covers well. Love the price and thats in an All in ONE product. Dont stop selling this one or change. Love it.</li>
            <li> Not my everyday makeup, but i love it for special occasions. Makes my skin look like it glows</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used dollar store  or Wet n Wild make-up because I can&#x27;t stomach the expense of products that regularly fall flat of their claims...last year I stepped it up when I purchased the PF kit on sale. It came with a color correcting powder, a light skinned powder, a concealer, and a highlighter. I&#x27;ve always used the cream to powder type cover-up but I put the kit away a few days after I got it because I found with the fine peach fuzz all over my face the powder just sat on top and made the fuzz really noticeable. However, I was able to lessen the hair after working with my Dr. and then my regular make-up ran out. I begrudgingly opened up the PF powders again and was really surprised at how great they made my skin look with-out the hair!!! Light weight, easy to touch-up through out the day, great coverage - I became a PF fan. Then I saw the BB powder and was intrigued by the SPF and wrinkle help...a little more expensive than what I like to pay at $14 (Wal-Mart), but I gave in and bought it....AMAZING!!  Coverage is even better than the PF I was using, definitely evens tone, helps with pores, and feels great!! It can go on a little thick if you aren&#x27;t careful, so make sure you blend! My daughter bought me Clinique liquid cover-up (which I really like), but I think the BB powder is better overall, especially in summer because it doesn&#x27;t smear, run, or drip and it&#x27;s easy to reapply through out the day without a major make-up redo. I will say buy the Kabuki brush and use that instead of the brush that comes with it - huge difference in comfort and coverage!! (Available at Target, Amazon, Wal-Mart)...will buy the BB again - I&#x27;m an ivory or light in most other make-ups and the light/medium is a great look with a little bit of color like I have a light tan...we&#x27;ll see how it does in the winter when I&#x27;m super white!! They might need to come out with a light/ivory tone too!!</li>
            <li> I really like this color, but it seems a little &amp;#34;Cakey&amp;#34; on me, especially if I reapply (which I usually do). After 7 years, I&#x27;m still exploring mineral foundations, but I think I like the original physicians formulas better than the BB cream.

            <li> You don&#x27;t need foundation after applying this powder has great coverage</li>
            <li> Add this to the growing list of powders I can&#x27;t use. I&#x27;ve been a Mary Kay consultant for the past 10 years, and, thanks to their recent discontinuation of the ONLY loose powder I could wear, I&#x27;ve been on a search for a replacement. MK has switched all of their products to the \\&quot;mineral\\&quot; trend, and now has no \\&quot;regular\\&quot; items. I can&#x27;t use mineral powder products. Not MK, not Bare Escenetuals, and even though this Physicians Formula BB powder does not specify that it is \\&quot;mineral\\&quot;, there&#x27;s still something in it that makes my skin stink and itch as soon as it is applied, just like the other products.

This BB powder product is a good one. I was pleased with the texture, coverage and with the shade, though it&#x27;s a little bit light for my summer tan. I thought it would work nicely during the winter months.</li>
            <li> It has some warm tints that don&#x27;t work with my coloring.  If I can find it in a better hue for me, I&#x27;ll love it.  The coverage is complete, but doesn&#x27;t make me look &amp;#34;made up.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s quite natural, and is a breeze to apply.</li>
            <li> Too much pink in the light/medium. Face looked redder after application. Color totally off for my skin tone.  Enhanced my pores. Don&#x27;t like the packaging. Useless brush included.</li>
            <li> This powder works great for me as a foundation.  I have oily skin and this does not make my skin oilier.  It provides good, slightly luminous coverage and lasts most of the day.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Does a really good job of covering imperfections. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I apply before I leave the house, this and some physician&#x27;s formula happy booster blush and I am ready for the day. Dont need nothing else.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jane Iredale for the past 10 years.  It was time for me to buy more, but with the cost, I was hesitant.  I took my current compact to the store and matched this shade to my Jane Iredale.  It goes on just as smooth and covers just as well, if not better.  Recently, my Jane Iredale even began burning a bit as soon as I put it on.  There was absolutely no burn or irritation with this product.  $12.00 was much better than $50.00 for the burning Jane Iredale.  I love this!  I will buy an extra in case they discontinue it.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Light weight and natural feeling.  I have Celiac&#x27;s disease.  I contacted the manufacture and this is gluten free.  First makeup that didn&#x27;t break my skin out or feel super heavy.  Looks very natural.  A+</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to receive this product. However, it seems as if I got one of the &amp;#34;returned&amp;#34; items!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing that set off an alarm was the ripped cover. At first I thought it might have been my mistake at cutting the package open, however, the bubble wrap on top of it was still good so I knew it wasn&#x27;t my bad cutting that damaged the item. When I opened the item, I had discovered that the brush that came with the item already has some powder on it. As if someone once used it, if ever so slightly. I thought of returning but it&#x27;s too much trouble for one single item so I just threw it away. I&#x27;m disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please pack your items better and check all returned items to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone else. Sharing make up is dangerous!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a powder foundation to alternate on the days I don&#x27;t want to use my full coverage liquid foundation.  This BB powder is really good in that it gives you a nice dewey finish and the coverage is good although not full. I still see some pink tones from my mild ros√°cea but it&#x27;s ok for days I want to look more casual. I also discovered it is really great for using it over my liquid foundation since the face looks more natural.</li>
            <li> When super BBC all in one arrived at my house I opened the box and the powder was all over all my other items . Barely any powder left in the case. Very disappointed .</li>
            <li> All the benefits of a BB cream in a powder! Plus this powder has great coverage! I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> could use darker color</li>
            <li> I finally have found the perfect powder make up and the fact that it&#x27;s considered a Beauty Balm is just gravy!  I wear light/medium and it just blends right in just like it specifically blended for me!</li>
            <li> UPDATE June 27, 2015: I LOVE this powder as the powder feels light and comfortable. The Light/Medium color blends perfectly with my fair skin. The one thing I wish Physicians Formula would do is improve the applicator brush. I&#x27;ve bought two compacts and both contained brushes that have sharp handle edges. I now use a powder puff to apply the powder as this is more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Physician&#x27;s Formula Super BB All-In-One Beauty Balm Powder for under $20 at our local discount department store. I&#x27;m a great fan of Physician&#x27;s Formula and Almay products as they never have affected my very sensitive allergic prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I loved about the Beauty Balm Powder was the inclusion of SPF 30. The SPF adds a layer of sun protection thereby protecting your skin from unwanted UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of the powder matched my light to medium skin coloration very well. You can&#x27;t tell that I am wearing this powder while adding a bit of mysterious zing to brighten up my maturing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application was as there is an enclosed brush. I didn&#x27;t use the enclosed brush as I prefer my own better made personal make-up brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> Covers well.  Wish it came with a makeup sponge as opposed to a brush, but still very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at a Duane Reed, but it&#x27;s the same product. I do love the coverage and ease of this BB powder, but it makes me look super pale! I have both Caucasian and Asian blood, so my skin is light but also kind of lightly tanned and I figured since this was for &amp;#34;Light/Medium&amp;#34; skin color that it would be good, but nope it made me look like a ghost or a really pale Asian girl.&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I&#x27;m still looking for a better powder.</li>
