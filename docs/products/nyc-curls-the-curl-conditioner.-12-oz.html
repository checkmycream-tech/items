    <ol>
            <li>Of all the NYC Curls products, I like this one best.  </li>
            <li>and this product is really wonderful.  </li>
            <li>If my curls are happy, I am happy!  </li>
            <li>The product itself is great.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend using Tigi Curls Rock after showering as a gel, but you should be warned the price for having great looking curly hair obtained from it</li>
            <li>Carlos is a master of curls and has created a great line.</li>
            <li>Really happy with it.</li>
            <li>and I feel great.  </li>
            <li>NYC curls conditioner is FANTASTIC!!!  </li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>I have been using Deva One Conditioner for years but the curl conditioner is a much better product and smells great!</li>
            <li>A really good product.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using NYC Curls none of that, hair feels and looks good</li>
            <li>Gets my hair clean and conditioned perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of this product and my hair does, too!  </li>
            <li>I love and use ALL the NYC Curls products!</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair feel amazing.</li>
            <li>Liked it but will not buy again.</li>
            <li>I really liked all three products in the range (cleanser, conditioner and styling gel).</li>
            <li>Product is okay for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I would restructure the product for better usage.</li>
            <li>love this &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But they could get a better bottle that squeezes.</li>
            <li>love it.......</li>
            <li>I love his conditioner.  </li>
            <li>is a more feminine scent that is stronger than most gels.</li>
            <li>Guy or girl, buy this for better, smoother curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction which I do to many.</li>
            <li>I love that this line has a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Also no curl definition even when leaving in most of the conditioner and using the gel as recommended.</li>
            <li>I filled it the rest of the way up with water and shook it which made it much more liquid and easier to get out.  </li>
            <li>It makes me hair noticeably more curly, and extremely smooth after showering with it.</li>
            <li>What I like best is this: if you use a healthy amount, you can use much less gel/finishing product after.  </li>
            <li>I ordered all 3 products in the line hoping that it would work on my very fine, super frizzy but corkscrew curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The products seem to moisturize nicely, but the frizz is out of control - like really out of control!</li>
            <li>Only a week ago I was ready to shave my head; nw, I&#x27;ve got great, healthy, big ol&#x27; curls with great definition and no frizz!</li>
            <li>My hair is frizz free after using the NYC curls products.  </li>
            <li>I am glad all his years of  &#x60;trial and error&#x27; with other products has paid off and allowed him to create these great products.</li>
            <li>You can get them delivered here from his own website but the delivery charges are v high (not his fault).</li>
            <li>Please consider changing the container to a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; squeeze friendly product.</li>
            <li>I also like that it has good essential oils in it like rosemary and melissa which helps prevent breakage.</li>
            <li>Great product, exactly as described and came quicker than expected as well</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking and feeling healthy and silky and my curls natural, bouncy and well formed.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the no lather part of the shampoo and was surprised on how well it cleans my hair after just one wash.</li>
            <li>As a general tip though: most conditioners will increase curls, so always use one if you seek to improve yours.</li>
            <li>As a cowash it is a little more moisturizing than most.  </li>
            <li>Also great for African American hair.</li>
            <li>And both the shampoo and conditioner smell very yummy!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone out there that wants moisturized curls!  </li>
            <li>product really works!  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Carlos!</li>
            <li>The texture likely does not go into a pump dispenser easily.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry curly hair that hates most products</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I actually get my haircut from Carlos and his products are as fantastic as him.</li>
            <li>I had very frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>So much so, since nothing worked, I had given up.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Have tried so many other products, and none do justice to this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I will never trust new hair or beauty products from Amazon again!</li>
            <li>I really like how my hair turns out: shiny, soft, with less frizz as well as more manageable.</li>
            <li>And I really think it beats Deva&#x27;s One Condition-- you need so, so much of that to get the same effect.</li>
            <li>Most hairdressers do it wet and totally mis-judge things.</li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s a very natural smell</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Ii have followed the directions exactly and have done the deep condition too that is found on NYC Curls.com.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty pricey, but I thought it was well worth the money after I used it for a few days.</li>
            <li>It does carry a faint touch of feminine scent, but it smells more fresh than feminine and I have no problem with the smell, considering the rarity of a masculine one.</li>
            <li>wow wow</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and then work through a little more after I towel dry my hair.</li>
            <li>The consistency is just too light for my hair :/</li>
            <li>the amount that comes out of the bottle is very controlled and thin at a time, so I enjoy signing my name on my hand with this conditioner in the shower before applying it</li>
            <li>This stuff will amplify that effect even further, and it definitely does not retain the smell after a shower, which is something as a guy I value highly.</li>
            <li>I use it with it the shampoo, and though I&#x27;m not a true curly but an erratic wavy, I get maximum curl,  at least fluid wave depending on atmospheric moisture, and my hair looks and feels good.</li>

            <li> I wet my hair and use it daily.</li>
            <li> , I am not sure I will ever buy it again UNLESS the company says &#x27;new improved bottle&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Also, it has lasted a long time because I only have to use a little each day.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle in a bottle conditioner when used with the other two products, shampoo and gel.  </li>
            <li> There are other tips on this products website that I followed.</li>
            <li> He is also one of the few to cut curls when they are dry.</li>
            <li> The frustration of getting the product out of the bottle is definitely not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick coarse wavy hair</li>
            <li> No more dry frizzy curls - now they glisten.  </li>
            <li> I switched to NYC Curls a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> It is SO hard to use however</li>
            <li> The smell was so unpleasant I will never get the entire product used</li>
            <li> Not a good way to start each morning.  </li>
            <li> I would give 10 stars except for the bottle which is VERY hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Very thick which I like, but very hard to get out of the bottle have to take the lid off.  </li>
            <li> However, the plastic container is so hard, that it is VERY difficult to get the product out of it&#x27;s container.</li>
            <li> the difference in my curls now with NYC Curls, vs before with another expensive curly salon product:</li>
            <li> I have used the NYC Curls products for a few days and am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This made my hair and skin feel oily and disgusting!</li>
            <li> Like the hair gel this product smells terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product is okay for my hair.  I would give it a 6 on a scale of 1-10.  The frustration of getting the product out of the bottle is definitely not worth it.  Not a good way to start each morning.  I would restructure the product for better usage.</li>
            <li> I have been using Deva One Conditioner for years but the curl conditioner is a much better product and smells great!</li>
            <li> love this &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;. Seems to hold curl together for that bouncy look!</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, you should buy this product - immediately.  Also great for African American hair. Everyone should have this on hand.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way. I use it in the shower and then work through a little more after I towel dry my hair. It leaves my hair looking and feeling healthy and silky and my curls natural, bouncy and well formed.</li>
            <li> I would give 10 stars except for the bottle which is VERY hard to use.  After 1/3 was gone I filled it the rest of the way up with water and shook it which made it much more liquid and easier to get out.  As a cowash it is a little more moisturizing than most.  It has a heavenly scent.  It is creamier.  It is SO hard to use however, I am not sure I will ever buy it again UNLESS the company says &#x27;new improved bottle&#x27;.  The texture likely does not go into a pump dispenser easily.  But they could get a better bottle that squeezes.</li>
            <li> This made my hair and skin feel oily and disgusting! It also makes me itch! I will never trust new hair or beauty products from Amazon again!</li>
            <li> A really good product. The trick us to leave some in your hair when you rinse and then use the gel.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. I have shoulder length 3a hair and I leave about a tablespoon of it in my hair after rinsing some of it out. I also leave it on for about 20 minutes before rinsing it out. It&#x27;s moisturizing and helps to prevent frizz. I also like that it has good essential oils in it like rosemary and melissa which helps prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this product and my hair does, too!  What I like best is this: if you use a healthy amount, you can use much less gel/finishing product after.  Leaving almost all of it in is like deep conditioning without the weight.  Curls have no frizz but stay bouncy and aren&#x27;t weighed-down.  Of all the NYC Curls products, I like this one best.  And I really think it beats Deva&#x27;s One Condition-- you need so, so much of that to get the same effect.</li>
            <li> love it.......Carlos knows curly hair like no one else</li>
            <li> I love his conditioner.  I actually get my haircut from Carlos and his products are as fantastic as him.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair feel amazing. It was pretty pricey, but I thought it was well worth the money after I used it for a few days. Also, it has lasted a long time because I only have to use a little each day.</li>
            <li> Very thick which I like, but very hard to get out of the bottle have to take the lid off.  Liked it but will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I also wish I had a before and after pic! I have really thick coarse wavy hair and I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month. I only have to shampoo my hair 2x a week with this product. I really like how my hair turns out: shiny, soft, with less frizz as well as more manageable. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the no lather part of the shampoo and was surprised on how well it cleans my hair after just one wash. And both the shampoo and conditioner smell very yummy!</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described and came quicker than expected as well</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone out there that wants moisturized curls!  My hair is frizz free after using the NYC curls products.  Leave a bit of the conditioner in after your shower.</li>
            <li> I had very frizzy hair.  So much so, since nothing worked, I had given up.  When I saw this I found this though I thought I would give it a try.  I have short B3 hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product really works!  Ii have followed the directions exactly and have done the deep condition too that is found on NYC Curls.com.  i actually have defined curls now.  My self esteem is even up.  This is a miracle in a bottle conditioner when used with the other two products, shampoo and gel.  There are other tips on this products website that I followed.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great. However, the plastic container is so hard, that it is VERY difficult to get the product out of it&#x27;s container. Please consider changing the container to a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; squeeze friendly product.</li>
            <li> Disappears as soon as I put it in my hair. The consistency is just too light for my hair :/</li>
            <li> I am a guy that has wavy to curly hair, depending on the length and hair products I use. It is extremely difficult to find stuff to amplify curls for guys that doesn&#x27;t have a total feminine scent, and is one of the reasons I love this product. It does carry a faint touch of feminine scent, but it smells more fresh than feminine and I have no problem with the smell, considering the rarity of a masculine one. It makes me hair noticeably more curly, and extremely smooth after showering with it. It says you can leave it in as a standalone hair product without washing it out, but it feels like a conditioner and so if you can put conditioner in your hair without worrying about it smearing everywhere it touches, go for it. But I have yet to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to guys and girls alike, who want their curls amplified. I would also recommend using Tigi Curls Rock after showering as a gel, but you should be warned the price for having great looking curly hair obtained from it is a more feminine scent that is stronger than most gels. As a general tip though: most conditioners will increase curls, so always use one if you seek to improve yours. This stuff will amplify that effect even further, and it definitely does not retain the smell after a shower, which is something as a guy I value highly. Guy or girl, buy this for better, smoother curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. the amount that comes out of the bottle is very controlled and thin at a time, so I enjoy signing my name on my hand with this conditioner in the shower before applying it haha XD try it! It&#x27;s the only time you can do it!</li>
            <li> Like the hair gel this product smells terrible. The smell was so unpleasant I will never get the entire product used</li>
            <li> NYC curls conditioner is FANTASTIC!!!  I have very dry curly hair that hates most products and this product is really wonderful.  My hair feels silky and moisturized and is shiney too!!  Carlos is a master of curls and has created a great line.</li>
            <li> I really liked all three products in the range (cleanser, conditioner and styling gel). Carlos comes to London 3-4 times a year to cut my hair. I trust him as he has had curls himself. He is also one of the few to cut curls when they are dry. Most hairdressers do it wet and totally mis-judge things. I am glad all his years of  &#x60;trial and error&#x27; with other products has paid off and allowed him to create these great products. I had a friend visit NY so I had them delivered to the hotel as its not possible to get them delivered to London (at the moment via Amazon) but hopefully that will change soon. You can get them delivered here from his own website but the delivery charges are v high (not his fault).</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it with it the shampoo, and though I&#x27;m not a true curly but an erratic wavy, I get maximum curl,  at least fluid wave depending on atmospheric moisture, and my hair looks and feels good. It has a scent which sometimes I can still catch a hint of hours after my shower but I like it-it&#x27;s a very natural smell and I don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction which I do to many. Really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love and use ALL the NYC Curls products!</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I switched to NYC Curls a few months ago.  Since then people come up to me to comment on my curls.  No more dry frizzy curls - now they glisten.  If my curls are happy, I am happy!  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love that this line has a shampoo and conditioner. Gets my hair clean and conditioned perfectly. Have tried so many other products, and none do justice to this conditioner. Highly recommend to anyone with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered all 3 products in the line hoping that it would work on my very fine, super frizzy but corkscrew curly hair.  I have used the NYC Curls products for a few days and am very disappointed.  The products seem to moisturize nicely, but the frizz is out of control - like really out of control! Also no curl definition even when leaving in most of the conditioner and using the gel as recommended. I am returning all 3 products for a refund.  Back to DevaCurl and DevaCare I go...</li>
            <li> Finally! NYC Curls as arrived! I should have taken a before/after photo....the difference in my curls now with NYC Curls, vs before with another expensive curly salon product: wow wow wow. Only a week ago I was ready to shave my head; nw, I&#x27;ve got great, healthy, big ol&#x27; curls with great definition and no frizz! I had two people stop me to ask what I used--it&#x27;s that obvious!  Thanks, Carlos!</li>
            <li> Used to use DevaCurl and found it made my hair greasy.  Also made me sweat.  Since I have been using NYC Curls none of that, hair feels and looks good and I feel great.  I wet my hair and use it daily.</li>
