            <li>The drafting of this design, and its execution, are the best I have seen in ANY faux-stone tiara.  </li>
            <li>The two \\&quot;end pieces\\&quot; of the band are wonderfully flexible, so that this tiara CAN, if desired, be put on anyone of any age, from 9 - 109!  </li>
            <li>This worked perfectly for that.  </li>
            <li>I contacted customer service and they were absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is made beautifully!</li>

            <li>i was very happy with my purchase and my fiance LOVED it, but for what it retailed for</li>
            <li>beautiful tiara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert on how genuine-stone tiaras are made, but I do know, that the beautiful tiara owned by Queen Elizabeth II, officially called \\&quot;The Girls of Great Britain and Ireland\\&quot; tiara, (because they were the ones who gave the money for it&#x27;s construction), but which has also been called, \\&quot;The Fairy Queen</li>
            <li>The tiara is beautiful and shines very nice on.</li>
            <li>A great purchase.</li>
            <li>thing of beauty is a joy forever\\&quot; said John Keats.  </li>
            <li>To which I add, \\&quot;A well-constructed thing of beauty is a joy forever, and a marvel to behold!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but she was happy, so that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product &amp; the service.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice tiara.  </li>
            <li>very beautiful and elegant.  </li>
            <li>Would also be good for a wedding or halloween costume.  </li>
            <li>and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>It sparkles with a gorgeous brilliance.</li>
            <li>but my man kept waking me up for the good parts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get a good quality product</li>
            <li>and I am sure she will look beautiful in it.</li>
            <li>The crown is light and dainty.  </li>
            <li>The detail is very nice and it looks about 5x better in person.</li>
            <li>and I are really happy with how this looks, and I am excited to wear it at my wedding!</li>
            <li>In the end, things do not get much better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted and goes with my dress perfectly.</li>
            <li>This was so pretty and looked great on my head!  </li>
            <li>However, this should definitely NOT stop you from buying this totally BEAUTIFUL and EXCELLENTLY DESIGNED TIARA.  </li>
            <li>The detail and shape of this tiara is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>and yes, they are identical, (the one I own, and the one bieng sold here.)  </li>
            <li>A beautiful piece for my niece&#x27;s sweet sixteen, a day she will always remember.</li>
            <li>She loved it and looks so lovely with it.  </li>
            <li>and thus I&#x27;d  consider it nice costume jewelry.</li>
            <li>It looks like what it is, though -- a totally beautiful tiara, carefully and exquisitely designed.  </li>
            <li>It sparkles beautifully and is definitly worth the price.</li>
            <li>It was very comfortable  and fit great.  </li>
            <li>I never saw the product, but it shipped quickly, arrived in great shape, and on the day promised.</li>
            <li>They looked great and are very pretty.</li>
            <li>It looks great with a two tier veil and it sparkles so much!  </li>
            <li>The end combs fit nicely into the hair,(even thinning hair), and do NOT fab the skull.  </li>
            <li>Now I just have to order ones or myself.:-)</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a solid tiara for just about any occasion this is an excellent choice for the money.</li>
            <li>The requirement was for her to be able to dance with it for a while, then pull it off, so it couldn&#x27;t be pinned.  </li>
            <li>This tiara was more than I hoped for.</li>
            <li>watched the royal wedding together so also meaningful in that way.</li>
            <li>My GF got so many compliments on her</li>
            <li>It sits on the head more like a halo than a head band.  </li>
            <li>i guess i was expecting more substance to it.</li>
            <li>I saw how many goo reviews this product recived and decided to get it.  </li>
            <li>it is even better looking in person than on line....</li>
            <li>The bend-ability of the crown is what I like most about it.</li>
            <li>I received a lot of compliments on it and some of my favorite pictures ever taken were with this tiara on my head.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and got many compliments.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to bend it back into shape, then this may be a good buy for you, but for 50 bucks for a tiara, I expect it to be perfect because there are ones that cost $20 that are way better in quality and material.</li>
            <li>It sure will make you feel like a true princess!</li>
            <li>Thanks for Everything, tiara, earrings, necklace all very nice, although I can not really use but are very stylish accessories, and I am very excited about the purchase was a good choice</li>
            <li>The beauty of the tiara is self-evident, upon looking at the picture -- but believe me, it is even MORE beautiful when you can actually take it up in your ands.  </li>
            <li>My niece absolutely loved this, now she can be a real princess.</li>
            <li>it was JUST RIGHT!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this tiara for my daughter as a surprise for her to wear during her Sweet 16 party!</li>
            <li>Astonishingly, and wonderfully, this \\&quot;faux-stone\\&quot; tiara ALSO has a small rim of stones at the bottom, making the tiara taller, and more easily seen.    </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this tiara.</li>
            <li>It is demure, sweet looking, lovely.  </li>
            <li>Not only was it beautiful on stage, but it fit so well and stayed in place.  </li>
            <li>It is not very sturdy, but it looks beautiful and received many compliments.</li>
            <li>It is easy to bend to shape your head and the combs fit comfortably.  </li>
            <li>And i had one very happy little girl.</li>
            <li>I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas and it was a huge hit.</li>
            <li>If I had wanted a cheap tiara I would have gone somewhere like Michael&#x27;s and paid $15.</li>
            <li>Fit</li>
            <li>It can be shaped to fit and work with any hairstyle.</li>
            <li>My wife was surprised and thrilled at the quality and received many complements and was queried as to where she found it.</li>
            <li>This tiara is very nice, especially for the price-</li>
            <li>I am wearing tiara and long veil - they looked great</li>
            <li>am so excited to wear this bling bling</li>
            <li>and I am finding myself wearing it around the house because I am so excited about it.    </li>
            <li>Nearly two years later, the tiara is still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Beautiful tiara design with plenty of sparkle, but not overdone to the point of looking cheap or childish.</li>
            <li>Although we have not yet used the tiara it is for my daughers&#x27;s sweet sixteen, she likes it</li>
            <li>I bought this tiara for my sweet sixteen.</li>
            <li>i bought it for my niece&#x27;s sweet 16</li>
            <li>It sat on the Queen&#x27;s ehad, but it&#x27;s full beauty was often not seen, because the bottom of the tiara was lost amongst Her Majesty&#x27;s thick and beautiful hair!  </li>
            <li>The tiara was just as pictured, and was sent quickly &amp; well packed.  </li>
            <li>but it was very pretty nontheless.  </li>
            <li>It fit beautifully and stayed on without pins, on thick, curly, full head of hair.</li>
            <li>It is pretty, nice, and comes off as classy.</li>
            <li>It appears very delicate, but it&#x27;s well made and fits her head perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something different from the cheap tiaras you can buy at the store, and I sure got exactly what I wanted with this tiara.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a bold, large crown this is not it.  </li>
            <li>I actually ended up buying three of these tiaras after the first gift recipient liked hers so much.</li>
            <li>It was obviously made very cheaply and the rhinestones fell out as well.</li>
            <li>In actuality, it is more actually approaching 6/10 or 7/10!     </li>
            <li>The product was almost exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Just as described - very sparkly!</li>
            <li>I appreciate their hard work and wonderful customer service, I will recommend them to anyone and will definitely use them again!!</li>
            <li>Material was very cheap and shoddy and easily bent.</li>
            <li>The piece is not too heavy but not so light that it falls off easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s classy and chic and so pretty!</li>
            <li>thank you for offering such a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>After much searching I decided to purchase this item from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>&quot; that really shines.  </li>
            <li>Maybe real diamond tiaras are created this way --</li>
            <li>(Don&#x27;t bend the end pieces too much, though.  </li>
            <li>Because, however well they are soldered on, (and they are VERY well soldered on)</li>
            <li>Much better than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>A real bargain.</li>
            <li>It is so very sparkly and everyone is quite taken with the beauty of it and of her.  </li>
            <li>, everything expected a gift for my precious granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>so it is not that high (or large) of a crown.  </li>
            <li>This allows the \\&quot;center band\\&quot; section of the part with the stones to be shown to full and stunning effect -- not attached to any band, (in the center, that is), the bottom rim of stones can shine as brightly  as any other part of the tiara, totally unhindered by any \\&quot;backing\\&quot; of a band!  </li>
            <li>The tiara arrived in a small box and with it&#x27;s own bag to store it in.  </li>
            <li>You can get a tiara for less or a lot more-</li>
            <li>-- once was NOT as high as it is today.  </li>
            <li>The highest part of the crown (the front) is about 1.5 inches high</li>
            <li>a little more bling.</li>
            <li>The tiara is reasonably priced, not cheaply made, has much sparkle, and is comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>I bought the first for one 40 year old woman and two for two 60 year old gal pals for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of buying a few more for my nieces.  </li>
            <li>wore it to a black-tie new year&#x27;s eve event and it was the highlight of the party....</li>
            <li>I put it on and looked in my bathroom mirror and just WOW!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>However, it is nice, doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as less expensive tiaras I have tried on, and very sparkly, which is all I really wanted.</li>
            <li>The actual \\&quot;lower bend\\&quot; of the tiara is HIGHER, creating a far deeper \\&quot;chord\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>So far my hairdresser, my parents,</li>
            <li>I am hoping the hairdresser will be able to hide because I have thick hair.</li>
            <li>subtle and elegant...</li>
            <li>Nope - THIS tiara has the band CUT IN TWO, and sturdily soldered to each side of the main, central part of the tiara, (where the stones are.)  </li>
            <li>It was flexible enough that I was able to conform it to her head, which is small</li>
            <li>As to the construction, it is like NO other \\&quot;faux jewel\\&quot; tiara I have ever seen!  </li>
            <li>I ordered them on line and, as we live overseas,  I have not physically seen them myself but did see videos of my daughter and friends wearing them.</li>
            <li>I read that it was a custom/ tradition for a mother to present her daughter with a tiara for her 16th birthday to symbolize transitioning from a young girl to a young lady.</li>
            <li>I had ordered the tiara back in early July and it was supposed to arrive on July 17th.</li>
            <li>If you look VERY closely at this tiara, and at the one that Kate Middleton, (now The Princess Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge), is wearing, you will see that they are NOT exact duplicates.  </li>
            <li>It will last a long time under normal use.  </li>

            <li> I LOVE it and got many compliments.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to bend it back into shape, then this may be a good buy for you, but for 50 bucks for a tiara, I expect it to be perfect because there are ones that cost $20 that are way better in quality and material.</li>
            <li> It sure will make you feel like a true princess!</li>
            <li> Thanks for Everything, tiara, earrings, necklace all very nice, although I can not really use but are very stylish accessories, and I am very excited about the purchase was a good choice</li>
            <li> The beauty of the tiara is self-evident, upon looking at the picture -- but believe me, it is even MORE beautiful when you can actually take it up in your ands.  </li>
            <li> My niece absolutely loved this, now she can be a real princess.</li>
            <li> it was JUST RIGHT!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this tiara for my daughter as a surprise for her to wear during her Sweet 16 party!</li>
            <li> Astonishingly, and wonderfully, this \\&quot;faux-stone\\&quot; tiara ALSO has a small rim of stones at the bottom, making the tiara taller, and more easily seen.    </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this tiara.</li>
            <li> It is demure, sweet looking, lovely.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it beautiful on stage, but it fit so well and stayed in place.  </li>
            <li> It is not very sturdy, but it looks beautiful and received many compliments.</li>
            <li> It is easy to bend to shape your head and the combs fit comfortably.  </li>
            <li> And i had one very happy little girl.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas and it was a huge hit.</li>
            <li> If I had wanted a cheap tiara I would have gone somewhere like Michael&#x27;s and paid $15.</li>
            <li> Fit</li>
            <li> It can be shaped to fit and work with any hairstyle.</li>
            <li> My wife was surprised and thrilled at the quality and received many complements and was queried as to where she found it.</li>
            <li> This tiara is very nice, especially for the price-</li>
            <li> I am wearing tiara and long veil - they looked great</li>
            <li> am so excited to wear this bling bling</li>
            <li> and I am finding myself wearing it around the house because I am so excited about it.    </li>
            <li> Nearly two years later, the tiara is still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Beautiful tiara design with plenty of sparkle, but not overdone to the point of looking cheap or childish.</li>
            <li> Although we have not yet used the tiara it is for my daughers&#x27;s sweet sixteen, she likes it</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for my sweet sixteen.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my niece&#x27;s sweet 16</li>
            <li> It sat on the Queen&#x27;s ehad, but it&#x27;s full beauty was often not seen, because the bottom of the tiara was lost amongst Her Majesty&#x27;s thick and beautiful hair!  </li>
            <li> The tiara was just as pictured, and was sent quickly &amp; well packed.  </li>
            <li> but it was very pretty nontheless.  </li>
            <li> It fit beautifully and stayed on without pins, on thick, curly, full head of hair.</li>
            <li> It is pretty, nice, and comes off as classy.</li>
            <li> It appears very delicate, but it&#x27;s well made and fits her head perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something different from the cheap tiaras you can buy at the store, and I sure got exactly what I wanted with this tiara.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a bold, large crown this is not it.  </li>
            <li> I actually ended up buying three of these tiaras after the first gift recipient liked hers so much.</li>
            <li> It was obviously made very cheaply and the rhinestones fell out as well.</li>
            <li> In actuality, it is more actually approaching 6/10 or 7/10!     </li>
            <li> The product was almost exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just as described - very sparkly!</li>
            <li> I appreciate their hard work and wonderful customer service, I will recommend them to anyone and will definitely use them again!!</li>
            <li> Material was very cheap and shoddy and easily bent.</li>
            <li> The piece is not too heavy but not so light that it falls off easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s classy and chic and so pretty!</li>
            <li> thank you for offering such a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> After much searching I decided to purchase this item from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> &quot; that really shines.  </li>
            <li> Maybe real diamond tiaras are created this way --</li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t bend the end pieces too much, though.  </li>
            <li> Because, however well they are soldered on, (and they are VERY well soldered on)</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> A real bargain.</li>
            <li> It is so very sparkly and everyone is quite taken with the beauty of it and of her.  </li>
            <li> , everything expected a gift for my precious granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> so it is not that high (or large) of a crown.  </li>
            <li> This allows the \\&quot;center band\\&quot; section of the part with the stones to be shown to full and stunning effect -- not attached to any band, (in the center, that is), the bottom rim of stones can shine as brightly  as any other part of the tiara, totally unhindered by any \\&quot;backing\\&quot; of a band!  </li>
            <li> The tiara arrived in a small box and with it&#x27;s own bag to store it in.  </li>
            <li> You can get a tiara for less or a lot more-</li>
            <li> -- once was NOT as high as it is today.  </li>
            <li> The highest part of the crown (the front) is about 1.5 inches high</li>
            <li> a little more bling.</li>
            <li> The tiara is reasonably priced, not cheaply made, has much sparkle, and is comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> I bought the first for one 40 year old woman and two for two 60 year old gal pals for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of buying a few more for my nieces.  </li>
            <li> wore it to a black-tie new year&#x27;s eve event and it was the highlight of the party....</li>
            <li> I put it on and looked in my bathroom mirror and just WOW!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> However, it is nice, doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as less expensive tiaras I have tried on, and very sparkly, which is all I really wanted.</li>
            <li> The actual \\&quot;lower bend\\&quot; of the tiara is HIGHER, creating a far deeper \\&quot;chord\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> So far my hairdresser, my parents,</li>
            <li> I am hoping the hairdresser will be able to hide because I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> subtle and elegant...</li>
            <li> Nope - THIS tiara has the band CUT IN TWO, and sturdily soldered to each side of the main, central part of the tiara, (where the stones are.)  </li>
            <li> It was flexible enough that I was able to conform it to her head, which is small</li>
            <li> As to the construction, it is like NO other \\&quot;faux jewel\\&quot; tiara I have ever seen!  </li>
            <li> I ordered them on line and, as we live overseas,  I have not physically seen them myself but did see videos of my daughter and friends wearing them.</li>
            <li> I read that it was a custom/ tradition for a mother to present her daughter with a tiara for her 16th birthday to symbolize transitioning from a young girl to a young lady.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the tiara back in early July and it was supposed to arrive on July 17th.</li>
            <li> If you look VERY closely at this tiara, and at the one that Kate Middleton, (now The Princess Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge), is wearing, you will see that they are NOT exact duplicates.  </li>
            <li> It will last a long time under normal use.  </li>
            <li> Not only this, but the extreme right and left corners of the band, (AWAY from the center), are slightly and gracefully lowered, then have a tiny rise, from the rest  of the stoned band, giving the tiara an additional uplift when it sits upon your head!    </li>
            <li> I wanted a very classy tiara - no cheap rhinestones or metal and glue jobs.</li>
            <li> It began to crumble and fall apart on my big day as it was being carefully placed on my already done hair.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high for the average crown</li>
            <li> Unhappy with the 3 tiaras I already own, (one too small, one too big, and one with combs that dig into my skull), I boought this tiara elsewhere on the internet.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned it would not fit my big Irish head</li>
            <li> I think the size might be on the small size for an adult head, but I can&#x27;t imagine this will be a problem for anyone.</li>
            <li> Although not shown in the image, the very back angles down into two combs which hold the item in place.</li>
            <li> The jewels are well placed not cheap looking and definitely have that \\&quot;bling\\</li>
            <li> , breakage still can occur, with rough handling.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really \\&quot;Kate Middleton\\&quot;</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiara is very flimsy and poorly made.</li>
            <li> However, THIS tiara does NOT have a band going all the way across the botom, as in other \\&quot;faux\\&quot;-stone tiaras I have seen.  </li>
            <li> Not too big and not to small-</li>
            <li> Not exactly the Cartier Halo</li>
            <li> It is pretty don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> just enough to add a little sparkling touch to go with her dress!!  </li>
            <li> The stones are set together tightly so that you hardly see any of the bars that connect it together in the back of the headpiece.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife for a black tie dinner.  </li>
            <li> A little spendy for a halloween costume, but the quality is there.</li>
            <li> maybe a little heavier.</li>
            <li> it is not cheaply made-</li>
            <li> This is not cheap plastic</li>
            <li> This is so small that I thought that it was for my flower girl and not me.</li>
            <li> After obsessing over the royal wedding, there was no better tiara choice for me.</li>
            <li> It is also very small, and doesn&#x27;t span the head, rather perches on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The picture shows the \\&quot;chord\\&quot; as being approximately one-quarter of a circle.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I have been left, disappointed.</li>
            <li> I may need to find a tricky way to hide it using fake hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not easily impressed</li>
            <li> You just cannot go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Also it shines like crazy.</li>

            <li> Although we have not yet used the tiara it is for my daughers&#x27;s sweet sixteen, she likes it and I am sure she will look beautiful in it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful tiara design with plenty of sparkle, but not overdone to the point of looking cheap or childish. It bends how you want it to. So far my hairdresser, my parents, and I are really happy with how this looks, and I am excited to wear it at my wedding!</li>
            <li> After much searching I decided to purchase this item from Amazon.  The tiara arrived in a small box and with it&#x27;s own bag to store it in.  The piece is not too heavy but not so light that it falls off easily.  The jewels are well placed not cheap looking and definitely have that \\&quot;bling\\&quot; that really shines.  It is easy to bend to shape your head and the combs fit comfortably.  The tiara is reasonably priced, not cheaply made, has much sparkle, and is comfortable to wear.  A great purchase.</li>
            <li> Unhappy with the 3 tiaras I already own, (one too small, one too big, and one with combs that dig into my skull), I boought this tiara elsewhere on the internet.  I checked the picture...and yes, they are identical, (the one I own, and the one bieng sold here.)  When I bought mine, I had no idea that this was actually called the BLING JEWELRY KATE MIDDLETON ROYAL WEDDNG HALO TIARA, as the place from which I bought it did not disclose its name or origin.    If you look VERY closely at this tiara, and at the one that Kate Middleton, (now The Princess Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge), is wearing, you will see that they are NOT exact duplicates.  Similar, yes -- the same, no.  However, this should definitely NOT stop you from buying this totally BEAUTIFUL and EXCELLENTLY DESIGNED TIARA.  Here&#x27;s why....    The beauty of the tiara is self-evident, upon looking at the picture -- but believe me, it is even MORE beautiful when you can actually take it up in your ands.  The actual \\&quot;lower bend\\&quot; of the tiara is HIGHER, creating a far deeper \\&quot;chord\\&quot;.  The picture shows the \\&quot;chord\\&quot; as being approximately one-quarter of a circle.  In actuality, it is more actually approaching 6/10 or 7/10!     As to the construction, it is like NO other \\&quot;faux jewel\\&quot; tiara I have ever seen!  Maybe real diamond tiaras are created this way -- I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ve never seen one up close.  However, THIS tiara does NOT have a band going all the way across the botom, as in other \\&quot;faux\\&quot;-stone tiaras I have seen.  Nope - THIS tiara has the band CUT IN TWO, and sturdily soldered to each side of the main, central part of the tiara, (where the stones are.)  This allows the \\&quot;center band\\&quot; section of the part with the stones to be shown to full and stunning effect -- not attached to any band, (in the center, that is), the bottom rim of stones can shine as brightly  as any other part of the tiara, totally unhindered by any \\&quot;backing\\&quot; of a band!  Not only this, but the extreme right and left corners of the band, (AWAY from the center), are slightly and gracefully lowered, then have a tiny rise, from the rest  of the stoned band, giving the tiara an additional uplift when it sits upon your head!    I&#x27;m no expert on how genuine-stone tiaras are made, but I do know, that the beautiful tiara owned by Queen Elizabeth II, officially called \\&quot;The Girls of Great Britain and Ireland\\&quot; tiara, (because they were the ones who gave the money for it&#x27;s construction), but which has also been called, \\&quot;The Fairy Queen Tiara\\&quot; - and with good reason! -- once was NOT as high as it is today.  It sat on the Queen&#x27;s ehad, but it&#x27;s full beauty was often not seen, because the bottom of the tiara was lost amongst Her Majesty&#x27;s thick and beautiful hair!  So, the Queen had an additional rim put on the bottom of the tiara, so that all of it&#x27;s beauty could be seen by those who met here.  Astonishingly, and wonderfully, this \\&quot;faux-stone\\&quot; tiara ALSO has a small rim of stones at the bottom, making the tiara taller, and more easily seen.    This tiara looks neither like the Queen&#x27;s Fairy-Queen Tiara, nor, (to my eyes anyway), like the Queeen&#x27;s Halo Tiara, which she lent to Kate Middleton for her Wedding to Prince William, and her transformation into The Princess Catherine.  It looks like what it is, though -- a totally beautiful tiara, carefully and exquisitely designed.  The drafting of this design, and its execution, are the best I have seen in ANY faux-stone tiara.  The end combs fit nicely into the hair,(even thinning hair), and do NOT fab the skull.  The two \\&quot;end pieces\\&quot; of the band are wonderfully flexible, so that this tiara CAN, if desired, be put on anyone of any age, from 9 - 109!  (Don&#x27;t bend the end pieces too much, though.  Because, however well they are soldered on, (and they are VERY well soldered on), breakage still can occur, with rough handling.    \\&quot;A thing of beauty is a joy forever\\&quot; said John Keats.  To which I add, \\&quot;A well-constructed thing of beauty is a joy forever, and a marvel to behold!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was looking for a crown type tiara to give to someone who was the &#x27;queen for the day&#x27;.  This worked perfectly for that.  Would also be good for a wedding or halloween costume.  A little spendy for a halloween costume, but the quality is there.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice tiara.  I bought it for my niece&#x27;s 18th birthday (Debut) and she loved it.  It&#x27;s not really \\&quot;Kate Middleton\\&quot; but it was very pretty nontheless.  This is a keeper and if my niece decides she can even use this as \\&quot;something old\\&quot; for her wedding.</li>
            <li> My niece absolutely loved this, now she can be a real princess. I never saw the product, but it shipped quickly, arrived in great shape, and on the day promised. And i had one very happy little girl. In the end, things do not get much better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife for a black tie dinner.  My wife was surprised and thrilled at the quality and received many complements and was queried as to where she found it.Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had ordered the tiara back in early July and it was supposed to arrive on July 17th. After a couple of weeks, it never came. I contacted customer service and they were absolutely wonderful. They immediately shipped another tiara and it arrived shortly thereafter. The tiara is beautiful and will work perfectly for what I need it for. I appreciate their hard work and wonderful customer service, I will recommend them to anyone and will definitely use them again!!</li>
            <li> The product was almost exactly what I hoped for. It is pretty, nice, and comes off as classy. I think the size might be on the small size for an adult head, but I can&#x27;t imagine this will be a problem for anyone. Although not shown in the image, the very back angles down into two combs which hold the item in place.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for my sweet sixteen. It fit beautifully and stayed on without pins, on thick, curly, full head of hair. Also it shines like crazy. It is made beautifully! I would recommend this for any occasion. It&#x27;s lovely!</li>
            <li> A well made tiara with lots of bling!!  My daughter-in-law loved it!  It was part of the theme for her &#x27;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s birthday party!</li>
            <li> very beautiful and elegant.  i bought it for my niece&#x27;s sweet 16 and she loved it.  very happy with this purchase.  thanks!</li>
            <li> I actually ended up buying three of these tiaras after the first gift recipient liked hers so much. I bought the first for one 40 year old woman and two for two 60 year old gal pals for Christmas. I ordered them on line and, as we live overseas,  I have not physically seen them myself but did see videos of my daughter and friends wearing them. They looked great and are very pretty. I bought them to cheer us all up as it had been a difficult year for so many of us. Now I just have to order ones or myself.:-)</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful piece of work. The detail is very nice and it looks about 5x better in person. I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas and it was a huge hit. If you are looking for a solid tiara for just about any occasion this is an excellent choice for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for my daughter to use for a dance.  The requirement was for her to be able to dance with it for a while, then pull it off, so it couldn&#x27;t be pinned.  It was perfect!  Not only was it beautiful on stage, but it fit so well and stayed in place.  It was flexible enough that I was able to conform it to her head, which is small (she is only 10) and it didn&#x27;t hurt her.  The price was great too!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this tiara for my wedding. It began to crumble and fall apart on my big day as it was being carefully placed on my already done hair. It was obviously made very cheaply and the rhinestones fell out as well. If I had wanted a cheap tiara I would have gone somewhere like Michael&#x27;s and paid $15. However I did not expect this to happen to this tiara that I paid about $40 for. Needless to say I have been left, disappointed.</li>
            <li> The tiara feels like someting you would by a dollar store.  Enough said.  I will put it on my dog for Halloween!</li>
            <li> I ordered this tiara for my wedding in Feb 2014. I wanted a very classy tiara - no cheap rhinestones or metal and glue jobs. This tiara was more than I hoped for. I put it on and looked in my bathroom mirror and just WOW! It sparkles with a gorgeous brilliance. I know when they place my song, &amp;#34;Here Comes the Bride&amp;#34; the door will open and it will just be AHHHH WOW! I would definitely recommend this for a bride. I am wearing tiara and long veil - they looked great together.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside may be metal on side that attach to comb. I am hoping the hairdresser will be able to hide because I have thick hair. I may need to find a tricky way to hide it using fake hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to wear this bling bling crown.&lt;br /&gt;We watched the royal wedding together so also meaningful in that way. I fell asleep but my man kept waking me up for the good parts.</li>
            <li> Just as described - very sparkly!</li>
            <li> It arrived timely. A beautiful piece for my niece&#x27;s sweet sixteen, a day she will always remember. It was brilliant.</li>
            <li> Beautiful !  Much better than I expected for the price.  I think the person who will receive this will like it.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely beautiful.  My GF got so many compliments on her birthday.&lt;br /&gt;Then it tarnished within one month and turned yellow.  So buy it for one time use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tiara for my daughter as a surprise for her to wear during her Sweet 16 party! I read that it was a custom/ tradition for a mother to present her daughter with a tiara for her 16th birthday to symbolize transitioning from a young girl to a young lady. This tiara was perfect!!  Not too big and not to small- it was JUST RIGHT!! My daughter is tiny so I did not want something that would take away from her- just enough to add a little sparkling touch to go with her dress!!  This tiara is very nice, especially for the price- it is not cheaply made- when I say it was perfect- it was PERFECT- I am not easily impressed and I toiled over which tiara to buy- I was thrilled with my choice!!  You can get a tiara for less or a lot more- I don&#x27;t think I could have been any happier with a more expensive one.  And hopefully on her wedding day she will wear it again!!</li>
            <li> Great tiara for my princess!</li>
            <li> Received order within 2 days.  I was very happy with the quality for the price.  Fit well.  A real bargain.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to review this inferior product, but the seller has sent me four emails requesting one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiara is very flimsy and poorly made. It is also very small, and doesn&#x27;t span the head, rather perches on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still sitting in the box waiting to be returned. Shame to lose the shipping costs, but I don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> Bought the tiara for my mother&#x27;s 90th bday.  Gave it to her today.  She loved it and looks so lovely with it.  It is so very sparkly and everyone is quite taken with the beauty of it and of her.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for my wedding and I am finding myself wearing it around the house because I am so excited about it.    It looks great with a two tier veil and it sparkles so much!  Not exactly the Cartier Halo but it will definitely add sparkle to my big day!</li>
            <li> While this tiara looks nothing at all like the Kate Middleton Cartier one, that had no influence on my buying it. If this matters to you, don&#x27;t be fooled by the tagline for the tiara. However, it is nice, doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as less expensive tiaras I have tried on, and very sparkly, which is all I really wanted.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Tiara for my wedding. Although the wedding has not happened yet (October 5, 2012 is the date) The tiara is beautiful. It is exactly what I wanted and goes with my dress perfectly.</li>
            <li> Went on line to search for a crown.  Found and decided on this one after reviewing the feedback.  The price is a little high for the average crown but I thougth I&#x27;d get a good quality product and I was not dissappointed.  The crown is light and dainty.  It sits on the head more like a halo than a head band.  The stones are set together tightly so that you hardly see any of the bars that connect it together in the back of the headpiece.  The highest part of the crown (the front) is about 1.5 inches high so it is not that high (or large) of a crown.  It is demure, sweet looking, lovely.  If you are looking for a bold, large crown this is not it.  It is a princess crown, not a queen crown.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Material was very cheap and shoddy and easily bent. Also the crown was not properly centered and looked like it was lopsided. If you&#x27;re willing to bend it back into shape, then this may be a good buy for you, but for 50 bucks for a tiara, I expect it to be perfect because there are ones that cost $20 that are way better in quality and material.</li>
            <li> maybe i am about to show how knowledgeless i am about tiaras. i was very happy with my purchase and my fiance LOVED it, but for what it retailed for i guess i was expecting more substance to it. maybe a little heavier. a little more bling. but she was happy, so that&#x27;s all that matters. i would definitely buy another product from this company if everything they make is as quality as this tiara is.</li>
            <li> The tiara was just as pictured, and was sent quickly &amp; well packed.  I&#x27;m happy with the product &amp; the service.</li>
            <li> The tiara is beautiful and shines very nice on.It is not very sturdy, but it looks beautiful and received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tiara for my daughter.  she will be making her debut in January and as all girls want to be princesses she wanted a tiara.  I saw how many goo reviews this product recived and decided to get it.  I was not dissapointed.  thank you for offering such a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas gift (she&#x27;s 13), and she wouldn&#x27;t take it off for the entire day.  It appears very delicate, but it&#x27;s well made and fits her head perfectly.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying a few more for my nieces.  It&#x27;s a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Thanks for Everything, tiara, earrings, necklace all very nice, although I can not really use but are very stylish accessories, and I am very excited about the purchase was a good choice</li>
            <li> This is not cheap plastic it&#x27;s metal and thus I&#x27;d  consider it nice costume jewelry. It will last a long time under normal use.  From my understanding, this is Amy Farrah Fowler approved!</li>
            <li> item came well packaged....it is even better looking in person than on line....wore it to a black-tie new year&#x27;s eve event and it was the highlight of the party....subtle and elegant...a must have!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for an event where I needed a lot of bling.  This was so pretty and looked great on my head!  It was very comfortable  and fit great.  I was concerned it would not fit my big Irish head but the tiara side bands are flexible and allow for adjustment.  I got a lot of compliments on it.  I wish I could wear it all the time!</li>
            <li> This is so small that I thought that it was for my flower girl and not me. It is pretty don&#x27;t get me wrong but it is much smaller than I thought that it would be.</li>
            <li> beautiful tiara, everything expected a gift for my precious granddaughter.  I purchased the tiara so it will always be in her pocession as a treasured piece.</li>
            <li> After obsessing over the royal wedding, there was no better tiara choice for me. I received it as a gift for my sixteenth birthday. Nearly two years later, the tiara is still in perfect condition. It&#x27;s classy and chic and so pretty! The detail and shape of this tiara is absolutely amazing. The bend-ability of the crown is what I like most about it. It can be shaped to fit and work with any hairstyle. I received a lot of compliments on it and some of my favorite pictures ever taken were with this tiara on my head. I strongly recommend this tiara. I wanted something different from the cheap tiaras you can buy at the store, and I sure got exactly what I wanted with this tiara. You just cannot go wrong with this one. It sure will make you feel like a true princess!</li>
            <li> I purchased this tiara to wear for my wedding.  I LOVE it and got many compliments.  It does bend, but it&#x27;s not flimsy.  I found that bend was helpful to conform it around my updo.  It sparkles beautifully and is definitly worth the price.</li>
