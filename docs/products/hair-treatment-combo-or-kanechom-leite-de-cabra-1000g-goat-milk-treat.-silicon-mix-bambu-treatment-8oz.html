            <li>Didn&#x27;t see a difference in my 6 year old hair and her hair has a pretty good grain.</li>
            <li>I went from platinum blonde to red and my hair feels amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I feel like I have shed more hair since I used these products than I normally do.</li>
            <li>So anything that leaves my hair soft is a plus, but I think this will be a better review once my hair is a  bit longer.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I will try again with the amount of shedding I experienced.</li>
            <li>Incredibly strong, old flowers.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down...</li>
            <li>I currently have keratin treatment in my hair and this makes for a great hair mask as opposed to the top dollar masks that you are usually told to purchase in conjunction with the keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>At first I was like...</li>
            <li>An today is my first time using this product an</li>
            <li>The first time I tried these, I added Silcon Mix to Kanechom, and I didn&#x27;t like the results at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- I wore a plastic cap and wrapped with a hot towel to give my hair a heated treatment.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying the bambu mix</li>
            <li>my curls were defined, soft and shiny!!!!</li>
            <li>Also shipped pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Its purely neutral.</li>
            <li>I like the deep conditioner it was light</li>
            <li>got to me fast.  </li>
            <li>Silicon mix, not so much.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see a difference like some women say on youtube.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s making my hair very Oily</li>
            <li>kind of skeptical but way more convinced towards the end of the video.</li>
            <li>My braidout is soft, moisturized, shiny, lightweight and so well defined!!!</li>
            <li>First off it did not seem super silky as I thought, second</li>
            <li>Really growing my hair fast and has it quite soft</li>
            <li>I am natural and like to where my hair straight.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works for my natural curly kinki hair.</li>
            <li>Ok first off i am an African American woman with course dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li>So if your hair is thirsty an your tired of looking welcome to your final destination of conditioners.</li>
            <li>I usually wear my hair in many protective styles through the month that include updo&#x27;s and ponytail wraps( I add a drawstring ponytail) because I work out 5-6 days a week.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it out, my hair was softer and after air drying i noticed that my hair was light weight and fluffy.</li>
            <li>My hair is completely &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; no relaxer, no color.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as suggested.</li>
            <li>I where my hair in a bun until I am ready to co-wash it days later.</li>
            <li>I did a full blow dry and flat iron (</li>
            <li>an Sally&#x27;s from suave, live, Garnier, wrapping lotion, tresemme...just alot of regular and leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li>, I used Kanechom alone and the results were better, but not good enough for a repurchase.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and hydrated and after about an hour when my hair was mostly dry</li>
            <li>and I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference from the regular silicon mix and the container is half the size.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really growing my hair fast and has it quite soft</li>
            <li> The great reviews are true! Makes my hair feel salon smooth. I currently have keratin treatment in my hair and this makes for a great hair mask as opposed to the top dollar masks that you are usually told to purchase in conjunction with the keratin treatment. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, it&#x27;s not just hype.  I saw it recommended for &amp;#34;curly girls&amp;#34;  on YouTube and decided to try it, I&#x27;ve been using it ever since,  and recommended to many others also.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, smells great, is reasonably priced, and works better than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference in my 6 year old hair and her hair has a pretty good grain.</li>
            <li> I use a chemical relaxer about every 7-9 weeks to straighten my hair. I usually wear my hair in many protective styles through the month that include updo&#x27;s and ponytail wraps( I add a drawstring ponytail) because I work out 5-6 days a week. I wash my hair every 10-12 days depending on the style and I always include a deep conditioner at home and at the salon. I tried the Kanechom w/goat mik and Silica bamboo deep conditioner over the weekend and roller set my hair afterward. I like the deep conditioner it was light and my hair feels good. Looking forward to using the product again. Like everything in life it&#x27;s part of your body composition, nutrition, and vitamin supplements that may improve the condition of one&#x27;s hair journey. Good luck people... try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, love, love! I set this on for 30 minutes and my hair is super soft and just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good. How I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Honestly Love at First use!!! I have been ranting and raving about this product paired with their leave in for a few days now. My braidout is soft, moisturized, shiny, lightweight and so well defined!!! I will most def be ordering more. I have thick, recently color treated type 4 hair</li>
            <li> This came just as they said it would, It was well packaged. I have only used it once, i applied it as a pre-poo and sat under the dryer for 20 minutes. I rinsed it out, my hair was softer and after air drying i noticed that my hair was light weight and fluffy. Mind you, I am in the process of growing out a very short cut, that has been over processed with relaxers. So anything that leaves my hair soft is a plus, but I think this will be a better review once my hair is a  bit longer.</li>
            <li> I used this product after the rave review on Youtube and did not notice a difference in condition or texture. The lady in the video swore she saw a remarkable difference in split ends after the first use.</li>
            <li> tI leaves my hair moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product it is superb for your hair.</li>
            <li> Ok first off i am an African American woman with course dry damaged hair. I have tryed an bought alot of products that was suppose to provide this type of satisfaction. I &#x27;ve tired almost everything in Wal-Mart, hair stores an Sally&#x27;s from suave, live, Garnier, wrapping lotion, tresemme...just alot of regular and leave in conditioners. My hair was thirsty from leaving weaves in for a month an weeks in at a time.( My hair is long by the way lol)  I needed something that could last me so I ran across this girls video on YouTube that claimed this product worked. At first I was like...kind of skeptical but way more convinced towards the end of the video. So I came to my fav..place amazon looked at some other reviews but I didn&#x27;t let that stop me from trying this. I figured either way I will be wasting money in the long run if this don&#x27;t work. So I ordered this an it came in  5 days. An today is my first time using this product an it looks an feels like I have went to the  hair shop. So if your hair is thirsty an your tired of looking welcome to your final destination of conditioners. Idk who haten on this product. .if it works for me then it should work for you..straight up lol I will be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff for dry damaged hair!!! I went from platinum blonde to red and my hair feels amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Its a amazing product it works and smells great  got to me fast.  Thank you! I love it</li>
            <li> Love this product. It left my hair soft and hydrated and after about an hour when my hair was mostly dry my curls were defined, soft and shiny!!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried these, I added Silcon Mix to Kanechom, and I didn&#x27;t like the results at all.&lt;br /&gt;I think my hair doesn&#x27;t like glycerin or mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;For the second try, I used Kanechom alone and the results were better, but not good enough for a repurchase. I&#x27;ll stick to Nexxus Emergencee for protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of Kanechom is amazing. Silicon mix, not so much. Incredibly strong, old flowers.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair up ,will never use again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a difference like some women say on youtube. I don&#x27;t have to have this. I change to another product.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly and neatly(wrapped with tape as to avoid lids coming off)...the products are amazing for my bleached hair! Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down... nice product.</li>
            <li> I think it time for my to use another product it&#x27;s making my hair very Oily</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it religiously.</li>
            <li> **Hair type - I think I have type 4 very thick hair. It&#x27;s different textures all over. My hair is completely &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; no relaxer, no color.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as suggested. About 2 parts conditioner to one part silicon - I wore a plastic cap and wrapped with a hot towel to give my hair a heated treatment. I did a full blow dry and flat iron (as I would typically do without these products). First off it did not seem super silky as I thought, second I feel like I have shed more hair since I used these products than I normally do. The three star review for me is not good and not bad. Its purely neutral. Not sure if I will try again with the amount of shedding I experienced. If anyone has any suggestions to how I could use this differently let me know. I&#x27;m open to suggestions since I don&#x27;t want to waste the product.</li>
            <li> I love this combo. Kanechom is an excellent product and works great with Silicon Mix. This was my first time trying the bambu mix and I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference from the regular silicon mix and the container is half the size. Also shipped pretty fast. Within 4 days I think</li>
            <li> This product smells great. Cant use it each time you wash your hair because too much of protein is no good. But I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this combination. I am natural and like to where my hair straight. I comb the 1 cup of the protein to the 1/2 of the silicone mix through my hair as a leave-in. I where my hair in a bun until I am ready to co-wash it days later. Once I rinse it out I blow dry it and flat iron. My hair looks and feels smoother.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for my natural curly kinki hair.</li>
