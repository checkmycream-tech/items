            <li>Great razor!</li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>But once you get the hang of it you will get a great shave with this razor.</li>
            <li>It has a great feel in the hand and seems to be easier to control.</li>
            <li>Great product, I highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It has a good weight and heft to it.</li>
            <li>For the price its good.</li>
            <li>Steel quality is good.</li>
            <li>Maybe it needs a good honing.  </li>
            <li>It has good weight, but changing the blades is a bit treacherous.</li>
            <li>It is so great I liked :)</li>
            <li>Great price, and blades are inexpensive, and easy to change.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly inexpensive, decently stylish, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>and I liked the feel of it.</li>
            <li>This is a awesome straight razor</li>
            <li>This is a decently crafted razor for the money, and I thought it a very good purchase.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice weight and holds the blade nice and secure.  </li>
            <li>As far as shavettes go this is easily the best of them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It just puts more responsibility on you to control the blade.</li>
            <li>and I put this through the test for how many times I&#x27;ve dropped it and</li>
            <li>Love the Dreadnought products.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed how much more precision</li>
            <li>This shavette looks good, but does not have the right feel.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s a pretty good Shavette.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remind me of a cheap box cutter, like most of them.</li>
            <li>I love that it so clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li>The blade holding mechanism is all metal, and quite easy to load your blades.  </li>
            <li>Good solid feel and a nice weight in the hand.  </li>
            <li>I think it is just fine.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that if you have the straight razor technique down and try this inexpensive and unassuming razor, you may well have the best shave you have ever had in your life.  </li>
            <li>But it gives a fantastic shave if you know how to handle it.</li>
            <li>I would lightly oil the blade holder</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s smooth sailing after that.</li>
            <li>I have a Dovo 6/8 and a Thiers Issard 4/8 and really enjoy shaving with either and don&#x27;t mind the stropping and maintenance that is inherent to their use.  </li>
            <li>It has some weight, so it feels more like a real straight razor.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy shaving with this product.</li>
            <li>The quality is not bad for the price .</li>
            <li>I picked up a box of shark half blades that seem to fit well and deliver a great controlled shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got this Item in time, first impression: it is so nice well balanced not cheap plastic handle, and shavette  itself is good material and organized.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver and if you don&#x27;t want to bother with maintaining a traditional straight razor</li>
            <li>and I got lucky</li>
            <li>My first shave wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I hoped</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably love it when I get used to the added weight on it compared to my old razor.</li>
            <li>I own another shavette, a parker and did a comparison, the blade of Dreadnought is almost double exposed than the Parker shavette.</li>
            <li>Also the one I got did not close right.</li>
            <li>But with my supply of 100 or so Astra razor blades, originally bought for my excellent Edwin Jagger DE, I can now snap these blades in half and use each half 2-3 times in the dreadnought razor.</li>
            <li>this is a very reasonable alternative.</li>
            <li>I was on the fence and was considering buying one for him with a much higher price tag</li>
            <li>fashioned way&amp;#34; and this Shavette works exactly like his shaves.</li>
            <li>I use a traditional straight razor most of the time</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only thing say negatively about this straight razor is that the handle feels light and cheap which kind of throws off the balance of the blade end.</li>
            <li>While it does have a bit more heft than a typical shavette it still does not feel like a real straight.</li>
            <li>They fit nicely and do not stick out as much as the double edge blades that you must brake in half.</li>
            <li>Does the job just fine without the cost of a fancy traditional straight razor.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of ancient Greece, so the Corinthian helmet logo with the crossed swords is a big plus in my book.</li>
            <li>I really like this straight razor.</li>
            <li>it is very durable.</li>
            <li>Shaving feels much easier using this than using a lighter and/or plastic handle.</li>
            <li>It shaves like a straight razor should.</li>
            <li>It gave me a very close shave</li>
            <li>If you are a straight razor beginner, or just want to have a shavette in your rotation for those days</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t feel like stropping your real SR</li>
            <li>Got this to go along with my Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Razor.</li>
            <li>I have to say this shaves much closer than the Parker does.</li>
            <li>The handle is plastic, but seems very durable, and the blade holder is a nice stainless steel (not sure).  </li>
            <li>But on a whim I tried the Dreadnought shavette which unlike other shavettes has the same classic design as these razors and would seem like a good travel razor when on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to shavettes, and it&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but this one is pretty well put together, and has decent weight.</li>
            <li>Its not as good as Feather Shavette, but that costs abut $100, so that is not a fair comparison.  </li>
            <li>With that said, it&#x27;s got the feel of a true straight razor, but I would go with a Dovo shavette for just a little more money if I were just starting.</li>
            <li>One thing I noticed right away is that it was so much sharper than my regular razors</li>
            <li>With that said I still highly recommend this for the price.</li>
            <li>you want to pay a little more try the Parker.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with real straight razors for the last 2 years or so.  </li>
            <li>not light weight bendable tin can material, as with most others).</li>
            <li>snapped in half as I use single edge blades that fit fine.</li>
            <li>I would note that an earlier review stated that the blade sticks out further than most shavettes, which is both true and a little unforgiving for someone trying it &amp;#34;on for size&amp;#34;, especially if the blade is one of the super sharp ones like those made by Feather.  </li>
            <li>He loves this model and once he got over the learning curve of a straight razor shave, he said he&#x27;d never go back.</li>
            <li>This one far exceeds all of them.</li>
            <li>Yes, I do have an old barber that still shaves the &amp;#34;old</li>
            <li>The metal has a far heavier weight than the plastic handle</li>
            <li>I shaved just as I would with my regular straight razors.</li>
            <li>It can be less forgiving than a straight razor because DE blades are sharper and little mistakes are more likely to bite you.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is a better shavette than the $40 Dovo, and it costs less than half the price.  </li>
            <li>and I barely felt I was shaving at all.  </li>

            <li> My husband uses this everyday and he loves it. I was on the fence and was considering buying one for him with a much higher price tag and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. He loves this model and once he got over the learning curve of a straight razor shave, he said he&#x27;d never go back.</li>
            <li> As far as shavettes go this is easily the best of them. I tried the Parker version, Dovo, some other generic one I got from a local beauty supply store. This one far exceeds all of them. I will say I do not use this regularly. I use a traditional straight razor most of the time and I got this for taking on the road. While it does have a bit more heft than a typical shavette it still does not feel like a real straight. But it gives a fantastic shave if you know how to handle it. It can be less forgiving than a straight razor because DE blades are sharper and little mistakes are more likely to bite you. But once you get the hang of it you will get a great shave with this razor. It is well made and well designed. I noticed some have complained about too much blade being exposed. I think it is just fine. It just puts more responsibility on you to control the blade. This is a great shaver and if you don&#x27;t want to bother with maintaining a traditional straight razor this is a very reasonable alternative.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s a pretty good Shavette.  It has a nice weight and holds the blade nice and secure.  I suggest using precut de blades, because for some strange reason, the blade is overexposed when using the regular de blades. I use the precut derby blades.  The handle is plastic, but seems very durable, and the blade holder is a nice stainless steel (not sure).  I would lightly oil the blade holder just incase to prevent any type of rusting.  It arrived fast, on time, and the only complaint I have is that the blade holder was scratched, but that doesnâ€™t compromise the shave.</li>
            <li> Very basic, a bit on the heavy side</li>
            <li> I really like this straight razor. It&#x27;s fairly inexpensive, decently stylish, and gets the job done. I picked up a box of shark half blades that seem to fit well and deliver a great controlled shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing say negatively about this straight razor is that the handle feels light and cheap which kind of throws off the balance of the blade end. Don&#x27;t get me wrong when I say it feels cheap. I travel often and I put this through the test for how many times I&#x27;ve dropped it and it is very durable. With that said I still highly recommend this for the price.</li>
            <li> It is so great I liked :)</li>
            <li> This is a decently crafted razor for the money, and I thought it a very good purchase.

            <li> Love the Dreadnought products.  Good solid feel and a nice weight in the hand.  Shaving feels much easier using this than using a lighter and/or plastic handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shavettes, and it&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but this one is pretty well put together, and has decent weight.</li>
            <li> Ordinarily, I&#x27;m not impressed with shavettes, preferring a regular straight razor instead. But this Dreadnought impresses me. It has a good weight and heft to it. It is solid and made of quality materials. It doesn&#x27;t remind me of a cheap box cutter, like most of them. I&#x27;m sorry, but those Dovo shavettes look like box cutters to me! I put a Derby pre-cut razor in it, and noticed that it stayed in place when I closed the holder and secured it with a solid gauge metal clip, (not light weight bendable tin can material, as with most others). It shaves like a straight razor should. Great price, and blades are inexpensive, and easy to change. I recommend it, and may order another one.</li>
            <li> I love it. Just getting used to this. I love that it so clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li> Guys, what can I say, it works just as it works when I shave with my barber. Yes, I do have an old barber that still shaves the &amp;#34;old fashioned way&amp;#34; and this Shavette works exactly like his shaves. If you do it yourself it&#x27;ll take a couple of shaves to get the hang of it, but rest assured you will and it&#x27;s smooth sailing after that. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> For the price its good. Plastic handle. Steel quality is good. Ive left this thing dirty and wet for days often and it hasnt rusted. Ive owned it for about 3 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to pay a little more try the Parker. The Parker comes with a steel handle and looks nicer. IMHO this plastic handle gets the job done just as well for 1/3 the price. Doesn&#x27;t look too shabby either.</li>
            <li> I like it. I&#x27;ll probably love it when I get used to the added weight on it compared to my old razor. The metal has a far heavier weight than the plastic handle so it seems a bit lopsided in terms of weigh not length. I can&#x27;t agree with others saying the blade is too exposed. I use shark blades so you know.</li>
            <li> Got this Item in time, first impression: it is so nice well balanced not cheap plastic handle, and shavette  itself is good material and organized. But when I charge it with a single blade razor shark, the blade is too exposed. I own another shavette, a parker and did a comparison, the blade of Dreadnought is almost double exposed than the Parker shavette. For a beginner I will not advice this shavette, it is to risky. Shaving with this it took me double the time of a parker and I got lucky I did not cut myself.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with real straight razors for the last 2 years or so.  I have a Dovo 6/8 and a Thiers Issard 4/8 and really enjoy shaving with either and don&#x27;t mind the stropping and maintenance that is inherent to their use.  But on a whim I tried the Dreadnought shavette which unlike other shavettes has the same classic design as these razors and would seem like a good travel razor when on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then tried it out. I shaved just as I would with my regular straight razors. One thing I noticed right away is that it was so much sharper than my regular razors and I barely felt I was shaving at all.  Then I noticed how much more precision I had shaving tricky bits like around the lips and chin.  Then I rinsed my face and realized it felt literally like glass.  I can honestly say that if you have the straight razor technique down and try this inexpensive and unassuming razor, you may well have the best shave you have ever had in your life.  I am now completely hooked and my Dovo and Thiers Issard are being horribly neglected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried my Dovo again the other day and after my regular routine felt downright scruffy.  Maybe it needs a good honing.  But with my supply of 100 or so Astra razor blades, originally bought for my excellent Edwin Jagger DE, I can now snap these blades in half and use each half 2-3 times in the dreadnought razor. This amounts to 400-600 unsurpassed shaves.  So why bother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Astra-Superior-Premium-Platinum-Double/dp/B001QY8QXM?SubscriptionId&#x3D;AKIAJHSFDPAMIEHZAERQ&amp;tag&#x3D;shaverinformationformen-20&amp;linkCode&#x3D;xm2&amp;camp&#x3D;2025&amp;creative&#x3D;165953&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B001QY8QXM</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is a better shavette than the $40 Dovo, and it costs less than half the price.  No plastic inserts here, folks.  The blade holding mechanism is all metal, and quite easy to load your blades.  It has some weight, so it feels more like a real straight razor.  Its not as good as Feather Shavette, but that costs abut $100, so that is not a fair comparison.  It gave me a very close shave and I liked the feel of it. If you are a straight razor beginner, or just want to have a shavette in your rotation for those days you don&#x27;t feel like stropping your real SR, this is a solid choice for the money.</li>
            <li> The quality is not bad for the price . It needed some cleaning up when I received it , there was polishing&lt;br /&gt;compound that was stuck in the razor . My first shave wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I hoped but I will try different&lt;br /&gt;razor blades and or shaving creams .</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine without the cost of a fancy traditional straight razor. There&#x27;s also hardly any maintenance. Rinse off, air dry, swap blade as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to supplement to my safety razor. I would recommended this item.</li>
            <li> Great razor! Got this to go along with my Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Razor. I have to say this shaves much closer than the Parker does. It has a great feel in the hand and seems to be easier to control. I can&#x27;t comment on others experiences with double edge blades snapped in half as I use single edge blades that fit fine. Seems to be well made, but, of course time will tell. Can&#x27;t recommend this razor enough.</li>
            <li> This shavette looks good, but does not have the right feel. Also the one I got did not close right. So, with that said I returned it and got my money back.</li>
            <li> It has good weight, but changing the blades is a bit treacherous. Each time I change the blade, I just know that I am going to have to have a finger reattached.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy shaving with this product. Plus I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of ancient Greece, so the Corinthian helmet logo with the crossed swords is a big plus in my book. I recommend the Shark brand Saloon style half blades. They fit nicely and do not stick out as much as the double edge blades that you must brake in half.

            <li> Great product, I highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a awesome straight razor</li>
