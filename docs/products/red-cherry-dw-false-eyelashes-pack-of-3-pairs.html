            <li>I love the fullness and &amp;#34;whispy&amp;#34; nature of the lashes as I have dark hair (also hair replacement).  </li>
            <li>While I love #43 for glamorous looks, they are a little much for daytime.</li>
            <li>Get lots of compliments on this particular lash.  </li>
            <li>They are very light on your eyes and just need a little bit of glue.  </li>
            <li>Love&#x27;em very natural looking lasts longer than any other brand!</li>
            <li>Not too long and not too short :)</li>
            <li>but this is the right length and fullness for that added extra.</li>
            <li>THESE ARE MY NEW GO TO LASHES!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They look very natural and can be stacked.</li>

            <li>they look natural and i like the wispy look!</li>
            <li>so they blend well to your natural eyelashes!</li>
            <li>They arent too long and create a thick lash line , good for an evening out.</li>
            <li>They are pretty long</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s so natural looking.</li>
            <li>they look natural</li>
            <li>Also, they will need to be trimmed to fit small eyes.</li>
            <li>They are really full and fluffy for me, so I cut them up and wear them in pieces or halves-</li>
            <li>I am new to the red cherry lash craze</li>
            <li>and I barely notice them.</li>

            <li> I have naturally long lashes and with these lashes they look natural</li>
            <li> These are lovely false eyelashes but are still WAY TOO long for me.  </li>
            <li> Like the fact that they wispy and very natural looking when you trim the length down.  </li>
            <li> However, to make them look a natural as possible, you really need to trim them ; thus I would not buy them unless you knew what you were doing or you didn&#x27;t care that people knew you were wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> They look really weird and cheap.</li>
            <li> Can never seem to get fake eyelashes to fit well and stay put.</li>
            <li> But if u have long eyelashes, pick something else.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> You can re-use them as long as you take care of them.</li>
            <li> Not TOO long, while still being long!</li>
            <li> The only problems I have had with them are due to user error.</li>
            <li> Too long and wide .. needed a lot of trimming.</li>
            <li> They look like naturally lush and fluttery lashes- and surprisingly subtle.</li>
            <li> these are for an everyday wear they are not that noticable</li>
            <li> I dislike how it pricks out randomly, doesn&#x27;t look natural at all</li>
            <li> I initially bought another brand name, at a department store, but ended up disliking those as they looked too fake for my taste.</li>
            <li> so I would not recommend them for people with small eyes, they would be too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year user of false eyelashes due to Alopecia Universalis, so I have to use the lashes as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too dramatic so that you can use them everyday</li>
            <li> but I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to do that with ALL of the false eyelashes that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I will always stock up on this style of False Eyelashes</li>
            <li> Why would anyone want to wear false eyelashes that make your eyes look like you&#x27;re wearing fuzzy caterpillars on your eyelids?</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about these lashes.</li>

            <li> I initially bought another brand name, at a department store, but ended up disliking those as they looked too fake for my taste. I looked for a cheaper option and found these Red Cherries. These are awesome, they are full enough to give the desired effect, but does not look fake. I would definitely recommend and buy again. Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> Cute! Cute! Cute! Nothing bad to say about these lashes. I shared one of the packs with a friend and I regret it :P They are def stingy worthy!</li>

            <li> Super fast shipping, and these are really gorgeous.  They are really full and fluffy for me, so I cut them up and wear them in pieces or halves- but it depends on the look your going for.  They have a really nice, natural wispyness to them that give them a great &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look that I love.</li>
            <li> Very spider like. Too long and wide .. needed a lot of trimming. Revlon kiss lashes are a million times better</li>
            <li> This is my go to lash for instant glamour. My style is a bit too reserved for some of red cherry lashes but this is the right length and fullness for that added extra. Definitely buying more of these.</li>

            <li> Pretty natural shape, I am Asian, I don&#x27;t have to cute the eyelashes width to fit my eyes. It is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Most of girls with shorter eyelashes can use this. But if u have long eyelashes, pick something else.&lt;br /&gt;But it is very cheap anyway, plus u can wear it for as many time as u want. It is worth it.</li>

            <li> Love these lashes and for the price getting 3 pairs was a great deal!!</li>
            <li> These lashes are a must!! They aren&#x27;t too dramatic so that you can use them everyday but they add enough &amp;#34;vava voom&amp;#34; to turn some heads! Very easy to apply and remove! If you don&#x27;t have these YOU NEED TO GET THEM!!</li>
            <li> Great lashes, geat for beginners who want a noticeable but natural look. I also love the shipping, came really quickly. I love the fact that you get 3 pairs, which last a while with proper usage, for a great price!</li>
            <li> Red Cherry lashes! The greatest! While I love #43 for glamorous looks, they are a little much for daytime. These are perfect for day time but still gorgeous! Not TOO long, while still being long!</li>
            <li> Out of the red cherrys ive tried this one seems to be my favorite. They arent too long and create a thick lash line , good for an evening out. They look natrual which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I am new to the red cherry lash craze but I can say that now I know what all the fuss is about. I am sold.</li>
            <li> Love&#x27;em very natural looking lasts longer than any other brand!</li>
            <li> I ordered it last week and got it within the proper time frame with no complications or delays. I love these lashes! They&#x27;re universal you can dress them up with additional mascara or keep them the way they are on a regular day. TIP: You can re-use them as long as you take care of them. I clean them after two uses with eye make-up remover and a clean mascara wand.</li>
            <li> These are lovely false eyelashes but are still WAY TOO long for me.  I can trim them but I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to do that with ALL of the false eyelashes that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Why would anyone want to wear false eyelashes that make your eyes look like you&#x27;re wearing fuzzy caterpillars on your eyelids?</li>
