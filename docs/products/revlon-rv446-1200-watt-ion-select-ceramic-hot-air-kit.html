            <li>I absolutley love this product!</li>
            <li>This hot air brush is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Sells for a lot more on ebay!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this hot air kit.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This hairdryer straightens them perfectly with large curl for some body.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own way.</li>
            <li>Liked the color.</li>
            <li>or I should say to get a nice weave.</li>
            <li>Having the cool setting is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and the attachments popped off once or twice very easily when they shouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased it, I loved it!</li>
            <li>The heat that comes out is very hot, and the attachments are great.     </li>
            <li>I immediately ran out and bought another one, and my hair was pretty, shiny, wavy, silky and beautiful again.</li>
            <li>Easy, Breezy!</li>
            <li>Easy, Breezy!</li>
            <li>Other wise its great!!</li>
            <li>Bliss Great product - reasonable price - try it!</li>
            <li>Overall, the product is great and Amazon seems to have the best price right now at $27 with shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, and the swivel cord keeps it from being cumbersome to use.  </li>
            <li>great attachments option with easy off button, gave me more volume at my roots, dries my hair quickly, brush doesn&#x27;t eat my hair.    </li>
            <li>am NOT a style-oriented person, I was never taught how to style my hair, and for many, many years, I wore it up in a bun, or scrunchie, or pig/ponytails</li>
            <li>I am now 29, and have went though many.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>A BETTER product is the Helen of Troy air brush.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this dryer/styler</li>
            <li>I wish Revlon would come up with a better design for the attachments.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and drys my hair faster and gives it more body and shine.  </li>
            <li>I hope Revlon doesn&#x27;t phase this type of dryer out, as I love it.  </li>
            <li>It dries your hair ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I got this brush as it made my hair smoother and gave me a more put together look.  </li>
            <li>Most curling items get caught and tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li>There many of these types of products on the market today.  </li>
            <li>It was fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Also, I love the fact that I now have no dry/frizzy looking ends</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this purchase and thought I loved the product when I first brought it home.</li>
            <li>used it successfully (and fairly gently) for about 9 months</li>
            <li>The 1.5\\&quot; is best for long hair or to do body.  </li>
            <li>This 1200w model dries quickly and styles nicely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because I travel frequently.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought one for my daughter and daughter-in-law.  </li>
            <li>Stars for: effectiveness, portability (easy to pack), and making me look pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Minus a Star for: breaks too often, and I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;pink\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Stars for: effectiveness, portability (easy to pack), and making me look pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Minus a Star for: breaks too often, and I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;pink\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Easy to use, lots of heating options,</li>
            <li>The concentrator attachment works wonderfully if you still want to contort your body with your favorite round brush.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length, fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but I have lots of it.  </li>
            <li>, I have fine hair so the switch adjusts the drier to ensuring that my hair does not over-dry out causing it to go frizzy or electric.  </li>
            <li>and she has fine hair</li>
            <li>Of all the brush blow dryers I have owned (mostly conair over the past 20 years) this is the best.</li>
            <li>However, I have fine hair, which I wear in a</li>
            <li>dryer works well, dries quickly, and leaves your hair shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I had to use two hands just to roll it because it was kind of large for my hand.</li>
            <li>I get much more volume in my hair and the style remains throughout the day and does not fall out - which is a first!</li>
            <li>and I have smooth hair turned under at the ends.  </li>
            <li>For an extra [...] bucks or so, which got me free shipping, I got a much more superior product</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use</li>
            <li>Since it was cheap and both Ionic and Ceramic, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I had to hold the hair on the brush with my free hand which defeats the purpose of having an all-in-one dryer.  </li>
            <li>The ceramic is nice because it heats up fast and evenly, styling products also don&#x27;t seem to stick or stain.  </li>
            <li>When I leave there, I look fabulous</li>
            <li>My hair styles are sleek and smooth -- no frizz anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I still own an older model</li>
            <li>The brush bristles are pretty soft and I think someone with longer and/or thicker hair would not be as happy with this model as I am.</li>
            <li>It has a unique system that can be adjusted according to hair-type - for instance</li>
            <li>I have never owned a hot air brush dryer before, but I am so glad that I tried it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the blower.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>A bit noisy, but definately worth it!</li>
            <li>Small sacrifice for salon beautiful hair!    </li>
            <li>However, for my mother, who has very thick and healthy hair, it worked perfectly for her.  </li>
            <li>Handle too big to hold well and too powerful, makes hair fly.  </li>
            <li>I loved the way it saved time by drying and styling my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li>I had a similar blower for years, which I loved, but its power was rather anemic.  </li>
            <li>My very processed hair looks healthy and shiny after using this brush.  </li>
            <li>Roll the hair in, turn on the hot air, then the cool air, and you&#x27;ve got body and style!  </li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S PINK MY FAVORITE COLOR!!</li>
            <li>From the reviews I&#x27;ve read though, they all seam to die relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>to change attachments quickly.</li>
            <li>i have very straight hair, so it doesnt make as huge a difference on my hair as on my friends&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>when using heat to style it and this tool still toasted my hair--it gets VERY VERY hot.       </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased and thinking of getting another to hold on to keep</li>
            <li>I LIKE THIS PRODUCT VERY MUCH!</li>
            <li>I can achieve great result in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; dries hair fast.  </li>
            <li>The second set seems to work fine, and do all that it is supposed to do, however, I can not seem to figure out what it is suposed to do. :-)</li>
            <li>I have used hot air brushes before, and I prefer them to separate hair dryers and brushes, but this one is much better than my older ones.  </li>
            <li>and I never did like how the picture showed a girl with perfect curls that for my type of hair (very thick)</li>
            <li>The Revlon on the other hand was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>I think my hair is stubborn because it doesn&#x27;t do well with a straight iron either, but I just might be buying cheap products.</li>
            <li>and my hair is silky, shiny, straight, wavy, and gorgeous (for the next 2 days!).</li>
            <li>Feel like I got my monies worth and would order again from this company.</li>
            <li>But this is no big deal, great for frequent traveler in a rush.</li>
            <li>They have told several people how much they loved it and their friends are also buying it.  </li>
            <li>This tool is a powerful styling tool.</li>
            <li>I use it on my very curly hair, to get it more straight</li>
            <li>This was well worth the money</li>
            <li>This is even BETTER than my old one (also Revlon).  </li>
            <li>I liked it enough to order another one.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful hair dryer, brush combo.</li>
            <li>It heats up well, and is extremely loud like many others have reviewed.</li>
            <li>This one is great for smoothing out my hair because it has the ion feature....but only drawback is that it is too loud.</li>
            <li>It will seem ackward at first (if you are used to using brush and blow dryer) but get used to it quickly.    </li>
            <li>I bought this product as a gift, the first one i bought didn&#x27;t work at all, however i returned it, and got a replacement really quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the adjustable ionic setting (I have long, fine hair and use the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting)so you don&#x27;t \\&quot;overdo\\&quot; the ions.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, salon blow dry right at your house and FREE!</li>
            <li>To be honest, I am not a pink person, and this was the least attractive of the group but the performance makes up for</li>
            <li>I purchased this product on the advise of a friend and was she right.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t get it right.      </li>
            <li>Apparently it works faster and better than a hair dryer with a separate brush.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to help give my hair a bit more boost and lift than my old brush.  </li>
            <li>Finally found it for my sister here on Amazon for considerably more than I paid, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>It shapes my hair exactly as I tell it to in exactly the right spots.  </li>
            <li>This product works very fast and I like how my hair looks after I&#x27;ve used it.    </li>
            <li>the barrel gets really hot, so it acts as a curling iron as well.  </li>
            <li>I have duct taped the brush cylinder to the dryer but the metal areas get too hot for the tape to adhere.  </li>
            <li>I might return it for that reason, even though it did the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>You can not hold on the end to help hold it because it is to hot.</li>
            <li>provides a much more consistent heat, which is a big improvement to avoid spot overheating.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first one in November of 2008 at Walmart.</li>
            <li>and I used products, but I couldn&#x27;t get this hot air brush to curl my hair under or flipped out.</li>
            <li>is that you can&#x27;t hold the tip of the brush attachments because they get too hot.  </li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t take care of all the fly aways especially small hair at the top of the head that stand up wierd due to static.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and have been using one for years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>IT is good quality and will cut down your styling time in half, LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>I would have paid a bit extra to have an \\&quot;easy cleaning\\&quot; feature on this.  </li>
            <li>The Revlon hairdrier I purchased has certainly exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford to loose any more of my hearing.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thinning and this gives it just enough oomph.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this kit as a replacement for an older Revlon Hot Air styler.  </li>
            <li>The high setting gets really hot and so does the brush area.</li>
            <li>It left her hair smooth (but her hair doesnt see much chemicals or product like mine.)</li>
            <li>My hair turns frizzy to smooth and under total control all day until washing again with this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter was visiting and now she wants one.</li>
            <li>I have very bushy hair and this tool takes all the frizz out.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer works very well.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li>The lower setting is much quieter.  </li>
            <li>It dries and styles my hair much faster.  </li>
            <li>You really should wear ear plugs to protect your hearing.  </li>
            <li>Hair type: medium in thickness, very abused (colored, bleached, permed, relaxed, you name it</li>
            <li>Cons:    made my hair very \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; looking, didnt get rid of much frizz,</li>
            <li>IT MUCH EASIER THEN HOLDING A BLOWER IN ONE HAND AND</li>
            <li>I guess because I didn&#x27;t have to worry about coordination so much.     </li>
            <li>either straight, waves or curls.  </li>
            <li>I have used Conair hot air brushes and liked them, but I couldn&#x27;t find one with a 1\\&quot; bristled barrel for my growing but not yet long enough for a 1.25\\&quot; diameter barrel hair.</li>
            <li>I have a huge plastic tub full of similar hair dryers because I couldn&#x27;t find the same one</li>
            <li>I use it daily on my bangs and they look great, no more flat-looking bangs.</li>
            <li>really only use the smaller brush (I&#x27;ve owned three, and the original one I bought came with a straightener/curling iron attachment, which was cool,</li>
            <li>This new pink one is nicer, came with more gadgets and is made stronger.</li>
            <li>It really adds shine and is simple and quick to use.</li>
            <li>The barrel gets VERY VERY HOT whether using low or high air flow!      </li>
            <li>In March, 2008, the heating element stopped working and only cool air came out, so I exchanged it for another one.</li>
            <li>I keep it on low, as the sound is very loud when on high.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely no good at blowing out my own fine hair with a brush and regular hairblower.  </li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the ion and ceramic features which my older model did not have.  </li>
            <li>As with my older model, the attachments sometimes do not stay attached.  </li>
            <li>I have used older models of the Revlon Air Brush for many years, usually using a blow dryer first.  </li>
            <li>I like the bristles and heat/power settings on this particular model, so</li>
            <li>Also, it is a little bigger(taller) in size than I expected,so doesn&#x27;t fit in the place I designated for it, but easily fits in the pull out drawer next to the sink.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I looked and researched other hot air brushes before I bought it, and with 1200 watts, it definitely had more power than others.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who wants their hair to be shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair stays shiny and soft the whole day</li>
            <li>It is so much better than using a round brush and blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off with a round brush and blowdryer.</li>
            <li>Two weeks ago after an expensive cut and color, I was ready to cry over my many sad attempts at recreating the artistic rendition my stylist provided of my now beautiful cut and color.      </li>
            <li>I normally use the larger brush for overall fullness, but the smaller brush works great to create more dramatic spirals and waves in my hair when i feel the urge.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Air Brush of any brand I have ever used that I do not need to dry my hair first.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have too much adjustability on the heat setting (just low and high), but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  </li>
            <li>My hair is wavy to the point of nearly curly, and I used this tool to blow it straight with Organix hair serum, and the results were straighter and nice than with a regular and round brush.</li>
            <li>The hair waving against the scalp made it hard to reach with drier and straight iron, but with the revlon hot air brush, I have a free hand to pull the hair away from my scalp.</li>
            <li>but I hope they can send me a new one.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I went shopping for a new gizmo or gadget that just might work.</li>
            <li>Although it does a good-enough job, I dislike it intensely because 1) the air flow is much too intense, 2) it is far too noisy, 3) low heat setting isn&#x27;t hot enough but medium</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, although there is a slight lurning curve.</li>
            <li>For me this is far easier and gives better results than trying to use a round brush with a separate hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because it&#x27;s so loud and doesn&#x27;t seem to be much more than a hair dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li>If you ask me, the only improvement this kit should have had may be a compact storage case to match the Hot Air Kit for travel.</li>
            <li>This is the second hot brush I have purchased from Revlon aka Helen of Troy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been serching for a while for a hot air brush to replace my last one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this tool, as it is so much easier to use than a regular drier and round brush.</li>
            <li>I got this to replace an old ionic hot air brush I had that knonked out finally.  </li>
            <li>I look salon fresh every single time I use it.      </li>
            <li>Ifeel really happy - nothing gets one down more than a bad hair day</li>
            <li>The cold shot works great to set my style.</li>
            <li>I find it much easier than blow drying with a regular hair dryer and brush and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>And naturally... I can&#x27;t find another one anywhere.</li>
            <li>However, it is so loud that I cannot bear to use it.</li>
            <li>This one did work like a dream, but i just COULD NOT take how loud it was...</li>
            <li>The soft vinyl head does NOT burn my hair.  </li>
            <li>that the old one I bought for about $[...].  </li>
            <li>and it just stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li>You can direct the heat where you want it without your hair flying everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s convenient and that I only need to use one hand.  </li>
            <li>I have a professional version of this which I use at our home in Asia.  </li>
            <li>The drier is powerful and my hair dried much quicker.</li>
            <li>Could use better bristles for holding thick hair.</li>
            <li>It looks cute, is really convenient to have, but is a poor investment.  </li>
            <li>til it&#x27;s all dry and pretty.</li>
            <li>Overall, I woudl say it is a decent product.</li>
            <li>This type of loose bristle brush is also much better than the plastic teeth or tight bristle &#x27;brush&#x27; types.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 62 years young (she really does not look like she&#x27;s 62) and doesnt have any issues handling this, and not having to blow dry her hair with one hand and</li>
            <li>My hair is long, straight and has layers</li>
            <li>As others have observed, the dryer is loud on the highest setting because it is powerful, so you might want to stuff a little cotton in your ears before drying.  </li>
            <li>You do have to get used to doing you hair with this product, I would suggest parting your hair in sections and MAKE sure you hair is damp not dripping wet!, less product you have in your hair</li>
            <li>I really like the capacity to dry and curl and having two sizes of brushes</li>
            <li>The one time I really needed to blow dry my hair, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time buying this product, simply because my old one just died on me after 2 years of use!!!</li>
            <li>With this tool, I can have gorgeous hair in about 10 mins (sometimes, I let it dry a little, naturally, then it only takes 5 mins \\&quot;under the dryer\\&quot; and less stress on my hair).</li>
            <li>Unlike some kits which come with tons of attachments, and I could only use half but paid the wholet kit in full.  </li>
            <li>My hair is med - fine texture and on the thick side</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the brush doesn&#x27;t hold my hair very easily since my hair is too thin and doesn&#x27;t catch in the bristles.</li>
            <li>I have thin straight hair and it gives a nice fluffiness and a little volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>and general quality- flimsy bristles that didn&#x27;t hold the hair and than fell out.  </li>
            <li>It smoothed and styled my bleach blonde tresses as well as my professional equipment.</li>
            <li>I am fast, but not fast enough.  </li>
            <li>and I can actually blow dry my hair every morning without getting up too early !!</li>
            <li>It is louder and the barrel is a little bigger, but the power, heavy ceramic coating, and quality bristles (firmer and well attached) more than made up for it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no doubt fine for long, thick hair; mine is ear-length, thin and fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried buying every round brush, flat iron, curling iron, hot air brush and even a waving iron to attempt somewhat similar results.  </li>
            <li>I spotted this little number and opted to try it, but swore it would be my absolute last styling gadget.</li>

            <li> This is a very nice dryer styler.  </li>
            <li> Curls hair under perfectly and great for adding volume on top.</li>
            <li> But ive used it on my girlfreinds and it ccreates the most perfect blow out ever.</li>

            <li> Ion one, just because of the good reviews posted.  </li>
            <li> The 1\\&quot; is good for making curls.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this product!</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Sells for a lot more on ebay!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this hot air kit.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer straightens them perfectly with large curl for some body.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own way.</li>
            <li> Liked the color.</li>
            <li> or I should say to get a nice weave.</li>
            <li> Having the cool setting is very nice.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and the attachments popped off once or twice very easily when they shouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased it, I loved it!</li>
            <li> The heat that comes out is very hot, and the attachments are great.     </li>
            <li> I immediately ran out and bought another one, and my hair was pretty, shiny, wavy, silky and beautiful again.</li>
            <li> Easy, Breezy!</li>
            <li> Easy, Breezy!</li>
            <li> Other wise its great!!</li>
            <li> Bliss Great product - reasonable price - try it!</li>
            <li> Overall, the product is great and Amazon seems to have the best price right now at $27 with shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, and the swivel cord keeps it from being cumbersome to use.  </li>
            <li> great attachments option with easy off button, gave me more volume at my roots, dries my hair quickly, brush doesn&#x27;t eat my hair.    </li>
            <li> am NOT a style-oriented person, I was never taught how to style my hair, and for many, many years, I wore it up in a bun, or scrunchie, or pig/ponytails</li>
            <li> I am now 29, and have went though many.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> A BETTER product is the Helen of Troy air brush.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this dryer/styler</li>
            <li> I wish Revlon would come up with a better design for the attachments.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and drys my hair faster and gives it more body and shine.  </li>
            <li> I hope Revlon doesn&#x27;t phase this type of dryer out, as I love it.  </li>
            <li> It dries your hair ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I got this brush as it made my hair smoother and gave me a more put together look.  </li>
            <li> Most curling items get caught and tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li> There many of these types of products on the market today.  </li>
            <li> It was fabulous!  </li>
            <li> Also, I love the fact that I now have no dry/frizzy looking ends</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this purchase and thought I loved the product when I first brought it home.</li>
            <li> used it successfully (and fairly gently) for about 9 months</li>
            <li> The 1.5\\&quot; is best for long hair or to do body.  </li>
            <li> This 1200w model dries quickly and styles nicely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because I travel frequently.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought one for my daughter and daughter-in-law.  </li>
            <li> Stars for: effectiveness, portability (easy to pack), and making me look pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Minus a Star for: breaks too often, and I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;pink\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Stars for: effectiveness, portability (easy to pack), and making me look pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Minus a Star for: breaks too often, and I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;pink\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Easy to use, lots of heating options,</li>
            <li> The concentrator attachment works wonderfully if you still want to contort your body with your favorite round brush.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length, fine hair</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but I have lots of it.  </li>
            <li> , I have fine hair so the switch adjusts the drier to ensuring that my hair does not over-dry out causing it to go frizzy or electric.  </li>
            <li> and she has fine hair</li>
            <li> Of all the brush blow dryers I have owned (mostly conair over the past 20 years) this is the best.</li>
            <li> However, I have fine hair, which I wear in a</li>
            <li> dryer works well, dries quickly, and leaves your hair shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I had to use two hands just to roll it because it was kind of large for my hand.</li>
            <li> I get much more volume in my hair and the style remains throughout the day and does not fall out - which is a first!</li>
            <li> and I have smooth hair turned under at the ends.  </li>
            <li> For an extra [...] bucks or so, which got me free shipping, I got a much more superior product</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use</li>
            <li> Since it was cheap and both Ionic and Ceramic, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I had to hold the hair on the brush with my free hand which defeats the purpose of having an all-in-one dryer.  </li>
            <li> The ceramic is nice because it heats up fast and evenly, styling products also don&#x27;t seem to stick or stain.  </li>
            <li> When I leave there, I look fabulous</li>
            <li> My hair styles are sleek and smooth -- no frizz anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I still own an older model</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are pretty soft and I think someone with longer and/or thicker hair would not be as happy with this model as I am.</li>
            <li> It has a unique system that can be adjusted according to hair-type - for instance</li>
            <li> I have never owned a hot air brush dryer before, but I am so glad that I tried it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the blower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> A bit noisy, but definately worth it!</li>
            <li> Small sacrifice for salon beautiful hair!    </li>
            <li> However, for my mother, who has very thick and healthy hair, it worked perfectly for her.  </li>
            <li> Handle too big to hold well and too powerful, makes hair fly.  </li>
            <li> I loved the way it saved time by drying and styling my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> I had a similar blower for years, which I loved, but its power was rather anemic.  </li>
            <li> My very processed hair looks healthy and shiny after using this brush.  </li>
            <li> Roll the hair in, turn on the hot air, then the cool air, and you&#x27;ve got body and style!  </li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S PINK MY FAVORITE COLOR!!</li>
            <li> From the reviews I&#x27;ve read though, they all seam to die relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> to change attachments quickly.</li>
            <li> i have very straight hair, so it doesnt make as huge a difference on my hair as on my friends&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> when using heat to style it and this tool still toasted my hair--it gets VERY VERY hot.       </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased and thinking of getting another to hold on to keep</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT VERY MUCH!</li>
            <li> I can achieve great result in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; dries hair fast.  </li>
            <li> The second set seems to work fine, and do all that it is supposed to do, however, I can not seem to figure out what it is suposed to do. :-)</li>
            <li> I have used hot air brushes before, and I prefer them to separate hair dryers and brushes, but this one is much better than my older ones.  </li>
            <li> and I never did like how the picture showed a girl with perfect curls that for my type of hair (very thick)</li>
            <li> The Revlon on the other hand was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> I think my hair is stubborn because it doesn&#x27;t do well with a straight iron either, but I just might be buying cheap products.</li>
            <li> and my hair is silky, shiny, straight, wavy, and gorgeous (for the next 2 days!).</li>
            <li> Feel like I got my monies worth and would order again from this company.</li>
            <li> But this is no big deal, great for frequent traveler in a rush.</li>
            <li> They have told several people how much they loved it and their friends are also buying it.  </li>
            <li> This tool is a powerful styling tool.</li>
            <li> I use it on my very curly hair, to get it more straight</li>
            <li> This was well worth the money</li>
            <li> This is even BETTER than my old one (also Revlon).  </li>
            <li> I liked it enough to order another one.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful hair dryer, brush combo.</li>
            <li> It heats up well, and is extremely loud like many others have reviewed.</li>
            <li> This one is great for smoothing out my hair because it has the ion feature....but only drawback is that it is too loud.</li>
            <li> It will seem ackward at first (if you are used to using brush and blow dryer) but get used to it quickly.    </li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift, the first one i bought didn&#x27;t work at all, however i returned it, and got a replacement really quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable ionic setting (I have long, fine hair and use the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting)so you don&#x27;t \\&quot;overdo\\&quot; the ions.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, salon blow dry right at your house and FREE!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I am not a pink person, and this was the least attractive of the group but the performance makes up for</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the advise of a friend and was she right.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t get it right.      </li>
            <li> Apparently it works faster and better than a hair dryer with a separate brush.</li>
            <li> It really does seem to help give my hair a bit more boost and lift than my old brush.  </li>
            <li> Finally found it for my sister here on Amazon for considerably more than I paid, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> It shapes my hair exactly as I tell it to in exactly the right spots.  </li>
            <li> This product works very fast and I like how my hair looks after I&#x27;ve used it.    </li>
            <li> the barrel gets really hot, so it acts as a curling iron as well.  </li>
            <li> I have duct taped the brush cylinder to the dryer but the metal areas get too hot for the tape to adhere.  </li>
            <li> I might return it for that reason, even though it did the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> You can not hold on the end to help hold it because it is to hot.</li>
            <li> provides a much more consistent heat, which is a big improvement to avoid spot overheating.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first one in November of 2008 at Walmart.</li>
            <li> and I used products, but I couldn&#x27;t get this hot air brush to curl my hair under or flipped out.</li>
            <li> is that you can&#x27;t hold the tip of the brush attachments because they get too hot.  </li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t take care of all the fly aways especially small hair at the top of the head that stand up wierd due to static.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have been using one for years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> IT is good quality and will cut down your styling time in half, LOVE this.  </li>
            <li> I would have paid a bit extra to have an \\&quot;easy cleaning\\&quot; feature on this.  </li>
            <li> The Revlon hairdrier I purchased has certainly exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to loose any more of my hearing.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thinning and this gives it just enough oomph.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this kit as a replacement for an older Revlon Hot Air styler.  </li>
            <li> The high setting gets really hot and so does the brush area.</li>
            <li> It left her hair smooth (but her hair doesnt see much chemicals or product like mine.)</li>
            <li> My hair turns frizzy to smooth and under total control all day until washing again with this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter was visiting and now she wants one.</li>
            <li> I have very bushy hair and this tool takes all the frizz out.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer works very well.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> The lower setting is much quieter.  </li>
            <li> It dries and styles my hair much faster.  </li>
            <li> You really should wear ear plugs to protect your hearing.  </li>
            <li> Hair type: medium in thickness, very abused (colored, bleached, permed, relaxed, you name it</li>
            <li> Cons:    made my hair very \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; looking, didnt get rid of much frizz,</li>
            <li> IT MUCH EASIER THEN HOLDING A BLOWER IN ONE HAND AND</li>
            <li> I guess because I didn&#x27;t have to worry about coordination so much.     </li>
            <li> either straight, waves or curls.  </li>
            <li> I have used Conair hot air brushes and liked them, but I couldn&#x27;t find one with a 1\\&quot; bristled barrel for my growing but not yet long enough for a 1.25\\&quot; diameter barrel hair.</li>
            <li> I have a huge plastic tub full of similar hair dryers because I couldn&#x27;t find the same one</li>
            <li> I use it daily on my bangs and they look great, no more flat-looking bangs.</li>
            <li> really only use the smaller brush (I&#x27;ve owned three, and the original one I bought came with a straightener/curling iron attachment, which was cool,</li>
            <li> This new pink one is nicer, came with more gadgets and is made stronger.</li>
            <li> It really adds shine and is simple and quick to use.</li>
            <li> The barrel gets VERY VERY HOT whether using low or high air flow!      </li>
            <li> In March, 2008, the heating element stopped working and only cool air came out, so I exchanged it for another one.</li>
            <li> I keep it on low, as the sound is very loud when on high.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely no good at blowing out my own fine hair with a brush and regular hairblower.  </li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the ion and ceramic features which my older model did not have.  </li>
            <li> As with my older model, the attachments sometimes do not stay attached.  </li>
            <li> I have used older models of the Revlon Air Brush for many years, usually using a blow dryer first.  </li>
            <li> I like the bristles and heat/power settings on this particular model, so</li>
            <li> Also, it is a little bigger(taller) in size than I expected,so doesn&#x27;t fit in the place I designated for it, but easily fits in the pull out drawer next to the sink.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I looked and researched other hot air brushes before I bought it, and with 1200 watts, it definitely had more power than others.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who wants their hair to be shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair stays shiny and soft the whole day</li>
            <li> It is so much better than using a round brush and blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off with a round brush and blowdryer.</li>
            <li> Two weeks ago after an expensive cut and color, I was ready to cry over my many sad attempts at recreating the artistic rendition my stylist provided of my now beautiful cut and color.      </li>
            <li> I normally use the larger brush for overall fullness, but the smaller brush works great to create more dramatic spirals and waves in my hair when i feel the urge.  </li>
            <li> This is the first Air Brush of any brand I have ever used that I do not need to dry my hair first.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have too much adjustability on the heat setting (just low and high), but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  </li>
            <li> My hair is wavy to the point of nearly curly, and I used this tool to blow it straight with Organix hair serum, and the results were straighter and nice than with a regular and round brush.</li>
            <li> The hair waving against the scalp made it hard to reach with drier and straight iron, but with the revlon hot air brush, I have a free hand to pull the hair away from my scalp.</li>
            <li> but I hope they can send me a new one.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I went shopping for a new gizmo or gadget that just might work.</li>
            <li> Although it does a good-enough job, I dislike it intensely because 1) the air flow is much too intense, 2) it is far too noisy, 3) low heat setting isn&#x27;t hot enough but medium</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, although there is a slight lurning curve.</li>
            <li> For me this is far easier and gives better results than trying to use a round brush with a separate hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because it&#x27;s so loud and doesn&#x27;t seem to be much more than a hair dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> If you ask me, the only improvement this kit should have had may be a compact storage case to match the Hot Air Kit for travel.</li>
            <li> This is the second hot brush I have purchased from Revlon aka Helen of Troy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been serching for a while for a hot air brush to replace my last one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this tool, as it is so much easier to use than a regular drier and round brush.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace an old ionic hot air brush I had that knonked out finally.  </li>
            <li> I look salon fresh every single time I use it.      </li>
            <li> Ifeel really happy - nothing gets one down more than a bad hair day</li>
            <li> The cold shot works great to set my style.</li>
            <li> I find it much easier than blow drying with a regular hair dryer and brush and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> And naturally... I can&#x27;t find another one anywhere.</li>
            <li> However, it is so loud that I cannot bear to use it.</li>
            <li> This one did work like a dream, but i just COULD NOT take how loud it was...</li>
            <li> The soft vinyl head does NOT burn my hair.  </li>
            <li> that the old one I bought for about $[...].  </li>
            <li> and it just stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li> You can direct the heat where you want it without your hair flying everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s convenient and that I only need to use one hand.  </li>
            <li> I have a professional version of this which I use at our home in Asia.  </li>
            <li> The drier is powerful and my hair dried much quicker.</li>
            <li> Could use better bristles for holding thick hair.</li>
            <li> It looks cute, is really convenient to have, but is a poor investment.  </li>
            <li> til it&#x27;s all dry and pretty.</li>
            <li> Overall, I woudl say it is a decent product.</li>
            <li> This type of loose bristle brush is also much better than the plastic teeth or tight bristle &#x27;brush&#x27; types.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 62 years young (she really does not look like she&#x27;s 62) and doesnt have any issues handling this, and not having to blow dry her hair with one hand and</li>
            <li> My hair is long, straight and has layers</li>
            <li> As others have observed, the dryer is loud on the highest setting because it is powerful, so you might want to stuff a little cotton in your ears before drying.  </li>
            <li> You do have to get used to doing you hair with this product, I would suggest parting your hair in sections and MAKE sure you hair is damp not dripping wet!, less product you have in your hair</li>
            <li> I really like the capacity to dry and curl and having two sizes of brushes</li>
            <li> The one time I really needed to blow dry my hair, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.  </li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this product, simply because my old one just died on me after 2 years of use!!!</li>
            <li> With this tool, I can have gorgeous hair in about 10 mins (sometimes, I let it dry a little, naturally, then it only takes 5 mins \\&quot;under the dryer\\&quot; and less stress on my hair).</li>
            <li> Unlike some kits which come with tons of attachments, and I could only use half but paid the wholet kit in full.  </li>
            <li> My hair is med - fine texture and on the thick side</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the brush doesn&#x27;t hold my hair very easily since my hair is too thin and doesn&#x27;t catch in the bristles.</li>
            <li> I have thin straight hair and it gives a nice fluffiness and a little volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> and general quality- flimsy bristles that didn&#x27;t hold the hair and than fell out.  </li>
            <li> It smoothed and styled my bleach blonde tresses as well as my professional equipment.</li>
            <li> I am fast, but not fast enough.  </li>
            <li> and I can actually blow dry my hair every morning without getting up too early !!</li>
            <li> It is louder and the barrel is a little bigger, but the power, heavy ceramic coating, and quality bristles (firmer and well attached) more than made up for it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no doubt fine for long, thick hair; mine is ear-length, thin and fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried buying every round brush, flat iron, curling iron, hot air brush and even a waving iron to attempt somewhat similar results.  </li>
            <li> I spotted this little number and opted to try it, but swore it would be my absolute last styling gadget.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and blonde, and the air brush gives me easy lift and body that is impossible to get with curling irons or rollers of any kind.</li>
            <li> One down side woudl be that it is very loud.</li>
            <li> Now, on May 15, 2008, less than 2 months later, the \\&quot;High\\&quot; setting stopped working completely, after I started smelling smoke!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hate:&lt;br /&gt;Handle too large for my small</li>
            <li> The loose bristle brushes hold your air tightly to the barrel while leaving lots of space for the hot air to dry it and the barrel to shape it.  </li>
            <li> If you hair is frizz prone, you might have to run the flat iron through it...</li>
            <li> I had no talent using a brush and dryer at the same time, but have no problem using one of these to blow out my long hair-</li>
            <li> It dried my hair pretty quickly (fine hair, shorter than shoulder) but after I was done, my left ear had that slightly numb feeling I used to get after I&#x27;d been at a dance club all night.</li>
            <li> Since you are pulling it through your hair, it also makes the cuticle lay down which gives your hair that soft shiny look.  </li>
            <li> But apparently NOT this one!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased expensive ones, cheap ones, moderately priced ones.  </li>
            <li> My complaints are that is is extremely loud (like having a 747 blowing in your ear) and the very tip of it is a little too small.  </li>
            <li> It is a little loud, but that doesnt bother me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only 1200W, so if I&#x27;m REALLY in a hurry, I flip my head over and dry my sopping wet hair for a few mins with a bigger dryer, til it&#x27;s damp and not dripping, THEN, I plug in this one (head still flipped over) and brush from root to end, curling the ends back up to the root, holding it here for a few secs to \\&quot;set\\&quot; the curl, all over my head, over and over again</li>
            <li> I can simply brush and dry while I read my morning email, and my hair is full-bodied and shiny all day.    </li>
            <li> It can dry my long hair in just 4-5 minutes;</li>
            <li> No blowdryer in one hand and brush in the other anymore, for my medium hair, it only takes 5 minutes each side from tip to end to blow dry and avoid flyaway,</li>
            <li> I do have to air dry my hair for a bit OR dry it a bit before using the brush.    </li>
            <li> Use it all the time  even when hair is dry, just to give my hair some body.</li>
            <li> With the light pink exterior and at this price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> so I used to air dry.  </li>
            <li> It even works for touch-ups to dry hair, like after I&#x27;ve been out in humidity</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried straightening irons, regular blow dryers, all sorts of flat and round brushes, and even other curling brush dryer things and this is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve found that, EVERY TIME I use it, I get compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried straightening irons, regular blow dryers, all sorts of flat and round brushes, and even other curling brush dryer things and this is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve found that, EVERY TIME I use it, I get compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> It cut my hair time in half if not more and my hair had body all day unlike when I have to blow dry straight, then curl the ends and then straighten fuzzy flyaways at the roots.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a faster way to straighten and style my hair than the old fashion round brush and blow dryer and found it!    </li>
            <li> but over all I will always use this type of dryer, just not this one which makes me sad because compared to other models and brands this one is really sturdy, ...just too loud!..</li>
            <li> gets a little hot...and air blows pretty hard on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x60;t afford to loose any hair.</li>
            <li> I thought the cord may be loose, so I stopped running it through my hair to have a look.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine ever going back to juggling my hairbrush in one hand and the hair dryer in the other!</li>
            <li> the faster it will dry!</li>
            <li> Mine finally shorted out out after many years of every day use. :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it stopped blowing hot hair after about 5 weeks of regular use.  </li>
            <li> Should have paid closer attention to previous reviews - I have the same problems.  </li>
            <li> It takes half the time, with low heat.</li>
            <li> I have very dry brittle hair with tendency to curl</li>
            <li> It takes me over an hour to blow dry it regulary with a traditional blow dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li> setting burns my scalp and ears, and 4) overall size is large and difficult to handle.</li>
            <li> It is everything that I expected.  </li>
            <li> With this model, I can get practically the same result that my stylist achieves when I get my hair cut and blown out every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I never really understood what \\&quot;Ionic\\&quot; was all about, but now I do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bristles too soft to brush through my thick hair</li>
            <li> Due to health problems have to wash and style below shoulder length hair whilst in bed.  </li>
            <li> so I use the bigger curler because the small one gets stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I like to hold the end with my other hand while brushing it through my hair...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that the barrel is too big (and I have small hands).</li>
            <li> As in louder then any other blow-dryer i have owned.</li>
            <li> The ceramic really (no really!)</li>
            <li> a brush in the other is a bonus for her.    </li>
            <li> No longer need 2 hands to blow dry your hair - one holding the round brush and the other the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> its just not real easy to hold</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that it is going to be difficult to clean the filter on this brush.  </li>
            <li> I only have one complant the end of the brush is hard to hold with out burning your hand/fingers.  </li>
            <li> High, low and cold.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cord.</li>
            <li> I found others had the same complaint after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Haha.  Lame.</li>
            <li> My only complaint...</li>
            <li> Not worrying about coordination allowed me to get in closer to my scalp where the hair waves down across my scalp, as described about type 2 hairs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to use any \\&quot;product\\&quot; on my hair (other than a little leave-in conditioner)</li>
            <li> I tried the Wigo Ceramic Brush but the bristles folded down when styling at the slightest pressure and I also tried the BaByliss Pro 2\\&quot; ceramic ionic brush which oddly sucked hair into the intake vents while drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I have had this dryer less than a year.  </li>
            <li> I have a blow dryer from 8-10 years ago (that cost ALOT less) that still works.</li>
            <li> I owned the previous Revlon like this</li>
            <li> (it came in black) but</li>
            <li> The tip gets really hot, which makes it really awkward to turn and my ears ring when I am finished.  </li>
            <li> I just emailed Helen of Troy about this mess of a product.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair</li>
            <li> I was used to one that the end was a little knob like to hold on too</li>
            <li> but this little baby handled everything in it&#x27;s stride</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a recurring problem with other users.  </li>
            <li> I had bought two other brands (a conair and Vidal Sassoon) and was disappointed with the power and heat (despite the higher wattage!)</li>
            <li> A little hair serum takes care of that though.</li>
            <li> THE BRUSH ON THE OTHER!!</li>
            <li> I like how slim the dryer and the narrow tip.  </li>
            <li> The handle is too fat and heavy.</li>
            <li> I got this product for xmas yesterday and within a few minutes the clippie thing that holds the brush on broke however I am still giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> After 30 min of running it through my hair, my hair just looked like I had blow dried it without any style.</li>
            <li> However, if I choose to give my ends a little curl, I will use the small one.</li>
            <li> I hate doing my hair, and to blow dry while holding a brush takes too much effort for me.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several but after few years unfortunately, they die.  </li>
            <li> No static, no burning, no \\&quot;product\\&quot;, no stress, no fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few years ago and VIOLA!</li>
            <li> no more flipping outward for my end either.</li>
            <li> The small tip that snaps the brush into place broke off.  </li>
            <li> I am now looking to replace the dryer and not sure what to go to.</li>
            <li> but with the tip being so small, I often burn my finger.    </li>
            <li> Not sure why that is.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if I should buy this again or go with another brand.  </li>
            <li> When I went to use it this morning, it started randomly shutting off and coming back on.</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m getting my third because the plastic catch that holds the attachment (brush or air) fails.  </li>
            <li> I used it very carefully with the broken button</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to my double process blonde clients as well as my sister for home styling, but it is impossible to find!  </li>
            <li> I bought this product a year ago and hardly used it</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time getting the bristles to grab my hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes it hard to keep the hair around the brush.</li>
            <li> My hair has these waves in the back that drive me crazy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least a couple years now with no problems or complaints.</li>
            <li> I have thick layered wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and I expect no more frizzies!  </li>
            <li> but I threw it out, thinking it was useless, when the first one broke :(  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Without this tool, I look like a forest-dweller with distractingly thin, stringy, dull, lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> and I found it close to impossible to get the brush to \\&quot;stay\\&quot; in my hair in order for it to style and dry.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed the last time I took the brush dryer with me on a trip.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a little wavy sometimes, but generally looks horrible when I just let it go</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder lenght, and thin.</li>
            <li> it broken (the brush part kept popping out).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didnt work for me.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it won&#x27;t work on our yearly trips home to the US, even with the power converter.  </li>
            <li> the product is virtually useless.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> and I guess lack of styling skills was impossible for me to ever achieve with this product.  </li>
            <li> had this item 6 months, it begin to smell of burnt plastic really bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> (bad decision -</li>
            <li> (wouldn&#x27;t turn on) :(</li>
            <li> I knew Amazon would have some, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> so you have to hold it from the base when using it to prevent this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a like hate relationship with this</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have a huge plastic tub full of similar hair dryers because I couldn&#x27;t find the same one anywhere so tried them all, hoping to have same results. No such luck and no idea why this one exceeds them all but it just does. My hair turns frizzy to smooth and under total control all day until washing again with this product. And naturally... I can&#x27;t find another one anywhere. Mine finally shorted out out after many years of every day use. :(</li>
            <li> I was looking for a faster way to straighten and style my hair than the old fashion round brush and blow dryer and found it!    The ion feature on this dries my hair in seconds. It is easy to use, although there is a slight lurning curve. It will seem ackward at first (if you are used to using brush and blow dryer) but get used to it quickly.    IT is good quality and will cut down your styling time in half, LOVE this.  My only complaint is the cord. It gets wrapped up on the handle sometimes so you have to hold it from the base when using it to prevent this.</li>
            <li> USE:&lt;br /&gt;I really only use the smaller brush (I&#x27;ve owned three, and the original one I bought came with a straightener/curling iron attachment, which was cool, but I threw it out, thinking it was useless, when the first one broke :(  It&#x27;s only 1200W, so if I&#x27;m REALLY in a hurry, I flip my head over and dry my sopping wet hair for a few mins with a bigger dryer, til it&#x27;s damp and not dripping, THEN, I plug in this one (head still flipped over) and brush from root to end, curling the ends back up to the root, holding it here for a few secs to \\&quot;set\\&quot; the curl, all over my head, over and over again til it&#x27;s all dry and pretty. No static, no burning, no \\&quot;product\\&quot;, no stress, no fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXPERIENCE:&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT a style-oriented person, I was never taught how to style my hair, and for many, many years, I wore it up in a bun, or scrunchie, or pig/ponytails cause I just didn&#x27;t know what to do with it. I bought one of these a few years ago and VIOLA! I knew what to do with my hair! (angelic singing in background...). I have shoulder-length, fine hair, that&#x27;s a little wavy sometimes, but generally looks horrible when I just let it go it&#x27;s own way. With this tool, I can have gorgeous hair in about 10 mins (sometimes, I let it dry a little, naturally, then it only takes 5 mins \\&quot;under the dryer\\&quot; and less stress on my hair). I don&#x27;t even need to use any \\&quot;product\\&quot; on my hair (other than a little leave-in conditioner) and my hair is silky, shiny, straight, wavy, and gorgeous (for the next 2 days!). Without this tool, I look like a forest-dweller with distractingly thin, stringy, dull, lifeless hair. Seriously. This styler even makes my hair look thicker and healthier! I hope it comes back in stock soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DURABILITY:&lt;br /&gt;I used it successfully (and fairly gently) for about 9 months then it broke (wouldn&#x27;t turn on) :( I immediately ran out and bought another one, and my hair was pretty, shiny, wavy, silky and beautiful again. 9 months later, that one broke, too. (turned on and sparks started coming from engine compartment) Ugh! I bought a third one, used it for almost two years, and whaddya-know...broke again (this time, the latch that holds the attachments on, broke off) - agghhh! I&#x27;ve tried straightening irons, regular blow dryers, all sorts of flat and round brushes, and even other curling brush dryer things and this is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve found that, EVERY TIME I use it, I get compliments on my hair. Easy, Breezy! Now, it&#x27;s out of stock - what am I going to do???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STARS:&lt;br /&gt;Five Stars for: effectiveness, portability (easy to pack), and making me look pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Minus a Star for: breaks too often, and I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;pink\\&quot; person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rely on reviews here at Amazon, to help me make informed buying choices.

            <li> I bought this item to replace my styling brush plus hair dryer. However, it is so loud that I cannot bear to use it. Aside from that it is okey.</li>
            <li> This was not for me.  Handle too big to hold well and too powerful, makes hair fly.  I prefer the Helen of Troy smaller one.</li>
            <li> It is everything that I expected.  It arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I have a chin length bob! My hair is fine, but I have lots of it.  This has simplified my morning routine.  Curls hair under perfectly and great for adding volume on top. Also works well to creat a flip on the ends.      Downside- Noisy! I do have to air dry my hair for a bit OR dry it a bit before using the brush.    Upside - Adds lots of volume and my hair seems smoother and shinier.  It&#x27;s great because I travel frequently. No hair dryer, brush and curling iron to haul around.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair hot air brushes and liked them, but I couldn&#x27;t find one with a 1\\&quot; bristled barrel for my growing but not yet long enough for a 1.25\\&quot; diameter barrel hair. I settled on this Revlon model because it has the features I want. After using it five times, I am looking for a replacement so I can throw it away. Although it does a good-enough job, I dislike it intensely because 1) the air flow is much too intense, 2) it is far too noisy, 3) low heat setting isn&#x27;t hot enough but medium setting burns my scalp and ears, and 4) overall size is large and difficult to handle. It&#x27;s no doubt fine for long, thick hair; mine is ear-length, thin and fine.</li>
            <li> had this item 6 months, it begin to smell of burnt plastic really bad. we threw it  alway.</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of hair dryer since i was 15, I could never get the brush and blow dryer thing going. I am now 29, and have went though many. This one did work like a dream, but i just COULD NOT take how loud it was... I used it 2x and then I had to return it. It gives you great body. I still own an older model and I use that one. These usally last about 1yr on my hair.You do have to get used to doing you hair with this product, I would suggest parting your hair in sections and MAKE sure you hair is damp not dripping wet!, less product you have in your hair the faster it will dry! If you hair is frizz prone, you might have to run the flat iron through it...but over all I will always use this type of dryer, just not this one which makes me sad because compared to other models and brands this one is really sturdy, ...just too loud!..</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Received it in perfect condition and when it dies will order another one.  I have owned several but after few years unfortunately, they die.  Feel like I got my monies worth and would order again from this company.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice dryer styler.  I only have one complant the end of the brush is hard to hold with out burning your hand/fingers.  I was used to one that the end was a little knob like to hold on too and this one has a end its just not real easy to hold and therefore i burn my fingers.  Im trying to figure a way not to do that tho.  Other wise its great!! My daughter was visiting and now she wants one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair styling tool at WalMart.    I was very excited about this purchase and thought I loved the product when I first brought it home. However, the heat is NOT adjustable. The blower can be turned to low, but the heat can&#x27;t be adjusted unless you use the air only setting which defeats the purpose of this tool.  The barrel gets VERY VERY HOT whether using low or high air flow!      I am fast, but not fast enough.  The metal TOASTS my blond hair.  It has actually turned my hair a darker shade and damaged my hair! While the damage did not all occur after one use, daily use has had a cumulative effect. Yes, I do use a protectant on my hair when using heat to style it and this tool still toasted my hair--it gets VERY VERY hot.       A BETTER product is the Helen of Troy air brush.  The soft vinyl head does NOT burn my hair.  Of course, I still try to be judicious about the use of any heated hair styling tools.     I also recommend Caruso hair setting systems for maximum curl without hair damage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the advise of a friend and was she right. I have very bushy hair and this tool takes all the frizz out.  I love it.  Use it all the time  even when hair is dry, just to give my hair some body.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this product! i have very straight hair, so it doesnt make as huge a difference on my hair as on my friends&#x27; hair. But its greeat for me for volume, finishing, shine etc. But ive used it on my girlfreinds and it ccreates the most perfect blow out ever. the barrel gets really hot, so it acts as a curling iron as well.  cant recommend this enough!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works very well.  It has two brushes and a drying attachment.  My hair has these waves in the back that drive me crazy.  This hairdryer straightens them perfectly with large curl for some body.  It also has three settings.  High, low and cold.  For the price, it is a great item.</li>
            <li> Due to health problems have to wash and style below shoulder length hair whilst in bed.  i received my Revlon kit and couple of days ago and used yesterday.  Oh my goodness.  What a treat.  I did not have to grapel with separate hair drier and brush.  The drier is powerful and my hair dried much quicker. I have very dry brittle hair with tendency to curl but this little baby handled everything in it&#x27;s stride and I have smooth hair turned under at the ends.  Even my hubby complimented me on the result. Ifeel really happy - nothing gets one down more than a bad hair day and I expect no more frizzies!  Bliss Great product - reasonable price - try it!</li>
            <li> No blowdryer in one hand and brush in the other anymore, for my medium hair, it only takes 5 minutes each side from tip to end to blow dry and avoid flyaway, no more flipping outward for my end either. And it only comes with 2 attachments, so I can utilize the entire kit for what I paid for.  Unlike some kits which come with tons of attachments, and I could only use half but paid the wholet kit in full.  With the light pink exterior and at this price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it. If you ask me, the only improvement this kit should have had may be a compact storage case to match the Hot Air Kit for travel. But this is no big deal, great for frequent traveler in a rush.</li>
            <li> I really like the capacity to dry and curl and having two sizes of brushes is a bonus.  Having the cool setting is very nice.  The high setting gets really hot and so does the brush area. I was disappointed the last time I took the brush dryer with me on a trip.  The small tip that snaps the brush into place broke off.  I have carpeted floor in my bath and bedroom, so if the dryer was dropped it dropped onto a carpeted floor.  Anyway, I have had this dryer less than a year.  Not sure if this is a recurring problem with other users.  I have duct taped the brush cylinder to the dryer but the metal areas get too hot for the tape to adhere.  I am now looking to replace the dryer and not sure what to go to.</li>
            <li> The Revlon hairdrier I purchased has certainly exceeded my expectations.  It has a unique system that can be adjusted according to hair-type - for instance, I have fine hair so the switch adjusts the drier to ensuring that my hair does not over-dry out causing it to go frizzy or electric.  I get much more volume in my hair and the style remains throughout the day and does not fall out - which is a first!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for myself. I loved the way it saved time by drying and styling my hair at the same time. It left my hair smooth and shiny. I loved it so much I bought one for my daughter and daughter-in-law.  They have told several people how much they loved it and their friends are also buying it.  I highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this product, simply because my old one just died on me after 2 years of use!!! I would recommend this for anyone who wants their hair to be shiny and soft. The length of my hair is to the middle of my back so I use the bigger curler because the small one gets stuck in my hair. However, if I choose to give my ends a little curl, I will use the small one. Overall, the product is great and Amazon seems to have the best price right now at $27 with shipping. Buy it - you will love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have never owned a hot air brush dryer before, but I am so glad that I tried it. I find it much easier than blow drying with a regular hair dryer and brush and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. I looked around before buying this model and settled on this one because it had both a brush and curling/straightening attachment.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s pretty easy to use. I had to use two hands just to roll it because it was kind of large for my hand. It dried my hair pretty quickly (fine hair, shorter than shoulder) but after I was done, my left ear had that slightly numb feeling I used to get after I&#x27;d been at a dance club all night. I might return it for that reason, even though it did the job pretty well. I can&#x27;t afford to loose any more of my hearing. Those extra watts come with a price.</li>
            <li> I had a similar blower for years, which I loved, but its power was rather anemic.  This 1200w model dries quickly and styles nicely.  I am absolutely no good at blowing out my own fine hair with a brush and regular hairblower.  With this model, I can get practically the same result that my stylist achieves when I get my hair cut and blown out every few weeks.  The bristles don&#x27;t snag my hair, and I don&#x27;t feel I am damaging my hair as I seemed to be doing with a ceramic curling iron.  As others have observed, the dryer is loud on the highest setting because it is powerful, so you might want to stuff a little cotton in your ears before drying.  The lower setting is much quieter.  Love this dryer/styler -- I&#x27;m planning to send one to my sister for her birthday.</li>
            <li> This product works very fast and I like how my hair looks after I&#x27;ve used it.    My complaints are that is is extremely loud (like having a 747 blowing in your ear) and the very tip of it is a little too small.  Sometimes I like to hold the end with my other hand while brushing it through my hair...but with the tip being so small, I often burn my finger.    But, this two complaints can be worked around</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thinning and this gives it just enough oomph.  I&#x27;ve been using this for at least a couple years now with no problems or complaints.</li>
            <li> This tool is a powerful styling tool. It can dry my long hair in just 4-5 minutes; What a time-saver! Great quality product and so affordable too.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on 6/24/08.  On 7/28/08 the heating element died.  This is the second hot brush I have purchased from Revlon aka Helen of Troy.  I think it&#x27;s the last one.</li>
            <li> Liked the color. Easy to use &amp; dries hair fast.  Could use better bristles for holding thick hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit as a replacement for an older Revlon Hot Air styler.  I was intrigued by the ion and ceramic features which my older model did not have.  As with my older model, the attachments sometimes do not stay attached.  I wish Revlon would come up with a better design for the attachments.  Besides that, the styler works well.  I have shoulder length curly/wavy hair and sometimes I want it straighter with some body.  The Revlon RV446 does the trick.  I can achieve great result in less than 10 minutes.  I keep it on low, as the sound is very loud when on high.  I don&#x27;t find that the barrel is too big (and I have small hands).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of these brush-type dryers for several years, and it finally bit the dust a couple of weeks ago.  I couldn&#x27;t find ANY of this type of brush dryer in my local stores (including WalMart, Walgreens and Meijer).  I knew Amazon would have some, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  I was going to get one of the cheaper models, but decided on this Revlon 1200W Ion one, just because of the good reviews posted.  And I&#x27;m glad I did.  For an extra [...] bucks or so, which got me free shipping, I got a much more superior product that the old one I bought for about $[...].  I am so impressed with this dryer.  It&#x27;s sturdy and drys my hair faster and gives it more body and shine.  I hope Revlon doesn&#x27;t phase this type of dryer out, as I love it.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift, the first one i bought didn&#x27;t work at all, however i returned it, and got a replacement really quickly. The second set seems to work fine, and do all that it is supposed to do, however, I can not seem to figure out what it is suposed to do. :-) One down side woudl be that it is very loud. As in louder then any other blow-dryer i have owned. Not sure why that is. Overall, I woudl say it is a decent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been serching for a while for a hot air brush to replace my last one.  I tried the Wigo Ceramic Brush but the bristles folded down when styling at the slightest pressure and I also tried the BaByliss Pro 2\\&quot; ceramic ionic brush which oddly sucked hair into the intake vents while drying your hair.  Ouch!  Too bad I found others had the same complaint after I bought it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This dryer works well, dries quickly, and leaves your hair shiny and healthy.  It is comfortable to use and I haven&#x27;t found a thing I don&#x27;t like about it.  Overall I&#x27;m very pleased and thinking of getting another to hold on to keep should this one ever need replacing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  I have used hot air brushes before, and I prefer them to separate hair dryers and brushes, but this one is much better than my older ones.  It dries and styles my hair much faster.  I looked and researched other hot air brushes before I bought it, and with 1200 watts, it definitely had more power than others.  It is a really good product for a really good price!!  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a year ago and hardly used it (I&#x27;m not big on styling my hair, so only used it once or twice a month).  The one time I really needed to blow dry my hair, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.  I hadn&#x27;t used it in about a month and it just stopped working completely.  Reset it, checked my outlets, but it just stopped working.  It looks cute, is really convenient to have, but is a poor investment.  That, and I never did like how the picture showed a girl with perfect curls that for my type of hair (very thick) and I guess lack of styling skills was impossible for me to ever achieve with this product.  My hair would just get tangled up and pull the brushes off the dryer.  Haha.  Lame.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the blower. I use it on my very curly hair, to get it more straight or I should say to get a nice weave. It is a little loud, but that doesnt bother me. It&#x27;s a good price for the product!</li>
            <li> I like how slim the dryer and the narrow tip.  You can direct the heat where you want it without your hair flying everywhere.  One note, the bristles on the brush should be stronger.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is awesome.  It is so much better than using a round brush and blow dryer.  This was well worth the money and I use it instead of a blow dryer now.</li>
            <li> The handle is too fat and heavy. It dries your hair ok. Your hand and arm gets tried. You can not hold on the end to help hold it because it is to hot.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace an old ionic hot air brush I had that knonked out finally.  This is even BETTER than my old one (also Revlon).  My very processed hair looks healthy and shiny after using this brush.  I love the adjustable ionic setting (I have long, fine hair and use the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting)so you don&#x27;t \\&quot;overdo\\&quot; the ions.  It really does seem to help give my hair a bit more boost and lift than my old brush.  The ceramic really (no really!) provides a much more consistent heat, which is a big improvement to avoid spot overheating.  The cold shot works great to set my style. I normally use the larger brush for overall fullness, but the smaller brush works great to create more dramatic spirals and waves in my hair when i feel the urge.  It&#x27;s very light, and the swivel cord keeps it from being cumbersome to use.  It doesn&#x27;t have too much adjustability on the heat setting (just low and high), but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  My only real complaint is that it is going to be difficult to clean the filter on this brush.  I would have paid a bit extra to have an \\&quot;easy cleaning\\&quot; feature on this.  Overall, it&#x27;s a winner.  Very good price, and works great on fine, processed hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and I never used to blow it out because it was a hassle and cumbersome so I used to air dry.  I&#x27;m really glad I got this brush as it made my hair smoother and gave me a more put together look.  Unfortunately it stopped blowing hot hair after about 5 weeks of regular use.  The amazon sellers return policy expired after 30 days.  I haven&#x27;t contacted Revlon yet but I hope they can send me a new one.  I really like that it&#x27;s convenient and that I only need to use one hand.  I guess there is no warranty so I&#x27;m not sure if I should buy this again or go with another brand.  From the reviews I&#x27;ve read though, they all seam to die relatively quickly.  I&#x27;ll probably get another one but if it won&#x27;t last longer this time I&#x27;m switching to a different brand.</li>
            <li> Should have paid closer attention to previous reviews - I have the same problems.  The tip gets really hot, which makes it really awkward to turn and my ears ring when I am finished.  You really should wear ear plugs to protect your hearing.  My hair is med - fine texture and on the thick side and I have a hard time getting the bristles to grab my hair.  I have to push my hair into the brush while turning in order to get it to grip.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder lenght, and thin. Most curling items get caught and tangled in my hair. I can&#x60;t afford to loose any hair. This one does not tangle. and works well. I liked it enough to order another one. This is one of my . GOT TO HAVE ITEMS !</li>
            <li> There many of these types of products on the market today.  But apparently NOT this one!  I am a licensed hairdresser and have scorned these devices for quite some time.  They either fry your hair or do not have any drying/styling power whatsoever.  I stumbled upon this device at a friggin&#x27; Walmart of all places.  Since it was cheap and both Ionic and Ceramic, I decided to give it a try.  It was fabulous!  It smoothed and styled my bleach blonde tresses as well as my professional equipment. I have recommended it to my double process blonde clients as well as my sister for home styling, but it is impossible to find!  Finally found it for my sister here on Amazon for considerably more than I paid, but totally worth it.  Sells for a lot more on ebay!</li>
            <li> I bought that for my friend and she has fine hair and she loves it and calls it a life saver. Apparently it works faster and better than a hair dryer with a separate brush.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this hot air kit.  My hair is long, straight and has layers and I found it close to impossible to get the brush to \\&quot;stay\\&quot; in my hair in order for it to style and dry.  I had to hold the hair on the brush with my free hand which defeats the purpose of having an all-in-one dryer.  I&#x27;m better off with a round brush and blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a like hate relationship with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hate:&lt;br /&gt;Handle too large for my small hands.&lt;br /&gt;Not enough settings for air speed.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles too soft to brush through my thick hair properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like:&lt;br /&gt;Sizes of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Does add shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change attachments quickly.</li>
            <li> I hate doing my hair, and to blow dry while holding a brush takes too much effort for me.  Hence, based on that and the reviews here, I decided to try this product out.    Hair type: medium in thickness, very abused (colored, bleached, permed, relaxed, you name it, my hair has been through it all) chemically altered, damaged hair.    Pros:    Easy to use, lots of heating options, great attachments option with easy off button, gave me more volume at my roots, dries my hair quickly, brush doesn&#x27;t eat my hair.    Cons:    made my hair very \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; looking, didnt get rid of much frizz, can tell with extended use, it would further damage my hair.    This item would have been returned since it did not work for me at all based on the cons, especially since I can tell if I used it often, it would further damage my already abused hair.  Also, no matter how I used it, or what attachments I used, nor what product I used in conjunction with it, I could not get rid of the bigger than life hair look.     However, for my mother, who has very thick and healthy hair, it worked perfectly for her.  It left her hair smooth (but her hair doesnt see much chemicals or product like mine.) and shiny.  She&#x27;s 62 years young (she really does not look like she&#x27;s 62) and doesnt have any issues handling this, and not having to blow dry her hair with one hand and a brush in the other is a bonus for her.    So I guess it depends on what type of hair you have.    Unfortunately, it didnt work for me.  Your welcome ma...can I can a refund from YOU?! lol</li>
            <li> gets a little hot...and air blows pretty hard on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting.  Makes it hard to keep the hair around the brush.</li>
            <li> I just emailed Helen of Troy about this mess of a product. When I first purchased it, I loved it! It was great on my hair and I could finally get a salon look without going to the salon.    I bought my first one in November of 2008 at Walmart. By the end of December, the heating element went out. Exchnged it at the beginning of January. The second one lasted until mid April of 2009, when the heating element went out once again.     I purchased another one yesterday (bad decision - I know). When I went to use it this morning, it started randomly shutting off and coming back on. I thought the cord may be loose, so I stopped running it through my hair to have a look. It was SPARKING on the inside. Thank God, I had taken it out of my hair. I immediatey unplugged it and will be returning it tomorrow.     And to think, I used to like Revlon products....</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT VERY MUCH! IT MUCH EASIER THEN HOLDING A BLOWER IN ONE HAND AND THE BRUSH ON THE OTHER!! ESPECIALLY IT&#x27;S MORE COMPACT TO CARRY WHEN YOU TRAVEL!! BESIDES IT&#x27;S PINK MY FAVORITE COLOR!!</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and found that after using it for a while my hair started breaking.</li>
            <li> Of all the brush blow dryers I have owned (mostly conair over the past 20 years) this is the best. It takes half the time, with low heat. I love it!</li>
            <li> Makes styling hair in the morning--or any time of day a cinch!  Roll the hair in, turn on the hot air, then the cool air, and you&#x27;ve got body and style!  I have had no problems with hair getting caught in the roller.</li>
            <li> For me this is far easier and gives better results than trying to use a round brush with a separate hair dryer. It even works for touch-ups to dry hair, like after I&#x27;ve been out in humidity and I want to get my bangs out of my eyes.    However, I have fine hair, which I wear in a not-quite-shoulder-length layered style. The brush bristles are pretty soft and I think someone with longer and/or thicker hair would not be as happy with this model as I am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this tool, as it is so much easier to use than a regular drier and round brush. The heat that comes out is very hot, and the attachments are great.     Really a great buy. My hair is wavy to the point of nearly curly, and I used this tool to blow it straight with Organix hair serum, and the results were straighter and nice than with a regular and round brush. I guess because I didn&#x27;t have to worry about coordination so much.     Not worrying about coordination allowed me to get in closer to my scalp where the hair waves down across my scalp, as described about type 2 hairs. The hair waving against the scalp made it hard to reach with drier and straight iron, but with the revlon hot air brush, I have a free hand to pull the hair away from my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have a professional version of this which I use at our home in Asia.  Unfortunately it won&#x27;t work on our yearly trips home to the US, even with the power converter.  I had bought two other brands (a conair and Vidal Sassoon) and was disappointed with the power and heat (despite the higher wattage!) and general quality- flimsy bristles that didn&#x27;t hold the hair and than fell out.  The Revlon on the other hand was a pleasant surprise.  It is louder and the barrel is a little bigger, but the power, heavy ceramic coating, and quality bristles (firmer and well attached) more than made up for it.  As a bonus you also get two brushes (1.5\\&quot; and 1\\&quot;) as well as the dryer attachment.  To be honest, I am not a pink person, and this was the least attractive of the group but the performance makes up for it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading this review because you are considering switching to this type of dryer- I highly recommend it.  I had no talent using a brush and dryer at the same time, but have no problem using one of these to blow out my long hair- either straight, waves or curls.  This type of loose bristle brush is also much better than the plastic teeth or tight bristle &#x27;brush&#x27; types.  The loose bristle brushes hold your air tightly to the barrel while leaving lots of space for the hot air to dry it and the barrel to shape it.  The ceramic is nice because it heats up fast and evenly, styling products also don&#x27;t seem to stick or stain.  Since you are pulling it through your hair, it also makes the cuticle lay down which gives your hair that soft shiny look.  The 1.5\\&quot; is best for long hair or to do body.  The 1\\&quot; is good for making curls.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d know about this product years ago. I have thick layered wavy hair. It takes me over an hour to blow dry it regulary with a traditional blow dryer and round brush. This product does it in about 15 minutes! With NO FRIZZ! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this product for xmas yesterday and within a few minutes the clippie thing that holds the brush on broke however I am still giving it 5 stars. I used it very carefully with the broken button and I loved it. It cut my hair time in half if not more and my hair had body all day unlike when I have to blow dry straight, then curl the ends and then straighten fuzzy flyaways at the roots. I can&#x27;t wait to get a new one. It takes away all the fuss of having to hold the dryer and the brush!</li>
            <li> This is a powerful hair dryer, brush combo. It heats up well, and is extremely loud like many others have reviewed. The problem I had, was that it wouldn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to. I have shoulder length hair with layers and I used products, but I couldn&#x27;t get this hot air brush to curl my hair under or flipped out. After 30 min of running it through my hair, my hair just looked like I had blow dried it without any style. I used both attachments, but no luck. Oh, and the attachments popped off once or twice very easily when they shouldn&#x27;t have. I think my hair is stubborn because it doesn&#x27;t do well with a straight iron either, but I just might be buying cheap products. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because it&#x27;s so loud and doesn&#x27;t seem to be much more than a hair dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product !! I cannot imagine ever going back to juggling my hairbrush in one hand and the hair dryer in the other! It really adds shine and is simple and quick to use. I have thin straight hair and it gives a nice fluffiness and a little volume to my hair. My hair stays shiny and soft the whole day and I can actually blow dry my hair every morning without getting up too early !! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the brush doesn&#x27;t hold my hair very easily since my hair is too thin and doesn&#x27;t catch in the bristles. Also, it is a little bigger(taller) in size than I expected,so doesn&#x27;t fit in the place I designated for it, but easily fits in the pull out drawer next to the sink. Also, it doesn&#x27;t take care of all the fly aways especially small hair at the top of the head that stand up wierd due to static.A little hair serum takes care of that though. Otherwise no complaints and a great buy and a great gift!</li>
            <li> great way to style your hair without managing a brush and dryer.  I have long hair and have been using one for years now and love it.  This one is great for smoothing out my hair because it has the ion feature....but only drawback is that it is too loud.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hot air brush. Easy to use, salon blow dry right at your house and FREE! I use it daily on my bangs and they look great, no more flat-looking bangs. Also, I love the fact that I now have no dry/frizzy looking ends and my hair is silky smooth, no fly aways that you get from just a regular hair dryer. A bit noisy, but definately worth it! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought one in November 2007 at Ulta. In March, 2008, the heating element stopped working and only cool air came out, so I exchanged it for another one. Now, on May 15, 2008, less than 2 months later, the \\&quot;High\\&quot; setting stopped working completely, after I started smelling smoke! As of today, I only have a \\&quot;Low\\&quot; setting so the product is virtually useless. I have a blow dryer from 8-10 years ago (that cost ALOT less) that still works. In 6 months, TWO of these Revlon products have stopped working!</li>
            <li> I have used older models of the Revlon Air Brush for many years, usually using a blow dryer first.  This is the first Air Brush of any brand I have ever used that I do not need to dry my hair first.  My hair is thin and blonde, and the air brush gives me easy lift and body that is impossible to get with curling irons or rollers of any kind.</li>
            <li> This works great.  I&#x27;m all thumbs when it comes to styling and this is perfect for me.  I can simply brush and dry while I read my morning email, and my hair is full-bodied and shiny all day.    That said, I&#x27;m getting my third because the plastic catch that holds the attachment (brush or air) fails.  I like the bristles and heat/power settings on this particular model, so I&#x27;ve stuck with it.  It seems to be about a year between replacements.</li>
            <li> For years I have gone to an upscale salon for my cut and color.  When I leave there, I look fabulous but... I can never replicate what the stylist did.  I&#x27;ve watched her diligently.  I&#x27;ve tried buying every round brush, flat iron, curling iron, hot air brush and even a waving iron to attempt somewhat similar results.  I&#x27;ve purchased expensive ones, cheap ones, moderately priced ones.  I&#x27;ve learned to contort my head, arms and hands in ways that they were never meant to bend and move. I&#x27;ve purchased every styling product that comes in a can, a tube, a jar or a vat.  I still can&#x27;t get it right.      Two weeks ago after an expensive cut and color, I was ready to cry over my many sad attempts at recreating the artistic rendition my stylist provided of my now beautiful cut and color.      Out of sheer desperation I went shopping for a new gizmo or gadget that just might work. I spotted this little number and opted to try it, but swore it would be my absolute last styling gadget. Period.  This was it. The hail Mary.      Well, after a dozen uses, I&#x27;ve concluded that this product will definitely be my last styling gadget!  It works!  It shapes my hair exactly as I tell it to in exactly the right spots.  It blow dries my hair while doing so which makes the curls, waves, bends, flattening... whatever... last and last and last.  It&#x27;s simply amazing.  I never really understood what \\&quot;Ionic\\&quot; was all about, but now I do.  My hair styles are sleek and smooth -- no frizz anywhere.  I look salon fresh every single time I use it.      The brushes work effortlessly and don&#x27;t snag or pull.  The concentrator attachment works wonderfully if you still want to contort your body with your favorite round brush.  My only complaint... and it&#x27;s a tiny one... is that you can&#x27;t hold the tip of the brush attachments because they get too hot.  Small sacrifice for salon beautiful hair!    Buy it. You won&#x27;t be sorry.  I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
            <li> No longer need 2 hands to blow dry your hair - one holding the round brush and the other the blow dryer. This is an all in one. Great product. I owned the previous Revlon like this (it came in black) but it broken (the brush part kept popping out). This new pink one is nicer, came with more gadgets and is made stronger. Love it!</li>
