            <li>Overall, an excellent value.</li>
            <li>I love using it whenever I use mineral foundation to set it and to avoid that powdery look.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a scent that I would not describe as enjoyable, but it vanishes within seconds from spraying.</li>
            <li>I am parrticularly satisfied with the primer wich I apply after my daycream and sunskreen.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>

            <li>Primer is awesome, it makes your skin so nice and soft and it really make your makeup stay in place.  </li>
            <li>Smashbox has a pretty good primer.</li>
            <li>I love these products they are really affordable and you get a good amount of product.</li>
            <li>The primer gives you a smooth finish, and the mist does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>I have two other brushes I use for foundation and compared to those, this one is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap &amp; their products are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>has that feather light air brush finish after applying foundation.</li>
            <li>The primer feels so silky and smooth and</li>
            <li>The face primer is good, I wish it would fill in big pores more.  </li>
            <li>I work in healthcare at a hospital in New Jersey and I enjoy looking nice while going to work</li>
            <li>I bought this item recently and the primer is amazing so is the setting spray!</li>
            <li>Not disappointed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a trio like this, well worth the price in my eyes!</li>
            <li>I think this is totally worth it for $6 on the ELF website!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an ELF junkie and the face primer goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and feels nice against my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it, it really works!&lt;br /&gt;Primer, Brush, Makeup mist &amp; set came together</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good value for money.</li>
            <li>Beautiful smooth younger skin instantly !</li>
            <li>Love this product , it really helps keep make up in place, and the stippling brush was a A+ for applying foundation.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t put to much on using it at all.  </li>
            <li>and it smells really fresh..</li>
            <li>to top it off the mist set it in clear completes the look...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s useful.</li>
            <li>I am a busy medical assistant for 12hrs a day, my makeup looks just as good in the evening as it did when i first put it on!</li>
            <li>The brush is not very sturdy but the primer and setting spray are amazing kept my makeup looking fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>but if you buy any little spray bottle from like target it works better!</li>
            <li>This product really helped with the problem I was having.</li>
            <li>The stipple brush is ok, just not very dense -</li>
            <li>I also use just 1 pump/drop for my whole face.</li>
            <li>and I really like them.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and seems to be pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love these products especially for me starting out using foundation !</li>
            <li>This works whether my skin is oilier than normal or whether it&#x27;s drier than normal.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and these products have never made me break out or anything like that.</li>
            <li>The problem with putting on makeup and working in a hospital is that the hospital is very fast paced and you are constantly on the go with patients.  </li>
            <li>While the product may feel a bit greasy during the first few second, it very quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>and it helps my makeup stay in one place and last much longer.</li>
            <li>It does make your face extremely soft.</li>
            <li>The primer is as soft as butter.</li>
            <li>Most primers make my dry skin feel too tight with a mask feel.</li>
            <li>Apparently i&#x27;m allergic to the product.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that the pump did break on me after several uses, but mine was part of the first batch that ELF put on the market and they have improved the pump since (according to their website).</li>

            <li> The brush is decent, but I&#x27;m loosing bristles after only a few days.</li>
            <li> When I usually wear liquid foundation my face gets really glossy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the ELF Mist &amp; Set through extreme heat t and it kept all my makeup in place.</li>
            <li> I took my break and was shocked that my makeup was still fresh.</li>
            <li> It makes my make-up stay where I want it and reduces the likelyhood of uneven powder or concealer.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed that the Infused Face Primer is already empty when I barely used it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure on the setting mist; I&#x27;ve used it, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li> This Primer sucks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with the settings spray I feel like my eyeliner gets off faster</li>
            <li> I prefer setting powder compared to the spray in this kit as it has a slightly sticky texture and adds a sheen (sheen is not ideal for someone with oily skin like me)</li>
            <li> The price makes one skeptical but after pricing other primers which ran anywhere from $15-$50 just for the primer alone, I decided I had nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these products.</li>
            <li> With E.L.F you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

            <li> I love how it came in a week and each one does just as it is described. The primer gives you a smooth finish, and the mist does a pretty good job. I love the brush as well. I have two other brushes I use for foundation and compared to those, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I Love it. They should&#x27;ve thought about this back in the day because I dont recall any of these products may the brush</li>
            <li> When I usually wear liquid foundation my face gets really glossy. This product really helped with the problem I was having. Now, I can use my foundation without constantly wiping my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an ELF junkie and the face primer goes on super smooth. The brush picks up and applies perfectly and the setting spray keeps your makeup on your face all day.</li>
            <li> I love the stipple brush. It makes applying blush easier to manage. The primer is okay but not as good as my Smashbox. I prefer setting powder compared to the spray in this kit as it has a slightly sticky texture and adds a sheen (sheen is not ideal for someone with oily skin like me)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these products especially for me starting out using foundation ! They are very effective of what the purpose of each holds.</li>
            <li> This Primer sucks.  Smashbox has a pretty good primer.</li>
            <li> nice smell makes my skin very silky smooth and smells very good they work perfectly</li>
            <li> I work in healthcare at a hospital in New Jersey and I enjoy looking nice while going to work so I like to put on makeup. The problem with putting on makeup and working in a hospital is that the hospital is very fast paced and you are constantly on the go with patients.  Before getting this I would sweat off my makeup and it would be running off my face by the end of my shift. I put this on once I finish putting  on my makeup before I leave the house I spray my face with this and it helps my makeup stay in one place and last much longer.At the end  of a sixteen hour shift, rolling patients over in bed to examine them, doing vitals,  wound dressings and helping patients get from point A to point B I took my break and was shocked that my makeup was still fresh. Will continue to use this as a  makeup setter. BTW: If you are going to use the spray ( I do) don&#x27;t place the nozzle so close to your face it will make the makeup run spray  at arms length.</li>
            <li> Like the results. Not disappointed.</li>
            <li> ideal set works well, face primer nice and smooth feeling with the stapling brush as well has that feather light air brush finish after applying foundation. to top it off the mist set it in clear completes the look... Great trio, will recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Apparently i&#x27;m allergic to the product. My skin broke out.</li>
            <li> I just started using primer and I do notice the difference in how my makeup goes on. I&#x27;m in my 40s, I have good skin, but I&#x27;m noticing more and more the changes in my skin. This works whether my skin is oilier than normal or whether it&#x27;s drier than normal.  I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> The price makes one skeptical but after pricing other primers which ran anywhere from $15-$50 just for the primer alone, I decided I had nothing to lose.  The primer feels so silky and smooth and the setting mist is awesome because your make-up won&#x27;t move...even after a night of dancing! The brush is very soft and feels nice against my skin. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these products.</li>
            <li> The primer is awesome, so smooth and light weight and the makeup mist is light and dries fast.  The brush is soft and seems to be pretty sturdy.  Great buy, and I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> With E.L.F you can&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s cheap &amp; their products are pretty amazing. The brush isn&#x27;t comparable to more expensive brands but it&#x27;s useful. The finishing spray does the job &amp; the primer is nice as it&#x27;s hydrating. Most primers make my dry skin feel too tight with a mask feel. If you&#x27;re looking for a trio like this, well worth the price in my eyes!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the cleaning mist yet, but I really love the primer. It allows my foundation to go on very smooth. The brush is a nice bonus too. Overall, an excellent value.</li>
            <li> The face primer is good, I wish it would fill in big pores more.  It does make your face extremely soft. Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good value for money.</li>
            <li> I got these products individually off of the ELF website ($3 for the Stipple brush, $6 for the primer and $3 for the Mist &amp; Set).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the ELF Mist &amp; Set through extreme heat t and it kept all my makeup in place. I love using it whenever I use mineral foundation to set it and to avoid that powdery look. I just spray it 3 to 4 times from an arm length away after I&#x27;ve done all my makeup and it works wonders. It has a bit of a scent that I would not describe as enjoyable, but it vanishes within seconds from spraying. I&#x27;ll repurchase this for sure - soon! The stipple brush is ok, just not very dense - I use it for cream blush and liquid highlighter mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ELF primer is said to be a dupe for Smashbox&#x27;s primer (which retails at about $26). It is a silicone-based primer that fills in all the fine lines on your face leaving your skin feeling ultra-silky smooth and ready for a flawless application of foundation. I do notice that when I wear this under my foundation, my skin really looks flawless. I also use just 1 pump/drop for my whole face. While the product may feel a bit greasy during the first few second, it very quickly absorbs into the skin. The only down side is that the pump did break on me after several uses, but mine was part of the first batch that ELF put on the market and they have improved the pump since (according to their website). This did not break me out in any way. I think this is totally worth it for $6 on the ELF website!</li>
            <li> I am parrticularly satisfied with the primer wich I apply after my daycream and sunskreen. It makes my make-up stay where I want it and reduces the likelyhood of uneven powder or concealer. The product itself has a transparent look and a silky feel to the skin. I can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this. Cheops keep my make up from transferring</li>
            <li> I love these products they are really affordable and you get a good amount of product. thanks elf studio for making my skin look flawless!</li>
            <li> Day #3 and i have fallen in love! My makeup stays on all day, no raccoon eyes in the afternoon, stays put all day. I am a busy medical assistant for 12hrs a day, my makeup looks just as good in the evening as it did when i first put it on! Love It, I will purchase more!!</li>
            <li> I love the brush  and primer I&#x27;m not very happy with the settings spray I feel like my eyeliner gets off faster&lt;br /&gt;but everything else is gooD</li>
            <li> The primer feels great but I greasy. The finishing spray is okay. The brush is decent, but I&#x27;m loosing bristles after only a few days.</li>
            <li> The primer is as soft as butter. No use for the brush or spray though</li>
            <li> Love this the primer works great make my skin look great!! And finisher moisten my skin and makes it feel refreshed and my make last forever!!!</li>
            <li> I like these products a lot.  The brand was referred to me and I really like them.</li>
            <li> Amazing! love the primer, so silky and smooth!</li>
