            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I think it has more of a spring/summer floral scent to it.</li>
            <li>Love the perfume, but sprayer broke after 3 squirts.  </li>
            <li>We love coach perfume.</li>
            <li>and I was happy to find the EDP at such a good price.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells.</li>
            <li>but this is in my top 5.</li>
            <li>but I was NOT disappointed when I smelled this one!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and I don&#x27;t know if this is authentic.</li>
            <li>I have never received more compliments on a perfume or cologne than this.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND</li>

            <li>and I am excited I can buy more than one!</li>
            <li>I love the spray.</li>
            <li>It is such a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments when I wear</li>
            <li>ALL TIME FAVORITE SCENTS.</li>
            <li>I even looked it up to make sure.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully someone else experience would be better.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume one of my favorites :)</li>
            <li>I spray it on myself before bed purely for my own enjoyment!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too overpowering or cheap-smelling, and it&#x27;s very clean.</li>
            <li>She loved since the first time she tried it as a sample</li>
            <li>Came in the original box!  </li>
            <li>I found this to be a very light scent which is fine because I do not want something that is over powering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good at lasting too.</li>
            <li>Very sweet smell to me.</li>
            <li>Scent disappears very quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells fruity but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Its not that strong of a smell</li>
            <li>It is perfect, somewhat flora, but not super strong, and a hint of something sensual.</li>
            <li>because it is much cheaper on that website, i love the fragrance, i just wish it would linger longer!</li>
            <li>This smell is very pleasing, very fruity and floral and for the price on here its a great deal.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>And if you can smell your own perfume, ANY perfume, hours after you put it on, you wear TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>And it smells great, she only uses like two sprays a day</li>
            <li>and it was confirmed again when she received the bottle.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s more than enough to smell good.</li>
            <li>I very rarely buy myself perfume because I am so picky.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance from coach, it&#x27;s so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful scent, smells amazing, however it does not last as long as I thought it would but who cares....</li>
            <li>I still had some of my original that I bought a couple of months ago</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Originally got a 1 oz.</li>
            <li>I put it on every day and still am not sick of it.</li>
            <li>it smells good but the bottle and packaging was different than the one i had seen in sephora.</li>
            <li>and this is sweet and flowery.</li>
            <li>I discovered this last year and loved it</li>
            <li>It smells sweet in the bottle and after you spray it on you get citrus and floral.  </li>
            <li>Appears to be the true item.  </li>
            <li>Floral and sweet.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PERFUME.</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh and light.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed it on and absolutely fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not that citric yet not that sweet</li>
            <li>I recommend this one if you do not like super &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; scents, and the purple box if you do prefer a flower scent.</li>
            <li>I feel like it dissipates too quickly, and wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>I always wear D&amp;G Light Blue which is very light and clean smelling</li>
            <li>I now know my new favorite perfume...</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>It is a light, very girly scent which stays on for a full day.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Coach Poppy fragrance, it wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li>But that is normal with most perfumes right?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean, sweet, and soft.</li>
            <li>This is a great perfume that lasts all day long, and I highly suggest purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend other coach perfumes as well because they all smell so good!</li>
            <li>Overall a nice purchase.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say is the distributor representative Andrea was nice</li>
            <li>Bought it for my daughters bday was very excited it came early.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not normally a coach fan, i received a sample of this new scent when buying my favorite, and i loved it so much, i bought it.</li>
            <li>Only took a few days to come in which is always great!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I would buy at the Coach store.</li>
            <li>This was a much better price than getting a smaller bottle at the department stores.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone interested in this type of gift.</li>
            <li>I feel pretty when I wear it</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li>This is my first time reviewing a product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My wife had tried out many different perfumes and decided this was the one she wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>Came packaged excellant and $20 cheaper than in local store :))</li>
            <li>Such a lovely, feminine scent but</li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume several months ago and love it as much as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described and much cheaper than in retail stores.</li>
            <li>It is not my cup of tea, but my mother loves young fruity- florals and she was happy to get such a big bottle.</li>
            <li>It smells good when she first puts them on but after an hour, can&#x27;t hardly smell it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sexy, not overbearing kind of perfume,  it lasts all day, a little goes a long way, makes my husband melt</li>
            <li>Large bottle, identical to those in stores.  </li>
            <li>They smell similar but not the same and the real Coach Poppy lasts soo much longer!!!!!</li>
            <li>I really like the Coach perfume scents</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand some of the reviews, if you are curious what perfumes smell like go to a department store, smell them for free and buy them on here!</li>
            <li>Received it in a very timely manner as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a scam not even the real product.</li>
            <li>very mutch</li>
            <li>it is okay, just not as fragrant I expected.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>it smells really goood</li>
            <li>I have tried all the coach perfumes available and this is the only one I like!!</li>
            <li>I received my perfume, really fast.  </li>
            <li>Have contacted seller for a return or refund have not heard from them very up set.</li>
            <li>Really like the perfume</li>
            <li>I used to wear Obsession all the time, and that got quite a few nice compliments, but nothing like Poppy.</li>
            <li>It goes on light not too strong and is very long lasting.</li>
            <li>A must have it&#x27;s soft and elegant, a delight to smell, not loud and obnoxious or repelling.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife because she has had two different Coach Poppy sprays (from Sephora) in the last couple years and enjoyed them both</li>
            <li>I was complimented by 3 different gentlemen the very first day I wore this to work.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this perfume because I smelled it in the past and due to the GREAT price</li>
            <li>love the fact that I received my purchase way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Coach Poppy perfume for the past two years now, and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to get Amazon to own up to its quality, but I wanted to warn other buyers out there that this is packed and looks like Poppy and even smells almost the same, but it does not last.</li>
            <li>The scent didn&#x27;t last more than 30min., as if it had been watered down.</li>
            <li>the bottle is supposed to be clear and with a bow...</li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter and myself @32.</li>
            <li>I wear this perfume alot and it never gets old.</li>
            <li>So far it has lasted her up until now, and probably will for another month or so.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more dollars and purchase in a local store.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars only because it is not the longest lasting parfum and because there are other fragrances I like better</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun and flirty, smells like a poppy candle and is long lasting</li>
            <li>This product had a slightly different smell than the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Poppy she&#x27;s had in the past and has lasted at the most two hours.  </li>
            <li>It barely has a scent.</li>
            <li>Has such a swell and soft smell.</li>
            <li>Perfume leaked in package as the top was broken.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this scent to anyone that is looking for something long lasting that&#x27;s not overpowering!</li>
            <li>The real thing at 20% less than department stores.  </li>
            <li>Nice and delicate not overwhelming</li>
            <li>Although I thought this was a little &amp;#34;Pricey&amp;#34;, it was very well received on Christmas morning.  </li>
            <li>It was not at all what I expected it to be, the price was too high and the perfume does not last that long</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I think it has more of a spring/summer floral scent to it.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume, but sprayer broke after 3 squirts.  </li>
            <li> We love coach perfume.</li>
            <li> and I was happy to find the EDP at such a good price.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and I don&#x27;t know if this is authentic.</li>

            <li> It is such a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> and I get many compliments when I wear</li>
            <li> ALL TIME FAVORITE SCENTS.</li>
            <li> I even looked it up to make sure.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully someone else experience would be better.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume one of my favorites :)</li>
            <li> I spray it on myself before bed purely for my own enjoyment!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too overpowering or cheap-smelling, and it&#x27;s very clean.</li>
            <li> She loved since the first time she tried it as a sample</li>
            <li> Came in the original box!  </li>
            <li> I found this to be a very light scent which is fine because I do not want something that is over powering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good at lasting too.</li>
            <li> Very sweet smell to me.</li>
            <li> Scent disappears very quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells fruity but not too strong.  </li>
            <li> Its not that strong of a smell</li>
            <li> It is perfect, somewhat flora, but not super strong, and a hint of something sensual.</li>
            <li> because it is much cheaper on that website, i love the fragrance, i just wish it would linger longer!</li>
            <li> This smell is very pleasing, very fruity and floral and for the price on here its a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> And if you can smell your own perfume, ANY perfume, hours after you put it on, you wear TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> And it smells great, she only uses like two sprays a day</li>
            <li> and it was confirmed again when she received the bottle.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s more than enough to smell good.</li>
            <li> I very rarely buy myself perfume because I am so picky.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance from coach, it&#x27;s so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent, smells amazing, however it does not last as long as I thought it would but who cares....</li>
            <li> I still had some of my original that I bought a couple of months ago</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Originally got a 1 oz.</li>
            <li> I put it on every day and still am not sick of it.</li>
            <li> it smells good but the bottle and packaging was different than the one i had seen in sephora.</li>
            <li> and this is sweet and flowery.</li>
            <li> I discovered this last year and loved it</li>
            <li> It smells sweet in the bottle and after you spray it on you get citrus and floral.  </li>
            <li> Appears to be the true item.  </li>
            <li> Floral and sweet.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PERFUME.</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and light.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it on and absolutely fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that citric yet not that sweet</li>
            <li> I recommend this one if you do not like super &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; scents, and the purple box if you do prefer a flower scent.</li>
            <li> I feel like it dissipates too quickly, and wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I always wear D&amp;G Light Blue which is very light and clean smelling</li>
            <li> I now know my new favorite perfume...</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> It is a light, very girly scent which stays on for a full day.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Coach Poppy fragrance, it wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li> But that is normal with most perfumes right?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very clean, sweet, and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume that lasts all day long, and I highly suggest purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend other coach perfumes as well because they all smell so good!</li>
            <li> Overall a nice purchase.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is the distributor representative Andrea was nice</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughters bday was very excited it came early.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not normally a coach fan, i received a sample of this new scent when buying my favorite, and i loved it so much, i bought it.</li>
            <li> Only took a few days to come in which is always great!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I would buy at the Coach store.</li>
            <li> This was a much better price than getting a smaller bottle at the department stores.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone interested in this type of gift.</li>
            <li> I feel pretty when I wear it</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li> This is my first time reviewing a product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My wife had tried out many different perfumes and decided this was the one she wanted.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Came packaged excellant and $20 cheaper than in local store :))</li>
            <li> Such a lovely, feminine scent but</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume several months ago and love it as much as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described and much cheaper than in retail stores.</li>
            <li> It is not my cup of tea, but my mother loves young fruity- florals and she was happy to get such a big bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells good when she first puts them on but after an hour, can&#x27;t hardly smell it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sexy, not overbearing kind of perfume,  it lasts all day, a little goes a long way, makes my husband melt</li>
            <li> Large bottle, identical to those in stores.  </li>
            <li> They smell similar but not the same and the real Coach Poppy lasts soo much longer!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the Coach perfume scents</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the reviews, if you are curious what perfumes smell like go to a department store, smell them for free and buy them on here!</li>
            <li> Received it in a very timely manner as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a scam not even the real product.</li>
            <li> very mutch</li>
            <li> it is okay, just not as fragrant I expected.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> it smells really goood</li>
            <li> I have tried all the coach perfumes available and this is the only one I like!!</li>
            <li> I received my perfume, really fast.  </li>
            <li> Have contacted seller for a return or refund have not heard from them very up set.</li>
            <li> Really like the perfume</li>
            <li> I used to wear Obsession all the time, and that got quite a few nice compliments, but nothing like Poppy.</li>
            <li> It goes on light not too strong and is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> A must have it&#x27;s soft and elegant, a delight to smell, not loud and obnoxious or repelling.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she has had two different Coach Poppy sprays (from Sephora) in the last couple years and enjoyed them both</li>
            <li> I was complimented by 3 different gentlemen the very first day I wore this to work.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this perfume because I smelled it in the past and due to the GREAT price</li>
            <li> love the fact that I received my purchase way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Coach Poppy perfume for the past two years now, and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get Amazon to own up to its quality, but I wanted to warn other buyers out there that this is packed and looks like Poppy and even smells almost the same, but it does not last.</li>
            <li> The scent didn&#x27;t last more than 30min., as if it had been watered down.</li>
            <li> the bottle is supposed to be clear and with a bow...</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter and myself @32.</li>
            <li> I wear this perfume alot and it never gets old.</li>
            <li> So far it has lasted her up until now, and probably will for another month or so.</li>
            <li> Spend a few more dollars and purchase in a local store.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars only because it is not the longest lasting parfum and because there are other fragrances I like better</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun and flirty, smells like a poppy candle and is long lasting</li>
            <li> This product had a slightly different smell than the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Poppy she&#x27;s had in the past and has lasted at the most two hours.  </li>
            <li> It barely has a scent.</li>
            <li> Has such a swell and soft smell.</li>
            <li> Perfume leaked in package as the top was broken.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this scent to anyone that is looking for something long lasting that&#x27;s not overpowering!</li>
            <li> The real thing at 20% less than department stores.  </li>
            <li> Nice and delicate not overwhelming</li>
            <li> Although I thought this was a little &amp;#34;Pricey&amp;#34;, it was very well received on Christmas morning.  </li>
            <li> It was not at all what I expected it to be, the price was too high and the perfume does not last that long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable, really.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, my husband surprised me with a bottle of this perfume!</li>
            <li> Lots of other perfumes I have bought (some of which have been more expensive than this one) seem to wear off mid-day which is super frustrating.</li>
            <li> We originally found it at Macy&#x27;s, and I spent at least 20 dollars less by buying it on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Fruity smell, not so harsh and loud</li>
            <li> but it lasts for quite long</li>
            <li> and it stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> Scent didn&#x27;t stick very long</li>
            <li> This perfume goes for the same price, but  HALF  </li>
            <li> A few hours later, once I was home, I could still smell it on my scarf that was hanging up as I walked by it.</li>
            <li> Minus 10 stars</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I expected.</li>
            <li> She has the other Coach parfums and raves about them.  </li>
            <li> If you want an imitation, Five Below has it for $5.00.</li>
            <li> This company make quality product and never lets you down.</li>
            <li> and I thought Amazon hasn&#x27;t let me down yet, until now.  </li>
            <li> not twenty four hours as expected,  could be stronger based on price of both items , not really satisfied would recommend</li>
            <li> a little to flowery smelling for me.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but it is a little bit weaker than I would have thought.</li>
            <li> In the past I have purchased perfumes from Amazon and didnt have any issues with them</li>
            <li> ILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Not much more</li>
            <li> I usually put 3 sprays on my neck/chest area and a couple on my wrist and rub them together.</li>
            <li> The sprayer on the bottle was broken and I am convinced it is due to diluting the perfume.</li>
            <li> it is hard to find it because it is not sell out of the states yet.</li>
            <li> Someone makes a comment at least once a month.</li>
            <li> If I could give it negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> So I can say this lasts at least 24-hours.</li>
            <li> I ordered it Christmas eve, and got it within a few days!!  </li>
            <li> That doesnt necessarily mean others can&#x27;t smell it on you.</li>
            <li> The perfume has a very faint smell no where close to the others we have bought from the same designer.</li>
            <li> Half the price of the department stores!!!</li>
            <li> and she did indeed give me my money back because I received a bad item.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this perfume especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> but the prices in the stores are crazy.</li>
            <li> disappointed .</li>
            <li> I thought I hit the jackpot. :(</li>
            <li> It shipped in time for christmas and made for a shocking surprize as she opened it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years- definitely one of my favorites. This is exactly what I would buy at the Coach store.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great. And I could not believe I found it here for $40 dollars cheaper than a leading retail store. Love this stuff. Was a great gift for my wife. And she loves the scent as well.</li>
            <li> Perfume leaked in package as the top was broken. Obviously not the companies fault so I tried contacting seller to see if I could get a replacement. No response. Scent is weaker than actual Coach Poppy. Smell does not last.</li>
            <li> A wonderful light fresh scent. I&#x27;m wearing it now in the winter months but I think it has more of a spring/summer floral scent to it. Nice and delicate not overwhelming</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances and it lasts all day! I get compliments every time I wear it!</li>
            <li> It was not at all what I expected it to be, the price was too high and the perfume does not last that long, I wish i would have waited for when fragrance.com got it back in stock (They have it now) because it is much cheaper on that website, i love the fragrance, i just wish it would linger longer!</li>
            <li> perfume was cheaper and delivered on time with coupons for next time</li>
            <li> Smells great and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the wife for Christmas. It came as advertised, smelt great, huge bottle, and the wife was happy. This was a much better price than getting a smaller bottle at the department stores.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume, but sprayer broke after 3 squirts.  seller refunded my money and let me keep the faulty merchandise.  I broke the cap off and use it as a splash on!</li>
            <li> This is My Daughters favorite! Came packaged as shown and size is as states. We love coach perfume. This is a good size.</li>
            <li> This is the EDP (versus EDT) so expect it to linger for hours or even days! I really like the Coach perfume scents and I was happy to find the EDP at such a good price.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in perfect shape. I would recommend this to anyone interested in this type of gift. Well done.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance from coach, it&#x27;s so fresh and clean. I feel pretty when I wear it and it last all day.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend wanted this kind of parfume, so I got it and she loves it.. says the bottle size is bigger and the price was cheaper.. so this was a great purchase..</li>
            <li> i got the 3.4 oz.. it smells good but the bottle and packaging was different than the one i had seen in sephora. the bottle is supposed to be clear and with a bow... the one i received was a gold bottle with no bow. im assuming this is a knock off.</li>
            <li> I have not opened the package yet because I am giving it away as a Christmas gift.  I will need to update the feedback on this later.  The box came as described, but there was no &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; packaging.  The box came inside the mailing box and there was no stuffing or anything like that.</li>
            <li> a little to flowery smelling for me. I always wear D&amp;G Light Blue which is very light and clean smelling and this is sweet and flowery. If that is what you like then you will like this.</li>
            <li> I was complimented by 3 different gentlemen the very first day I wore this to work. I am sold! Love it. Will definitely buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li> Great product and well worth it. This company make quality product and never lets you down. Always a pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, she loved the perfume.  We originally found it at Macy&#x27;s, and I spent at least 20 dollars less by buying it on amazon.  Smells fruity but not too strong.  I don&#x27;t understand some of the reviews, if you are curious what perfumes smell like go to a department store, smell them for free and buy them on here!</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell, feminine and endearing without being too sweet. Could last a bit longer, but if you keep it on you, one spray should do the trick to refresh.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I very rarely buy myself perfume because I am so picky. I discovered this last year and loved it but the prices in the stores are crazy. This is a fantastic price for the amount you get. It is almost double the amount that I paid the same price for in the store for only 1 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it. Received it in a very timely manner as well.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells. I would have given it 5 stars, but it is a little bit weaker than I would have thought. Perhaps that is the difference between eau de parfum and eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly as described, it is not a knock off, and what a great price! Perfect birthday gift!</li>
            <li> I found this to be a very light scent which is fine because I do not want something that is over powering. Coach also has another scent  might try next time.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a valentines day present for my wife and she loves it. I can&#x27;t complain when she wears it. It&#x27;s a perfect perfume that isn&#x27;t too powerful. 2-3 sprays will last all day when my wife wears it.</li>
            <li> This perfume doesn&#x27;t last at all. In the past I have purchased perfumes from Amazon and didnt have any issues with them but this one doesn&#x27;t even last an hour .Very disappointed . Will not buy it from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Came in the original box!  Not used.  I really like this smell and the product is great!  There was no damage to the box or container.</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife and she loved it! It shipped in time for christmas and made for a shocking surprize as she opened it!</li>
            <li> This was a really wonderful purchase for me. It&#x27;s attractive, functional and I was in every way pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Although I thought this was a little &amp;#34;Pricey&amp;#34;, it was very well received on Christmas morning.  Product arrived in plenty of time for the holiday.  Overall a nice purchase.</li>
            <li> It smells sweet in the bottle and after you spray it on you get citrus and floral.  I agree that it is a great summer time fragrance. I gave it 3 stars only because it is not the longest lasting parfum and because there are other fragrances I like better but this is in my top 5.</li>
            <li> Got this for My wife for mothers day and she loved it .Smells so good.Found it here at an excellent price and the response time was excellent as far as shipping .Would highly recommend buying here and I definitely will buy from here again.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughters bday was very excited it came early. She loves it. Smells very good and good size too.</li>
            <li> I actually meant to order a different Coach Poppy but I was NOT disappointed when I smelled this one!!! It is perfect, somewhat flora, but not super strong, and a hint of something sensual. Everywhere I go I get compliments. I recommend this one if you do not like super &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; scents, and the purple box if you do prefer a flower scent. Also, it was cheaper than at the department store, SCORE!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my wife as gift. She says loves it. According to her it is the same as in the department store.</li>
            <li> I bought the Coach Poppy and Juicy both which I have at home from  Macy&#x27;s I was just running low and decided to buy from here... They smell similar but not the same and the real Coach Poppy lasts soo much longer!!!!! This one does not. I will never buy from the seller again it&#x27;s a scam not even the real product.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Coach Poppy fragrance, it wears off very quickly. I still had some of my original that I bought a couple of months ago and the difference was noticeable.</li>
            <li> The real thing at 20% less than department stores.  What else needs to be said?  No gripes on this product for the price.</li>
            <li> Our son requested this for his fiance.  She had run out and with Christmas approaching this was on her favorites list.</li>
            <li> Just as described girlfriend loved it got here in the amount of time as said . Would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Gift for 22-yr,-old granddaughter... she was SO excited and happy when she opened it.  It is now HER signature fragrance and she got it from her Grandma!</li>
            <li> I was realy looking for the coach poppy &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; parfum, but I like this1 very mutch so im keeping it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! I love it! I love it! I love it! It&#x27;s not too strong and great for the price. It&#x27;s very good at lasting too.</li>
            <li> Very sweet smell to me. It&#x27;s okay. Not my fave</li>
            <li> Best price for this product.  Daughter very satisfied with the scent.  Appears to be the true item.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fruity smell, not so harsh and loud, it is pleasant. Best choice to make when choosing a pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot for reviewing!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Floral and sweet.  I love this scent.  It&#x27;s especially nice in the spring and summer, but I wear it year-round.</li>
            <li> I love this smell!! And the Price!!!!!! it is a great product and i am so happy i choose it on Amazon!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! I spray it on myself before bed purely for my own enjoyment! Others love it too! My 14 year old daughter and myself @32. I also own Juicy Coture, and Burberry. Good perfume is a treat for any woman. This is a treat just for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that hubby likes it too. I feel like it dissipates too quickly, and wish it lasted longer. But that is normal with most perfumes right?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and I don&#x27;t know if this is authentic. It smells good when she first puts them on but after an hour, can&#x27;t hardly smell it. Don&#x27;t waisted your money on this. If you want an imitation, Five Below has it for $5.00.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it.  She has the other Coach parfums and raves about them.  Would recommend to anyone who already loves coach products.</li>
            <li> Bought for my sis in law for Xmas. She loves the scent and it was nice to be able to get a good sized bottle online.</li>
            <li> This is my first time reviewing a product on Amazon.  My husband bought this for me a year ago for a birthday gift.  I have never received more compliments on a perfume or cologne than this.  Someone makes a comment at least once a month. It&#x27;s unbelievable, really.  I now know my new favorite perfume...even if I can&#x27;t smell it myself.  I used to wear Obsession all the time, and that got quite a few nice compliments, but nothing like Poppy.</li>
            <li> If I could give it negative stars I would. The sprayer on the bottle was broken and I am convinced it is due to diluting the perfume. It barely has a scent. Do not purchase this product. Spend a few more dollars and purchase in a local store.</li>
            <li> The scent didn&#x27;t last more than 30min., as if it had been watered down. I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> it is okay, just not as fragrant I expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance. I bought two and gave one as a gift.  The package arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT SO MUCH. THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PERFUME. DEFINITELY SAVED MONEY WITH THIS. LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND ILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I will use this company for future purchases!&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that I received my purchase way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> She loved it! Not much more I can say about it... Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  Smells so fresh and light.  Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> perfum smells amazing, bought it for my daughter but had to end up buying one for my self. Has such a swell and soft smell.</li>
            <li> My wife had tried out many different perfumes and decided this was the one she wanted. The product was exactly as described and much cheaper than in retail stores.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not normally a coach fan, i received a sample of this new scent when buying my favorite, and i loved it so much, i bought it. it&#x27;s fun and flirty, smells like a poppy candle and is long lasting</li>
            <li> Great perfume will order again</li>
            <li> Coach Poppy Perfume definitely lived up to my expectations I wear this perfume alot and it never gets old. I have gotten so many nice compliments on the aroma It goes on light not too strong and is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> great buy.  This was a gift for my daughter and she loved it.  Would recommend buying this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> A must have it&#x27;s soft and elegant, a delight to smell, not loud and obnoxious or repelling.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.  Thank You,</li>
            <li> Half the price of the department stores!!! i am so in love with this Coach Smell and I am excited I can buy more than one!</li>
            <li> My husband and I were walking through the mall when I saw a tester of this perfume. I sprayed it on and absolutely fell in love with the scent. It&#x27;s very clean, sweet, and soft. My husband liked it too. A few hours later, once I was home, I could still smell it on my scarf that was hanging up as I walked by it. When I wore the scarf to work the very next day, I received compliments on the scent from a coworker! So I can say this lasts at least 24-hours. A few weeks ago, my husband surprised me with a bottle of this perfume! I put it on every day and still am not sick of it. I would highly recommend this scent to anyone that is looking for something long lasting that&#x27;s not overpowering!</li>
            <li> Scent disappears very quickly. Was disappointed in this perfume especially for the price I paid. I Don&#x27;t even bother to wear it often</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and this is the cheapest place I have found it. It&#x27;s smell so good.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful price is right, bought it for my wife and she felt in love with it I even check if it was the official one from the store and it is great price compared to the store. big bottle and perfume does not go away in three hours. we even tested out put some on her hands washed it out with soap and still was there great quality perfume</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite. Pricey but worth it. Will order again when I run out. I love the spray.</li>
            <li> it smells really goood I recomened it! Its not that strong of a smell but it lasts for quite long</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Coach Poppy perfume for the past two years now, and I absolutely LOVE it. It&#x27;s the perfect perfume. It&#x27;s not too overpowering or cheap-smelling, and it&#x27;s very clean. This is a great perfume that lasts all day long, and I highly suggest purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Amazing fragrance! A wonderful new addition to my collection. Only took a few days to come in which is always great!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, service was great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume several months ago and love it as much as the day I bought it. It is a light, very girly scent which stays on for a full day. Lots of other perfumes I have bought (some of which have been more expensive than this one) seem to wear off mid-day which is super frustrating. This perfume, however, seems to stay on all day and I can still smell it at night when I come home. I usually put 3 sprays on my neck/chest area and a couple on my wrist and rub them together. It is such a wonderful smell. I will definitely keep purchasing this perfume for years to come. I would highly recommend other coach perfumes as well because they all smell so good!</li>
            <li> very nice perfume. i love it. it is hard to find it because it is not sell out of the states yet. i will recommend this fragrance to the citric fragrance lovers. it&#x27;s not that citric yet not that sweet and it stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> I got knock off perfume! NEVER AGAIN!!! Minus 10 stars</li>
            <li> Scent didn&#x27;t stick very long</li>
            <li> I love love love coach poppy perfume!!! I have tried all the coach perfumes available and this is the only one I like!! It&#x27;s a sexy, not overbearing kind of perfume,  it lasts all day, a little goes a long way, makes my husband melt and I get many compliments when I wear :) great to wear any season for any occasion!! Came packaged excellant and $20 cheaper than in local store :))</li>
            <li> This smell is very pleasing, very fruity and floral and for the price on here its a great deal. One of my ALL TIME FAVORITE SCENTS.</li>
            <li> not twenty four hours as expected,  could be stronger based on price of both items , not really satisfied would recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter at Christmas. I was very happy with the price I paid for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> If you LOVE this perfume and want to get it at the BEST price, buy it from here!!  I received my perfume, really fast.  I ordered it Christmas eve, and got it within a few days!!  This perfume goes for the same price, but  HALF  the SIZE of this.  I even looked it up to make sure.  This is the best price you can get it.  Coach Poppy is my favorite perfume, and guys love it!!  This is a must buy for sure!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent, smells amazing, however it does not last as long as I thought it would but who cares....it smells just that good, I&#x27;ll keep reapplying!</li>
            <li> Came in today, sold by Amazon.  Wrapped in cellophane, in the proper packaging. Large bottle, identical to those in stores.  To those who say its a knock off, understand that different types of perfume work differently on every person.  Even what you wash your clothes in makes a difference. It&#x27;s all chemistry. And if you can smell your own perfume, ANY perfume, hours after you put it on, you wear TOO MUCH. Your nose gets accustomed.  That doesnt necessarily mean others can&#x27;t smell it on you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I expected. It smells great, I have gotten tons of complements on this perfume. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she has had two different Coach Poppy sprays (from Sephora) in the last couple years and enjoyed them both and I thought Amazon hasn&#x27;t let me down yet, until now.  The price and shipping were great but that is where it ended.  This product had a slightly different smell than the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Poppy she&#x27;s had in the past and has lasted at the most two hours.  I&#x27;m trying to get Amazon to own up to its quality, but I wanted to warn other buyers out there that this is packed and looks like Poppy and even smells almost the same, but it does not last.</li>
            <li> Originally got a 1 oz. bottle for my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday in January this year. So far it has lasted her up until now, and probably will for another month or so. But the thing is I got that 1 oz. for the same price as this, so in theory, depending on your usage, this could last you 3 years. And it smells great, she only uses like two sprays a day and that&#x27;s more than enough to smell good. Great value.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is the distributor representative Andrea was nice and she did indeed give me my money back because I received a bad item. Hopefully someone else experience would be better. I really wanted this perfume because I smelled it in the past and due to the GREAT price I thought I hit the jackpot. :(</li>
            <li> It is not my cup of tea, but my mother loves young fruity- florals and she was happy to get such a big bottle. I was happy to get it for so cheap!</li>
            <li> Such a lovely, feminine scent but at the same time it&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> The perfume has a very faint smell no where close to the others we have bought from the same designer. Have contacted seller for a return or refund have not heard from them very up set. Don&#x27;t buy from this seller</li>
            <li> this product was a gift it was well received</li>
            <li> The smell is beautiful and light. Good price too!</li>
            <li> My wife love this perfume!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume one of my favorites :)</li>
            <li> Really like the perfume it smells great! I chose it cause I smelled a sample in a magazine and liked it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife for Mother&#x27;s day and she absolutely loved it. She loved since the first time she tried it as a sample and it was confirmed again when she received the bottle.</li>
