            <li> Well I guess I should have read the weight, but these are little samples, and, IT TOOK ALMOST A MONTH, and got it after Christmas.  Thank goodness it was not a present, the product I guess I will try as soon as I get over it.</li>
            <li> I hated traveling with my larger size products &amp; transferring them to a smaller bottle was a pain.  These little sizes are perfect!</li>
            <li> I have really loved all of the Philosophy products that I&#x27;ve purchased.  Good quality ingredients makes remarkable products.  Will keep on purchasing them.</li>
            <li> I love this product makes your face feel really soft and clean, it goes on easy makes face look smooth.</li>
            <li> So I have the purity wash that I have been using and I really like it so decided to buy the travel size and try these other products one time. Really do not like the smell of the microdelivery wash so probably won&#x27;t be using that very often and the hope in a jar is another story. I took it with me on a weekend trip and a lot of it stuck to the lid of the jar and then started leaking water which I found really weird. Not sure if it is a packaging issue but it was kind of a waste. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Tried to purchase item twice and it was cancelled both times because it is &amp;#34;out of stock&amp;#34;. Yet the page continues to list it as &amp;#34;in stock&amp;#34;? I&#x27;ll buy it somewhere else and save money.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Very happy to find this cheaper than what I pay at Beauty Brands or Shepora. Have bought this set more than once.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Philosophy products.  I feel these three products are the best, a great way to try them out.</li>
            <li> I use Purity and scrub products daily. I bought the package because I travel by plane for business .  The Hope product smell was so rank I tossed it.  Not sure if it was old or spoiled. The other two were ok.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for so little...</li>
            <li> Can be a little drying that is why I gave four stars. But good face wash.</li>
            <li> I love philosophy products.  This purchase was so nice because it was the prefect size to try out new products.</li>
            <li> This is a great combination of cleansers for your face. I saw the difference in my skin right away. Also for what it cost it last a long time. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve given this little set to my mother-in-law, sister, and daughter. It&#x27;s a great way for somebody to try the products just to see if they like them. It is also great for traveling so you don&#x27;t have to take the larger ones with you.</li>
            <li> This system is just the BEST! My skin was in desperate need of moisture...and as ALWAYS..philosophy delivers the hydration it needed! I can no longer afford the bigger sizes of these products. .but when I&#x27;m able to treat myself to something small..I always choose this skin care system...love love love it!!</li>
            <li> great for traveling, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans all that great.  I like the moisturizing cream though.  ty</li>
            <li> The hope sample is really small</li>
            <li> I love the Philosophy products and this was a perfect gift item that I was looking to give to a friend. The package arrived quickly and the containers had not been previously opened (seals were still in place). My only complaint was that I thought they would be kept in the Philosophy gift box but instead were sent as individuals.</li>
            <li> I love all the products in this kit. I purchased the kit to use as travel items. Purity is great for taking off makeup. My face never feel tight or dry. The microexfoliating wash has these tiny scrubbing bits in it so it is gentle enough to use freqently. And hope in a jar feels like heaven on my skin. The whipped texture is so unique and it feels so good and absorbs so well into my skin. My boss uses it and her skin is smooth and healthy looking. Between my boss and Oprah I figured I needed to give this a try. Very happy with it. It  will always be a part of my skin care regimen. I like the travel size better because for one its cheaper but the products last so long because you only need to use a little. I know you get better value when you buy larger sizes but if I bought the normal size bottles it would easily last me a year and I always worry if I am going to still love it that long. Your face and turn on you and become tolerant or suddenly irritated by the products you swore by three months ago. But if you don&#x27;t have that problem then you should definitely buy the bigger ones. They are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great products. Happy with purchase. No regrets.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister-in-law&#x27;s birthday and when she opened it the products were so small I would be surprised if she could get 4 uses out of them each. For $40 it was an embarrassing gift and a complete waste of my money. (Please note that I have  purchased the full size items for myself from Sephora and I absolutely love the product, it&#x27;s just this set that is a total rip off).</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my BFF, she is in love with these skin care products as much as I am now.  Philosophy is awesome!!  I love how the purity facial cleanser make my face (and other body parts I use it on) feel baby soft and soooooo clean!!  I used to break out with other cleansers, NOT PHILOSOPHY.  I highly recommend these products!!  This little package is the best way to start, you can test out the product in a smaller size before YOU decide you are in love with it.  Trust me, you&#x27;ll keep coming back for more.  Amazon&#x27;s prices are WAY WAY CHEAPER than Philosophy.com</li>
            <li> I have tried so many Skincare products but nothing has compared to philosophy. It is easy to use and leaves your skin feeling amazing</li>
            <li> Great trial products before buying. Love this for my 40 year old skin. Love philosophy products, will be buying again.</li>
