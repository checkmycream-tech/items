            <li>and I thought I managed to get a good deal.</li>
            <li>I love it, and the price is great.</li>
            <li>so you are sure to get the best available price.</li>
            <li>a \\&quot;buyer beware\\&quot; market for sure!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that products like this (and there are so many!)</li>
            <li>It was kind of watery</li>
            <li>Although it was a nice cream I did not see alot of firming going on there.</li>
            <li>I use this product lightly underneath my eyes to maintain my skin and its very effective.</li>
            <li>Great price and a quick arrival</li>
            <li>&quot; It is just as - often more - effective than anything you can buy in the drugstore or at the makeup counter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Avon products through the years and for the most part I have liked what I have purchased except for this firming cream.  </li>
            <li>THESE PRODUCTS REALLY WORK GREAT, DONNA</li>
            <li>I was glad to use it up</li>
            <li>, I WAS REALLY SURPRISED, AVON MAKES GREAT PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>It is very good at keeping your skin moist and tight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 with fine lines from sun exposure and haven&#x27;t seen any reduction after 2 months of consistent use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Skin feels tighter and firmer within moments of first use.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and have had no bad reactions to this product.</li>
            <li>And this has really improved my skins texture and firmness.</li>
            <li>Who wants these on their skin, the largest organ of the body that absorbs whatever it comes into contact with?</li>
            <li>They really should.</li>
            <li>he can give you personal service, always free delivery, and alert you to upcoming sales.</li>
            <li>I really like Avon products and have used them for years.</li>
            <li>your looking for firming this cream really</li>
            <li>This cream really does work.</li>
            <li>, BOTH THESE PRODUCTS DO NOT CAUSE ANY BREAKOUTS, I RECOMMEND THE DRAMATIC FIRMING CREAM TO ANYONE WHO WANTS A GREAT PRODUCT THAT DOES NOT TAKE YOU TO THE BANK, AND IT REALLY WORKS, ALSO GET THE MAJAX FACE PROTECTOR WITH SUNSCREEN</li>
            <li>This is a discontinued product it seemed however it doesnot appear to be the original firming cream as I remeber back in the days</li>
            <li>You can choose a local rep to get credit for the sale, but you do not get the personal service you would get if you ordered directly from the rep or the rep&#x27;s own website.</li>
            <li>I thought this would help keep my face more firm and youthful.  </li>
            <li>Sure, these compounds are used in small amounts, but over time they build up in the body and wreak havoc on your health and well being.</li>
            <li>Classy.  </li>
            <li>At 40 years old, having lost over 100 lbs.</li>
            <li>tried several products and nothing seemed to really do</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;Within a week I&#x27;m seeing a big difference in the skins tone and texture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find this out as I do not buy things like this</li>
            <li>I actually use this on my tummy, and it really tightens the skin.  </li>
            <li>This seems like a decent basic face lotion, but I&#x27;m not seeing any of the results promised.</li>
            <li>and I found it to be good for my dry skin, even though I did not noticed any dramatic &amp;#34;extra firming&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>only gave it 4 stars though because it is a very think cream that takes alot of rubbing in, or your left with alot of white streaks.</li>
            <li>The instant face lift bottle was completely damaged, pump not working and top broken.  </li>
            <li>I FEEL THAT THIS DRAMATIC FIRMING CREAM IS BETTER THAN CREAMS THAT COST OVER $100.00, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 5 DAYS</li>
            <li>It might be a little heavy for the summer, but for now with the cold and windy weather it is perfect.</li>

            <li> It might be a little heavy for the summer, but for now with the cold and windy weather it is perfect.</li>
            <li> It is kind of greasy with no real results, and when used with my eye makeup it made it run like crazy onto my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim a couple of years ago and every once in a while I break down and buy some ridiculously expensive firming cream only to use it and think, \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t I just buy more of the Avon stuff?\\</li>
            <li> It did not take long to see a tightening of my neck.  </li>
            <li> My neck seriously started to do the whole turkeyneck</li>
            <li> im not sure if its the creme or me just getting old...</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it&#x27;s not worth the shipping hassle for the same results as a Target lotion; I&#x27;m going to try something</li>
            <li> I just received Avon&#x27;s Dramatic Firming Cream and was very disappointed to discover that it contains 7 toxic and carcinogenic ingredients that I can identify -- maybe more:     Butylene glycol - Toxic, according to the EPA, which warns against contact to prevent brain, liver &amp; kidney abnormalities; it penetrates the skin, weakens proteins &amp; cellular structures; it&#x27;s found in anti-freeze &amp; is strong enough to remove barnacles from boats!     </li>
            <li> This cream does have a firming feel and goes a long way, is a little greasy, but causes no outbreak.</li>
            <li> Triethanolamine - Carcinogenic; interacts with nitrates to form carcinogenic nitrosamines; restricted in Europe due to carcinogenic effects (liver &amp; kidney cancer); disrupts hormones.    </li>
            <li> I was desperate to find this face cream, as it has been a staple in my beauty regime for over 30 years and now AVON wants to discontinue it !</li>
            <li> ; reduces skin&#x27;s natural moisture, increases signs of aging and leaves one vulnerable to bacteria; it&#x27;s used in spray-on oven cleaners and other cleansers to dissolve grease and oil!     </li>
            <li> I am 40 and was looking for an affordable firming cream for those little sags and wrinkles here</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t wasted, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> , my neck was seriously doing the turkey thing.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I used this cream and I found it to be good for my dry skin, even though I did not noticed any dramatic &amp;#34;extra firming&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 jars of this cream. It is very good at keeping your skin moist and tight. It might be a little heavy for the summer, but for now with the cold and windy weather it is perfect. The price can&#x27;t be beat. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had weight lose surgery in 2008 and I&#x27;ve lost over 100 lbs, my neck was seriously doing the turkey thing.&lt;br /&gt;Until I started using this, I use it morning and night. And this has really improved my skins texture and firmness.</li>
            <li> Skin feels tighter and firmer within moments of first use. I use this product lightly underneath my eyes to maintain my skin and its very effective. I reccomend using with a good quality rosehip oil</li>
            <li> Thought the product was not firming at all.  It was kind of watery and I got no results.</li>
            <li> I just received Avon&#x27;s Dramatic Firming Cream and was very disappointed to discover that it contains 7 toxic and carcinogenic ingredients that I can identify -- maybe more:     Butylene glycol - Toxic, according to the EPA, which warns against contact to prevent brain, liver &amp; kidney abnormalities; it penetrates the skin, weakens proteins &amp; cellular structures; it&#x27;s found in anti-freeze &amp; is strong enough to remove barnacles from boats!     Propylene glycol - Same as above.    PEG-100 - Carcinogenic; reduces skin&#x27;s natural moisture, increases signs of aging and leaves one vulnerable to bacteria; it&#x27;s used in spray-on oven cleaners and other cleansers to dissolve grease and oil!     PEG-150 - Same as above.    Triethanolamine - Carcinogenic; interacts with nitrates to form carcinogenic nitrosamines; restricted in Europe due to carcinogenic effects (liver &amp; kidney cancer); disrupts hormones.    Methylparaben - Carcinogenic; linked to breast cancer and endocrine disruption.    Parfume/fragrance - Carcinogenic (some) &amp; toxic.     Who wants these on their skin, the largest organ of the body that absorbs whatever it comes into contact with? It&#x27;s amazing that products like this (and there are so many!) don&#x27;t have to come with warning labels. They really should. Sure, these compounds are used in small amounts, but over time they build up in the body and wreak havoc on your health and well being. We need to be smarter consumers and avoid products like this at all costs. And, sellers need to list their products&#x27; ingredients! It&#x27;a a \\&quot;buyer beware\\&quot; market for sure!</li>
            <li> This product is on sale on a regular basis for $3.89. Do yourself a favor and find a local Avon rep. S/he can give you personal service, always free delivery, and alert you to upcoming sales. Also, s/he can order from 2 campaigns back so if an item was on sale in either of the last 2 brochures it can still be ordered for that sale price. You can also order from 2 campaigns back yourself at the rep&#x27;s website so you are sure to get the best available price. Ordering Avon from Amazon makes no sense. You can choose a local rep to get credit for the sale, but you do not get the personal service you would get if you ordered directly from the rep or the rep&#x27;s own website.</li>
            <li> I FEEL THAT THIS DRAMATIC FIRMING CREAM IS BETTER THAN CREAMS THAT COST OVER $100.00, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 5 DAYS AND IT WORKS GREAT, I WAS REALLY SURPRISED, AVON MAKES GREAT PRODUCTS, I USE IT IN THE MORNING AND EVENING, DURING THE DAY I USE MAJAX FACE PROTECTOR WITH SUNSCREEN, WHICH ALSO IS A GREAT PRODUCT, BOTH THESE PRODUCTS GO ON REAL SMOOTH AND WITH MY OILY SKIN IT KEEPS IT LOOKING GREAT ALL DAY, I AM SOMETIMES PRONE TO ACNE, BOTH THESE PRODUCTS DO NOT CAUSE ANY BREAKOUTS, I RECOMMEND THE DRAMATIC FIRMING CREAM TO ANYONE WHO WANTS A GREAT PRODUCT THAT DOES NOT TAKE YOU TO THE BANK, AND IT REALLY WORKS, ALSO GET THE MAJAX FACE PROTECTOR WITH SUNSCREEN, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED, A MUST TRY, AND GREAT VALUE, BUT THE BEST THING IS,[[ASIN:B000ZRBSHC Avon Dramatic Firming Cream]] THESE PRODUCTS REALLY WORK GREAT, DONNA</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with the \\&quot;instant face lift\\&quot;  I would order again, but not through this site, everything arrived last minute.  The instant face lift bottle was completely damaged, pump not working and top broken.  This cream does have a firming feel and goes a long way, is a little greasy, but causes no outbreak.</li>
            <li> This is a discontinued product it seemed however it doesnot appear to be the original firming cream as I remeber back in the days you would see results in a day or night after using it, so im not sure if its the creme or me just getting old...its the creme!</li>
            <li> I like using this product. It does make my skin feel firmer and tighter.  I really like Avon products and have used them for years.</li>
            <li> This seems like a decent basic face lotion, but I&#x27;m not seeing any of the results promised. I&#x27;m 25 with fine lines from sun exposure and haven&#x27;t seen any reduction after 2 months of consistent use.  Also, not a fan that there is no SPF protection in this item.  Bottom line, it&#x27;s not worth the shipping hassle for the same results as a Target lotion; I&#x27;m going to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I came back to this lotion when I ran out of my supply to give it another try.  I used this for about 6 weeks and was not satisified at all.  It is kind of greasy with no real results, and when used with my eye makeup it made it run like crazy onto my eyelids.  Classy.  I was glad to use it up so it wasn&#x27;t wasted, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> At 40 years old, having lost over 100 lbs. My neck seriously started to do the whole turkeyneck thing.&lt;br /&gt;I tried several products and nothing seemed to really do much.&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine sugested Avon and I&#x27;m telling you, This stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;Within a week I&#x27;m seeing a big difference in the skins tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;My neck is actually tightening.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for firming this cream really works.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars though because it is a very think cream that takes alot of rubbing in, or your left with alot of white streaks. It is not oily though and does not make you break out. I also have sensitive skin and have had no bad reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find this face cream, as it has been a staple in my beauty regime for over 30 years and now AVON wants to discontinue it ! Great price and a quick arrival - thank you !!</li>
            <li> This cream really does work. It did not take long to see a tightening of my neck.  It&#x27;s a great product for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I just got the product today I haven&#x27;t even used it. And it looks like it has been used already !!!!  There&#x27;s a big hole in the cream and u cannot move this cream around.  I&#x27;m so upset !!!</li>
            <li> Always buy my Avon cream on here, great price and good value, product is lovely!</li>
            <li> The firming cream works well.  I was surprised to find this out as I do not buy things like this but I figured since I wanted to start trying different things as I&#x27;am not getting any younger,I might try this for starters and I thought I managed to get a good deal. (Or so I thought.)&lt;br /&gt; I bought it through a lady who was selling Avon through Amazon, as it turned out it looked like it had been used  it was not in a box as well as the cover that you take off upon opening was there, but it had already been opened and it looked like some was missing.&lt;br /&gt; We wrote to Amazon who thankfully cares about their customers and they took care of thing&#x27;s so that&#x27;s my story and yes I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my tummy, and it really tightens the skin.  I love it, and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim a couple of years ago and every once in a while I break down and buy some ridiculously expensive firming cream only to use it and think, \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t I just buy more of the Avon stuff?\\&quot; It is just as - often more - effective than anything you can buy in the drugstore or at the makeup counter. I am almost 50 - my skin is awesome. If it ain&#x27;t broke...</li>
            <li> I am 40 and was looking for an affordable firming cream for those little sags and wrinkles here and there that start to creep up on you. I thought this would help keep my face more firm and youthful.  Although it was a nice cream I did not see alot of firming going on there. Diet, exercise, and lots of water seem to work well, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Avon products through the years and for the most part I have liked what I have purchased except for this firming cream.  I used this product for awhile and I didn&#x27;t notice any tightening on my face / neck.  I just use it on my neck in the morning and at night and sorry to say it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I will finish this jar and if it happens to suddenly work...then I&#x27;ll write an updated review.</li>
