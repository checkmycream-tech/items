            <li>Nice, very nice seller</li>
            <li>Goo works great, no break outs, And I break out very easily from any greasy stuff</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and works wonders when applying to a fresh tattoo, so soothing.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Tattoo Goo for over a dozen years and over a dozen tattoos.</li>
            <li>Works nicely and smells good too.</li>
            <li>Thank&#x27;s you very much for a good deal!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic in a tin!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love the Goo!</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is a better choice!</li>
            <li>it felt amazing, almost like putting aloe on a sunburn.</li>
            <li>This Goo is amazing.</li>
            <li>Kept my tattoos moist and nourished, and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>there, she&#x27;s awesome, so far (knock, knock), looks good.</li>
            <li>So nice to tattoo</li>
            <li>he used it on our daughters name scrolled on his bicep---seemed to protect it nicely.</li>
            <li>my tat is nice</li>
            <li>Best stuff for new and healing tattoos!</li>
            <li>Has pleasant fragrance and easy to apply and soothing to skin.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells, love the way it feels!</li>
            <li>the title says, this is the best tattoo protectant/healing salve I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got close to 30 hours of tattooing done so far and this best tattoo aftercare I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best of the batch so far of the items I&#x27;ve tried for tattoo aftercare.</li>
            <li>The product work&#x27;s great and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I could still use my arm fine, and bending it didn&#x27;t make my healing tattoo crack or bleed!  </li>
            <li>This was especially great in the first couple of months after getting fresh ink.</li>
            <li>I have many tattoos and almost every time I&#x27;ve gotten one, I use this while healing.</li>
            <li>5-star product for sure, and</li>
            <li>Just be sure to check with your doctor to make sure the salve and lotions are okay for you to use and to ensure you don&#x27;t have any allergies toit.it.</li>
            <li>It heals tattoos brighter than A&amp;D ointment and encourages more healing that just using lotion.  </li>
            <li>It makes even the oldest ones look better.</li>
            <li>Love the earthy, lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for many tattoos and still use it as part of my aftercare.</li>
            <li>It really makes your tattoos look and feel great.</li>
            <li>then the latest work I used this during the healing process.</li>
            <li>and i love the way it looked after I put this stuff on it</li>
            <li>Tattoo goo is a good product, ingredients are mostly all natural stuff, it has sooo many good reviews and alot of tattoo artist&#x27;s recommend it.</li>
            <li>and it got a bit better, before the retouch.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and my tattoos</li>
            <li>love the way it makes them feel (and look!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping, will def.</li>
            <li>be buying more again.</li>
            <li>Another reason I love this stuff is that it has vitamin E and lavender oil, which help in the healing process and not all tattoo ointments have those in them.</li>
            <li>I intend to order more...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, nothing works as well, use in place of lip gloss or chap stick.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not as greasy as Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>Great Product Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>Healing was so much better with this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff-</li>
            <li>it makes my tattoos look so healthy and</li>
            <li>sure</li>
            <li>And I love that.</li>
            <li>absolutely LOVE the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok... doesn&#x27;t stay moisturized on your skin.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it isn&#x27;t greasy so it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes if it gets on them.  </li>
            <li>It is very Soothing &amp; smells great.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t clog pores and smells pretty good to boot.</li>
            <li>, the color in my tattoo hasn&#x27;t faded in the slightest, it looks as good as the first day I got off the tattooist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li>x) its healing very fast its already pealing and it smooth and the colors still look very fresh worth every penny :D</li>
            <li>I got a tattoo 3days ago and have been using this product and so far it works great :)</li>
            <li>Great product for tattoo aftercare and even helps brighten colors of old tattoos!</li>
            <li>First off the smell is fantastic and it doesn&#x27;t leave/have a greasy feeling, but the best part was it seems to have helped keep the color in the skin during the healing process much</li>
            <li>Does what it says, goes on smooth, nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>Great product so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores so throughout the healing process you can keep your tattoo feeling comfortable while it eliminates itching and scabbing for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with a great deal of natural ingredients and lasts longer on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best ointment for aftercare for new tattoos.</li>
            <li>This is the best for new and older tattoos.</li>
            <li>Many people have recommended Aquaphor or A&amp;D cream for fresh tattoos, but those tend to clog my pores and cause allergic reactions if used for more than a day or so.</li>
            <li>This is good even for older tattoos.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really good on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great when you first get a tattoo, it is very relieving.</li>
            <li>The balm-style of product keeps the tattoo moist while it heals, which is fantastic, and I can always tell when I need more because it is easy to tell when my skin has absorbed it.  </li>
            <li>it was the perfect little addition.</li>
            <li>but if I could make a suggestion by this product from anyone but Big Bens Body Jewerly they lie and refuse refunds the product is great</li>
            <li>You can also after a shower and washing gently with warm water</li>
            <li>fresh ink has never felt better.</li>
            <li>Smells great too, I&#x27;d wear it on my pulse points regularly ha</li>
            <li>and I cannot complain, and looks good so far like I said.</li>
            <li>came super quick, sealed and used right away, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal!</li>
            <li>And it can be used to brighten older tattoos, which is nice if they&#x27;re going to be on display.  </li>
            <li>I got my first tattoo almost 2 weeks ago and its helped alot with the peeling and has also brought out the color in my tattoo alot more</li>
            <li>Came on time, and was worth the money!</li>
            <li>Works great for new tattoos and brightens older ones.  </li>
            <li>Then take a hot or as hot as you can handle compress and apply to the tattoo, continue for 20-25 min re-applying warm compress.</li>
            <li>Have tried several products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Just keeping it clean.</li>
            <li>I love this entire line of products but there is just something amazing about the aftercare Salve.</li>
            <li>and so is Aquaphor, there are other great tricks for tattoos right from the start to help you eliminate all scabbing/peeling or most of it period.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every type of product out there, I started using tattoo Goo about three tattoos ago, it&#x27;s the only thing for a new tattoo, and really moisturizers all your tattoos, don&#x27;t care for the lotion, but the cleaner is good for new ink, also the Goo smells great!</li>
            <li>Could have come in very handy for a 13 hour drive home with a fresh tattoo on my \\&quot;back-</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty good, but i still get a better deal and more for my money with Aquafor which I can buy at Walgreens for less money.</li>
            <li>will order some more real soon.</li>
            <li>no bad smells, no itching, no pain.</li>
            <li>Then wash the tattoo with warm water and something gentle (Aveeno childrens soap etc..natural and no alcohol or too many dyes), dont over work it when washing, then let air dry mostly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to wait until fall to write a more accurate review, new Tat&#x27;s and water don&#x27;t go well together.  </li>
            <li>After the tattoo is healed, it is just as great for chapped lips and other irritations.</li>
            <li>really quick I have about 20 tats</li>
            <li>I just make sure to wash my hands and use hand sanitizer before using the goo, and I don&#x27;t swipe out more goo with the same finger twice.</li>
            <li>Favorite thing to use on my tattoos, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, not near as greasy as most, and being a thicker ointment</li>
            <li>love the product and helps with the healing process of my new tattoo.</li>
            <li>As is usually the case, after the tattooing is done, there is no pain, but the healing process begins and you need to be ready to help it along for the best results of your tattoo.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and doesn&#x27;t smell strongly or get all over your clothes.  </li>
            <li>It seeps well into your skin getting absorbed rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have applied it maybe 5x since I received it last week, my tattoo already looks better!</li>
            <li>My new tattoo is healing so nicely and fast</li>
            <li>It smells great, goes on skill easily, and speeds up healing (at least on my tattoos).</li>
            <li>It actually smells nice, is not greasy and penetrates the skin rather quick.</li>
            <li>Also consider how much you spend on your tattoos, this goo is relatively cheap.  </li>
            <li>, I hear in the beginning regular vitamin e capsules and their oil is also as effective in the healing process, you can switch and use it at night per say.</li>
            <li>I used it on a fresh tattoo and one I already have.  </li>
            <li>I will def buy again its worth it...</li>
            <li>Brightens colors and keeps it looking fresh.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin, and this really helps moisturize it very nicely (which also helps the tattoo stand out).</li>
            <li>Other than that its a good product</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does amazing work for old and new tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t leave my skin all greasy as some other products and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>For the first 2 days, I leave it alone.</li>
            <li>first time I started the tattoo, I did not use the salve.</li>
            <li>bought this for my daughter&#x27;s first tattoo on the recommendation of the artist.  </li>
            <li>Using this product for years since i got my first tatt.</li>
            <li>I got my first tattoo on vacation to the gulf this year.</li>
            <li>For my first tattoos I used A&amp;D Cream thinking there was no problem.  </li>
            <li>Dependable and consistent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more to use as a daily treatment.</li>
            <li>I know most people don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li>After receiveing my first three tattoos.</li>
            <li>He did recommend Aquaphor ointment for the first week and then Palmers Cocoa butter in the tub not lotion.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this helps everyone, use the hot compress method, it works...</li>
            <li>I had used up an &amp;#34;after tattoo&amp;#34; salve I got with my first tattoo.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Tattoo Goo on any of my ink.  </li>
            <li>it definitely makes color stand out more and become darker, so</li>
            <li>pretty-</li>
            <li>I used it when I first got my tattoos</li>
            <li>Doing this achieves the following heal times for me, which will vary slightly person to person based on your health (I consider myself adequately healthy but certainly not in the best shape.)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Also the more time you can give your tattoo to heal naturally, I mean by not having clothing or any layers rub on it as its healing is better, if, and only if you have the ability to be at home walk aroung with it exposed at all times while healing the better.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I use it on my own tattoos, and</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant and it is impossible to put too much on a new tattoo (very important as you don&#x27;t want to smother a healing tattoo).  </li>
            <li>it was overall straight and ok</li>
            <li>I use it the first week or so, it helps heal so much quicker, its soothing, and helps retain the color pigment.  </li>
            <li>I had scab formation, tons of itching, and didn&#x27;t really get to the \\&quot;healed\\&quot; stage until about Day 10, more than twice as long as when I used the Tattoo Goo salve.</li>
            <li>Makes your tattoo always look new!!</li>
            <li>I was able to apply to a full back tattoo once per day for a week, and then with the next tattoo session, another once a day application for 3 days before running out.</li>
            <li>Keeps a fresh tattoo moist (not wet) and gives the skin enough of the vitemins and minerals and what-not it needs to stay healthy.</li>
            <li>it made my sister break out in a rash right over the new tattoo.</li>
            <li>She hates it so much that she will hide the pain and rash from her mom and me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The salve applies gently and evenly</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s applied and gently rubbed/absorbed, you can put your clothes on over it</li>
            <li>It really keeps your tattoo moist so it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>Ok...I really wanted to like this stuff</li>
            <li>Not as I expected..didn&#x27;t really work too well</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>i can keep repeating myself but some people with too much stuff in their ears wont hear me,</li>
            <li>I apply with a finger or 2, and rub it in to my skin gently, thats it.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>It helped heal the tattoo very well and maintain the colors.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for this concentrated, portable item.</li>
            <li>I thought it would go fast, but it has lasted and lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I can&#x27;t really say it was the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I mean it smells nice and seems to keep my fresh ink moisturized and oily.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for me, and is the first ointment I ask for after getting a new tattoo.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly large amount of work done, and the artwork I am currently using it on covers my full calf.</li>
            <li>+ -, some do it for a week +), its still an open wound and needs to be kept clean and needs moisture from the healing ointment (to help heal).</li>
            <li>u actually understand the ingredients, lol and u get alot out of this small tin.</li>
            <li>If you have a new tattoo you run the risk of pulling your skin too much and ripping off the scabs that may have formed.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer H2Ocean&#x27;s 3 step system for new tattoos which I have used on 2 quarter sleeves.</li>
            <li>really well I got a new tattoo</li>
            <li>and it works really well on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li>said, the salve, along with the lotion more than cut the healing time in half so</li>
            <li>The artist said to simply wash with antibacterial soap and apply a mild lotion.</li>
            <li>I still use it on my older tattoos to keep them moisturized.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>First thing in the morning, I apply a coating of the salve over the entire tattoo, gently letting it absorb in, moving with the line; never in a circular motion over them.</li>
            <li>Have no complaint&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Really shows the color of the tattoo better than using just plain old body lotion.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing on a new tattoo,  and keeps my tattoo/skin soft.</li>
            <li>Also use the same gentle soap nothing strong in the shower, dont overscrub, gently wash always, no *hot* water, baths, saunas, pools, oceans etc...</li>
            <li>This helps soothes your new tattoo and relieves the itching from healing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it for new pieces.</li>
            <li>and i can sleep the 1st night of a new tattoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on both new and old tattoos.</li>
            <li>For new or old tattoos it works.</li>
            <li>Always trusted it for my new and old tattoos</li>
            <li>it felt well or like the skin was moisturized properly, it applies extremely easy and you need a thin layer, doesent stain clothes and smells like pine type of smell, nothing too strong, smells</li>
            <li>I decided to try this on a whim after getting a large tattoo finished - I wish I would have tried it earlier!!!  </li>
            <li>Had no scent and worked on my sensitive skin,.</li>
            <li>, so I got It re-touched by Ivy, She said it  was very overworked to the point of scarring, it was pushed in too deep and ended up kinda falling out, so</li>
            <li>for ex: I have a inner bisep tattoo all the way accross, I dont apply with a whole hand?</li>
            <li>The fact that this should also help revive my old ink is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>old tattoos</li>
            <li>if you have those old faded tattoos that you don&#x27;t have time to touch up, this is for you.</li>
            <li>nothing beats this stuff, all natural as far as i know.</li>
            <li>but much easier to open.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy like A&amp;D ointment or Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I have no issues, I got a tattoo by an idiot in Philly PA and the tattoo was a total disaster, it ended up scarring and it faded in many parts, went to Davidian tattoo in Horsham PA, got work done or somewhat covered by Ivy</li>
            <li>The container may look small, but it goes a really long way and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>And if you let it soften a little from the heat of your skin first, it applies so much easier</li>
            <li>It maintains and keeps colors looking new and lasting longer then using nothing.</li>
            <li>use the Yakuza method as its called, turn on the shower on to cold, and let it gently run over the tattoo area, (after the warm shower ofcource, again for the dummies out there) it will close your poores and tighten it up, then gently pat dry and apply the lotion(s)</li>
            <li>the size wasn&#x27;t worth $5 and you can get it for half that from Eternal Inks -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used this on my tattoos and the one I have just gotten looks fabulous after me using it daily as usual.</li>
            <li>I just left it open to air and applied absolutely nothing to the tattoo during the healing process; only washing in in the evenings during my shower.</li>
            <li>Just use a thin layer, its all you need, 3-4 times a day should be ok.</li>
            <li>On Day 8, I evaluate the tattoo (which is now pretty much done itching, no scabbing, and may or may not be shedding the dead skin, ready for the next round of tattooing to begin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a super-nice blackwork knot on the back of my calf, and this makes it really dark and crisp.</li>
            <li>My tattoo artist recommended it when i got my first few tattoos.</li>
            <li>Its a sweet and herbal mix of lavender, cocoa butter, rosemary, olive oil, and a few other herbs.</li>

            <li> This is an excellent product and works wonders when applying to a fresh tattoo, so soothing.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Tattoo Goo for over a dozen years and over a dozen tattoos.</li>
            <li> Works nicely and smells good too.</li>

            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love the Goo!</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is a better choice!</li>
            <li> it felt amazing, almost like putting aloe on a sunburn.</li>
            <li> This Goo is amazing.</li>
            <li> Kept my tattoos moist and nourished, and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> there, she&#x27;s awesome, so far (knock, knock), looks good.</li>
            <li> So nice to tattoo</li>
            <li> he used it on our daughters name scrolled on his bicep---seemed to protect it nicely.</li>
            <li> my tat is nice</li>
            <li> Best stuff for new and healing tattoos!</li>
            <li> Has pleasant fragrance and easy to apply and soothing to skin.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells, love the way it feels!</li>
            <li> the title says, this is the best tattoo protectant/healing salve I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got close to 30 hours of tattooing done so far and this best tattoo aftercare I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the batch so far of the items I&#x27;ve tried for tattoo aftercare.</li>
            <li> The product work&#x27;s great and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I could still use my arm fine, and bending it didn&#x27;t make my healing tattoo crack or bleed!  </li>
            <li> This was especially great in the first couple of months after getting fresh ink.</li>
            <li> I have many tattoos and almost every time I&#x27;ve gotten one, I use this while healing.</li>
            <li> 5-star product for sure, and</li>
            <li> Just be sure to check with your doctor to make sure the salve and lotions are okay for you to use and to ensure you don&#x27;t have any allergies toit.it.</li>
            <li> It heals tattoos brighter than A&amp;D ointment and encourages more healing that just using lotion.  </li>
            <li> It makes even the oldest ones look better.</li>
            <li> Love the earthy, lavender scent.  </li>
            <li> I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for many tattoos and still use it as part of my aftercare.</li>
            <li> It really makes your tattoos look and feel great.</li>
            <li> then the latest work I used this during the healing process.</li>
            <li> and i love the way it looked after I put this stuff on it</li>
            <li> Tattoo goo is a good product, ingredients are mostly all natural stuff, it has sooo many good reviews and alot of tattoo artist&#x27;s recommend it.</li>
            <li> and it got a bit better, before the retouch.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and my tattoos</li>
            <li> love the way it makes them feel (and look!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, will def.</li>
            <li> be buying more again.</li>
            <li> Another reason I love this stuff is that it has vitamin E and lavender oil, which help in the healing process and not all tattoo ointments have those in them.</li>
            <li> I intend to order more...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, nothing works as well, use in place of lip gloss or chap stick.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not as greasy as Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> Great Product Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> Healing was so much better with this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff-</li>
            <li> it makes my tattoos look so healthy and</li>
            <li> sure</li>
            <li> And I love that.</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... doesn&#x27;t stay moisturized on your skin.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it isn&#x27;t greasy so it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes if it gets on them.  </li>
            <li> It is very Soothing &amp; smells great.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t clog pores and smells pretty good to boot.</li>
            <li> , the color in my tattoo hasn&#x27;t faded in the slightest, it looks as good as the first day I got off the tattooist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li> x) its healing very fast its already pealing and it smooth and the colors still look very fresh worth every penny :D</li>
            <li> I got a tattoo 3days ago and have been using this product and so far it works great :)</li>
            <li> Great product for tattoo aftercare and even helps brighten colors of old tattoos!</li>
            <li> First off the smell is fantastic and it doesn&#x27;t leave/have a greasy feeling, but the best part was it seems to have helped keep the color in the skin during the healing process much</li>
            <li> Does what it says, goes on smooth, nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Great product so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores so throughout the healing process you can keep your tattoo feeling comfortable while it eliminates itching and scabbing for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with a great deal of natural ingredients and lasts longer on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best ointment for aftercare for new tattoos.</li>
            <li> This is the best for new and older tattoos.</li>
            <li> Many people have recommended Aquaphor or A&amp;D cream for fresh tattoos, but those tend to clog my pores and cause allergic reactions if used for more than a day or so.</li>
            <li> This is good even for older tattoos.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great when you first get a tattoo, it is very relieving.</li>
            <li> The balm-style of product keeps the tattoo moist while it heals, which is fantastic, and I can always tell when I need more because it is easy to tell when my skin has absorbed it.  </li>
            <li> it was the perfect little addition.</li>
            <li> but if I could make a suggestion by this product from anyone but Big Bens Body Jewerly they lie and refuse refunds the product is great</li>
            <li> You can also after a shower and washing gently with warm water</li>
            <li> fresh ink has never felt better.</li>
            <li> Smells great too, I&#x27;d wear it on my pulse points regularly ha</li>
            <li> and I cannot complain, and looks good so far like I said.</li>
            <li> came super quick, sealed and used right away, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal!</li>
            <li> And it can be used to brighten older tattoos, which is nice if they&#x27;re going to be on display.  </li>
            <li> I got my first tattoo almost 2 weeks ago and its helped alot with the peeling and has also brought out the color in my tattoo alot more</li>
            <li> Came on time, and was worth the money!</li>
            <li> Works great for new tattoos and brightens older ones.  </li>
            <li> Then take a hot or as hot as you can handle compress and apply to the tattoo, continue for 20-25 min re-applying warm compress.</li>
            <li> Have tried several products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Just keeping it clean.</li>
            <li> I love this entire line of products but there is just something amazing about the aftercare Salve.</li>
            <li> and so is Aquaphor, there are other great tricks for tattoos right from the start to help you eliminate all scabbing/peeling or most of it period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every type of product out there, I started using tattoo Goo about three tattoos ago, it&#x27;s the only thing for a new tattoo, and really moisturizers all your tattoos, don&#x27;t care for the lotion, but the cleaner is good for new ink, also the Goo smells great!</li>
            <li> Could have come in very handy for a 13 hour drive home with a fresh tattoo on my \\&quot;back-</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty good, but i still get a better deal and more for my money with Aquafor which I can buy at Walgreens for less money.</li>
            <li> will order some more real soon.</li>
            <li> no bad smells, no itching, no pain.</li>
            <li> Then wash the tattoo with warm water and something gentle (Aveeno childrens soap etc..natural and no alcohol or too many dyes), dont over work it when washing, then let air dry mostly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to wait until fall to write a more accurate review, new Tat&#x27;s and water don&#x27;t go well together.  </li>
            <li> After the tattoo is healed, it is just as great for chapped lips and other irritations.</li>
            <li> really quick I have about 20 tats</li>
            <li> I just make sure to wash my hands and use hand sanitizer before using the goo, and I don&#x27;t swipe out more goo with the same finger twice.</li>
            <li> Favorite thing to use on my tattoos, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth, not near as greasy as most, and being a thicker ointment</li>
            <li> love the product and helps with the healing process of my new tattoo.</li>
            <li> As is usually the case, after the tattooing is done, there is no pain, but the healing process begins and you need to be ready to help it along for the best results of your tattoo.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and doesn&#x27;t smell strongly or get all over your clothes.  </li>
            <li> It seeps well into your skin getting absorbed rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have applied it maybe 5x since I received it last week, my tattoo already looks better!</li>
            <li> My new tattoo is healing so nicely and fast</li>
            <li> It smells great, goes on skill easily, and speeds up healing (at least on my tattoos).</li>
            <li> It actually smells nice, is not greasy and penetrates the skin rather quick.</li>
            <li> Also consider how much you spend on your tattoos, this goo is relatively cheap.  </li>
            <li> , I hear in the beginning regular vitamin e capsules and their oil is also as effective in the healing process, you can switch and use it at night per say.</li>
            <li> I used it on a fresh tattoo and one I already have.  </li>
            <li> I will def buy again its worth it...</li>
            <li> Brightens colors and keeps it looking fresh.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin, and this really helps moisturize it very nicely (which also helps the tattoo stand out).</li>
            <li> Other than that its a good product</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does amazing work for old and new tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my skin all greasy as some other products and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> For the first 2 days, I leave it alone.</li>
            <li> first time I started the tattoo, I did not use the salve.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter&#x27;s first tattoo on the recommendation of the artist.  </li>
            <li> Using this product for years since i got my first tatt.</li>
            <li> I got my first tattoo on vacation to the gulf this year.</li>
            <li> For my first tattoos I used A&amp;D Cream thinking there was no problem.  </li>
            <li> Dependable and consistent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more to use as a daily treatment.</li>
            <li> I know most people don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li> After receiveing my first three tattoos.</li>
            <li> He did recommend Aquaphor ointment for the first week and then Palmers Cocoa butter in the tub not lotion.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this helps everyone, use the hot compress method, it works...</li>
            <li> I had used up an &amp;#34;after tattoo&amp;#34; salve I got with my first tattoo.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Tattoo Goo on any of my ink.  </li>
            <li> it definitely makes color stand out more and become darker, so</li>
            <li> pretty-</li>
            <li> I used it when I first got my tattoos</li>
            <li> Doing this achieves the following heal times for me, which will vary slightly person to person based on your health (I consider myself adequately healthy but certainly not in the best shape.)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Also the more time you can give your tattoo to heal naturally, I mean by not having clothing or any layers rub on it as its healing is better, if, and only if you have the ability to be at home walk aroung with it exposed at all times while healing the better.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I use it on my own tattoos, and</li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasant and it is impossible to put too much on a new tattoo (very important as you don&#x27;t want to smother a healing tattoo).  </li>
            <li> it was overall straight and ok</li>
            <li> I use it the first week or so, it helps heal so much quicker, its soothing, and helps retain the color pigment.  </li>
            <li> I had scab formation, tons of itching, and didn&#x27;t really get to the \\&quot;healed\\&quot; stage until about Day 10, more than twice as long as when I used the Tattoo Goo salve.</li>
            <li> Makes your tattoo always look new!!</li>
            <li> I was able to apply to a full back tattoo once per day for a week, and then with the next tattoo session, another once a day application for 3 days before running out.</li>
            <li> Keeps a fresh tattoo moist (not wet) and gives the skin enough of the vitemins and minerals and what-not it needs to stay healthy.</li>
            <li> it made my sister break out in a rash right over the new tattoo.</li>
            <li> She hates it so much that she will hide the pain and rash from her mom and me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The salve applies gently and evenly</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s applied and gently rubbed/absorbed, you can put your clothes on over it</li>
            <li> It really keeps your tattoo moist so it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> Ok...I really wanted to like this stuff</li>
            <li> Not as I expected..didn&#x27;t really work too well</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> i can keep repeating myself but some people with too much stuff in their ears wont hear me,</li>
            <li> I apply with a finger or 2, and rub it in to my skin gently, thats it.</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> It helped heal the tattoo very well and maintain the colors.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for this concentrated, portable item.</li>
            <li> I thought it would go fast, but it has lasted and lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I can&#x27;t really say it was the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I mean it smells nice and seems to keep my fresh ink moisturized and oily.  </li>
            <li> It works very well for me, and is the first ointment I ask for after getting a new tattoo.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly large amount of work done, and the artwork I am currently using it on covers my full calf.</li>
            <li> + -, some do it for a week +), its still an open wound and needs to be kept clean and needs moisture from the healing ointment (to help heal).</li>
            <li> u actually understand the ingredients, lol and u get alot out of this small tin.</li>
            <li> If you have a new tattoo you run the risk of pulling your skin too much and ripping off the scabs that may have formed.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer H2Ocean&#x27;s 3 step system for new tattoos which I have used on 2 quarter sleeves.</li>
            <li> really well I got a new tattoo</li>
            <li> and it works really well on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li> said, the salve, along with the lotion more than cut the healing time in half so</li>
            <li> The artist said to simply wash with antibacterial soap and apply a mild lotion.</li>
            <li> I still use it on my older tattoos to keep them moisturized.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> First thing in the morning, I apply a coating of the salve over the entire tattoo, gently letting it absorb in, moving with the line; never in a circular motion over them.</li>
            <li> Have no complaint&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Really shows the color of the tattoo better than using just plain old body lotion.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing on a new tattoo,  and keeps my tattoo/skin soft.</li>
            <li> Also use the same gentle soap nothing strong in the shower, dont overscrub, gently wash always, no *hot* water, baths, saunas, pools, oceans etc...</li>
            <li> This helps soothes your new tattoo and relieves the itching from healing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it for new pieces.</li>
            <li> and i can sleep the 1st night of a new tattoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on both new and old tattoos.</li>
            <li> For new or old tattoos it works.</li>
            <li> Always trusted it for my new and old tattoos</li>
            <li> it felt well or like the skin was moisturized properly, it applies extremely easy and you need a thin layer, doesent stain clothes and smells like pine type of smell, nothing too strong, smells</li>
            <li> I decided to try this on a whim after getting a large tattoo finished - I wish I would have tried it earlier!!!  </li>
            <li> Had no scent and worked on my sensitive skin,.</li>
            <li> , so I got It re-touched by Ivy, She said it  was very overworked to the point of scarring, it was pushed in too deep and ended up kinda falling out, so</li>
            <li> for ex: I have a inner bisep tattoo all the way accross, I dont apply with a whole hand?</li>
            <li> The fact that this should also help revive my old ink is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> old tattoos</li>
            <li> if you have those old faded tattoos that you don&#x27;t have time to touch up, this is for you.</li>
            <li> nothing beats this stuff, all natural as far as i know.</li>
            <li> but much easier to open.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy like A&amp;D ointment or Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have no issues, I got a tattoo by an idiot in Philly PA and the tattoo was a total disaster, it ended up scarring and it faded in many parts, went to Davidian tattoo in Horsham PA, got work done or somewhat covered by Ivy</li>
            <li> The container may look small, but it goes a really long way and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> And if you let it soften a little from the heat of your skin first, it applies so much easier</li>
            <li> It maintains and keeps colors looking new and lasting longer then using nothing.</li>
            <li> use the Yakuza method as its called, turn on the shower on to cold, and let it gently run over the tattoo area, (after the warm shower ofcource, again for the dummies out there) it will close your poores and tighten it up, then gently pat dry and apply the lotion(s)</li>
            <li> the size wasn&#x27;t worth $5 and you can get it for half that from Eternal Inks -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this on my tattoos and the one I have just gotten looks fabulous after me using it daily as usual.</li>
            <li> I just left it open to air and applied absolutely nothing to the tattoo during the healing process; only washing in in the evenings during my shower.</li>
            <li> Just use a thin layer, its all you need, 3-4 times a day should be ok.</li>
            <li> On Day 8, I evaluate the tattoo (which is now pretty much done itching, no scabbing, and may or may not be shedding the dead skin, ready for the next round of tattooing to begin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a super-nice blackwork knot on the back of my calf, and this makes it really dark and crisp.</li>
            <li> My tattoo artist recommended it when i got my first few tattoos.</li>
            <li> Its a sweet and herbal mix of lavender, cocoa butter, rosemary, olive oil, and a few other herbs.</li>
            <li> I will wash the tattoo with a soap containing no fragrance, alcohol, or other chemicals that may dry the skin for the first and second night, pat dry, and let it breathe with NOTHING applied to it.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> being a salve, and with some of the other reviews, it was clear to me that this would be a multi-function item.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also notice you don&#x27;t have to apply as frequent as other ointments and rubs in the easiest.</li>
            <li> Personally, its made my tattoos heal much faster than they would usually.</li>
            <li> By Day 4 (just 2 days of using the Tattoo Goo salve) the tattoo is \\&quot;healed\\&quot; in the sense that any scab formation has been prevented and no new scab formation is starting; plus, I have a lot of itching, meaning it&#x27;s in the last stage of healing.</li>
            <li> excelent product.keep dark my old tattoo</li>
            <li> Makes those new tattoos not feel so tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Have gotten several tattoos and used other good quality items, the Goo takes a moment to use because a cold bathroom with firm up the products.</li>
            <li> Let air dry, Then use Aquaphor (which I would recomment for 3-4 days after the tattoo, then I will use tattoo goo), this helps alot in the begining, and follow all the other steps for not picking scabs and no peeling etc, if it even happens in the 1st place, It shouldnt in general.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no difference between buying this brand new in the store or this way, except it was less money!</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to spend $5 on such a small little can of this stuff, but I&#x27;ve had it for a month now</li>
            <li> I also like it for daily care of my other tattoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on a new back tattoo for the past week and a half</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the can will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Was given a small container by our tattoo place and this by far outlasts it.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d be surprised how long such a small little container of it lasts.</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders on my multi-stage back tattoo and cut my healing times from 10-days down to 4-days, giving me plenty of time between my 2-week appointment intervals.</li>
            <li> Some people say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;too expensive&amp;#34;  but a tiny little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> So during the time it needed a healing ointment the most i used almost nothing, I followed directions of this so called 25 year veteran to the \\&quot;T\\&quot;, and it got bad, scabbing, peeling, and the tattoo fade in alot of spots, due to</li>
            <li> Im not sure why some people are not able to think logically???</li>
            <li> I now have some solid black, and am looking forward to see how it looks when I apply it.</li>
            <li> The only con would be how hard it is to open sometimes- I&#x27;ve started not closing it</li>
            <li> It has been one of the most painful experiences of my life</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder to over apply.</li>
            <li> Rough elbows.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of tattoos and have tried a few different aftercare products.  </li>
            <li> Gently wash your tattoo with anti-bacterial soap a few times a day, let the tattoo dry for 15 minutes and then just apply a thin layer of Tattoo Goo.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and Im not sure how big your tattoo is but</li>
            <li> Use this...sparingly...a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about any tattoo aftercare.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes in such a small container</li>
            <li> though I know it&#x27;s recommended for one-person use, I use it on my other sister, too.</li>
            <li> I have other tattoos that I did the conventional ointment route and</li>
            <li> I was using it like 10 days after the tattoo originally done, I was using aveeno moist lotion, this idiot told me to wait 24-48 hours after the tattoo then use the moisturizing aveeno, a totally BS idea.</li>
            <li> but Big Bens Body Jewerly sucks as* thank you for your time</li>
            <li> But you can&#x27;t go wrong with this item, it really brings out your colors in your tattoos.</li>
            <li> Healed my tattoo in half the time.  </li>
            <li> and you end up using less.</li>
            <li> and I have been tore up pretty bad both in and out of the military.</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past before Tattoo Goo don&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product, even after my ink has healed.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to anyone wanting to bring a little pop to their ink.</li>
            <li> I have been using tattoo goo for over 2 years, the peppermint scent takes a little getting use to.</li>
            <li> and I was still shedding dead skin by the time of the appointment...</li>
            <li> So it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> If simply you rub off a thin layer</li>
            <li> In the beginning wash your tattoo a few times a day ( for 3-4 days</li>
            <li> I have a few tins at home for my tattoo needs.</li>
            <li> Also never apply a globb of any stuff, any lotion, its not good at all, it will become too weak or too soft, etc..</li>
            <li> Then it is very hard to get out of such a small tin</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of lip balm...very stiff.  </li>
            <li> , I try to keep it in a room temp place where its not too watery or too stiff.</li>
            <li> When you have a multi-session tattoo going, the artist usually likes to allow for 2-weeks of healing between sessions to reduce the pain and ensure he/</li>
            <li> But not really sure...</li>
            <li> therefore theguy doing it originally is a total jackass,</li>
            <li> It felt like my tattoo was healed in 1/4 of the time it usually takes.  </li>
            <li> my goddaughter has a skin problem that gives her a painful dry heat rash on her inner arm, all we can do is petroleum jelly or A&amp;D, and like me she hates the smell.</li>
            <li> It turns out I&#x27;d applied it too thick and ruined them.  </li>
            <li> so you have to keep dipping into it after each application, but it prevents you from applying it too thick.  </li>
            <li> It had a calming smell, and it wasn&#x27;t heavy to use on the area, like some creams and lotions can be!!  </li>
            <li> I mean thin, then it applies as thin, NO???</li>
            <li> First off it smells like crap!  </li>
            <li> I asked about this product and he was very negative.</li>
            <li> I follow up at around noon with a thin layer of Tattoo Goo lotion and let that absorb in.</li>
            <li> Even my tattoo was crappy earlier by the idiot doing it after applying goo</li>
            <li> then it applies as a thin layer, no???  </li>
            <li> what the idiot that initially F&#x27;d up.</li>
            <li> You can use anything your heart desires, thats a personall choice but to base a balm like this as too thick , which has worked for hundreds of people without any problems as a bad product or something you didnt like makes no sense to me personally.</li>
            <li> ... sorry.</li>
            <li> Applying it to your tattoo is difficult too.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s recommended by all Tattoo artists, so how can they be wrong?</li>
            <li> I felt like i could apply it as liberally as I wanted without having to worry about suffocating my tattoo.  </li>
            <li> makes ny tattoo go numb, which the artist say its impossible but my pain goes away</li>
            <li> I did as told and it scabbed so bad in some spots I lost tons of color!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nasty, so I figured what the check let&#x27;s try</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have many tattoos and almost every time I&#x27;ve gotten one, I use this while healing. Gently wash your tattoo with anti-bacterial soap a few times a day, let the tattoo dry for 15 minutes and then just apply a thin layer of Tattoo Goo.&lt;br /&gt;And no picking or scratching when the tattoo gets itchy and flaky!</li>
            <li> I found the box set at my local megamart after my last tattoo. I DESPISE the smell of A&amp;D, it&#x27;s nasty, so I figured what the check let&#x27;s try it.&lt;br /&gt;1: My tattoo was a cover up and had taken some damage on my way home from the shop, after using this it felt amazing, almost like putting aloe on a sunburn. My tattoo healed in about 9 days rather than the 3 weeks I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;2: my goddaughter has a skin problem that gives her a painful dry heat rash on her inner arm, all we can do is petroleum jelly or A&amp;D, and like me she hates the smell. She hates it so much that she will hide the pain and rash from her mom and me. We talked to her Dr and she can use this for almost the same reasons as our tattoos. Talk about a house hold product.</li>
            <li> *** OVERVIEW ***&lt;br /&gt;I recently started work on a full-back tattoo that I have wanted for years now. It has been one of the most painful experiences of my life and I have been tore up pretty bad both in and out of the military. As is usually the case, after the tattooing is done, there is no pain, but the healing process begins and you need to be ready to help it along for the best results of your tattoo. Here is what I have been doing, and what my healing times are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** APPLICATION ***&lt;br /&gt;The salve applies gently and evenly and you&#x27;d be surprised how long such a small little container of it lasts. I was able to apply to a full back tattoo once per day for a week, and then with the next tattoo session, another once a day application for 3 days before running out. The key is to use it sparingly so as to allow the tattoo to breathe. Once it&#x27;s applied and gently rubbed/absorbed, you can put your clothes on over it and it&#x27;s protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** MY REGIMEN ***&lt;br /&gt;I use a combination of this salve, along with Tattoo Goo&#x27;s lotion. Here&#x27;s what I do:&lt;br /&gt;1. For the first 2 days, I leave it alone. I will wash the tattoo with a soap containing no fragrance, alcohol, or other chemicals that may dry the skin for the first and second night, pat dry, and let it breathe with NOTHING applied to it.&lt;br /&gt;2. On Day 3 is when I begin using the Tattoo Goo salve and lotion. First thing in the morning, I apply a coating of the salve over the entire tattoo, gently letting it absorb in, moving with the line; never in a circular motion over them. I follow up at around noon with a thin layer of Tattoo Goo lotion and let that absorb in. In the evening, I use another application of the lotion, and again, let it absorb into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. I repeat this process every day for days 3 through 7 (5 days total.) Doing this achieves the following heal times for me, which will vary slightly person to person based on your health (I consider myself adequately healthy but certainly not in the best shape.)&lt;br /&gt;4. HEAL TIMES: By Day 4 (just 2 days of using the Tattoo Goo salve) the tattoo is \\&quot;healed\\&quot; in the sense that any scab formation has been prevented and no new scab formation is starting; plus, I have a lot of itching, meaning it&#x27;s in the last stage of healing. I continue to use the salve in the morning and the lotion throughout the day for days 5-7. On Day 8, I evaluate the tattoo (which is now pretty much done itching, no scabbing, and may or may not be shedding the dead skin, ready for the next round of tattooing to begin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** COMPARED TO NOT USING THE SALVE ***&lt;br /&gt;The first time I started the tattoo, I did not use the salve. I just left it open to air and applied absolutely nothing to the tattoo during the healing process; only washing in in the evenings during my shower. I had scab formation, tons of itching, and didn&#x27;t really get to the \\&quot;healed\\&quot; stage until about Day 10, more than twice as long as when I used the Tattoo Goo salve. When you have a multi-session tattoo going, the artist usually likes to allow for 2-weeks of healing between sessions to reduce the pain and ensure he/she doesn&#x27;t overdo it. Not using the salve put me just days away from my next session (2-weeks) and I was still shedding dead skin by the time of the appointment... not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said, the salve, along with the lotion more than cut the healing time in half so I will continue to use it for the rest of my sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** CONCLUSION ***&lt;br /&gt;As the title says, this is the best tattoo protectant/healing salve I have used so far. It has worked wonders on my multi-stage back tattoo and cut my healing times from 10-days down to 4-days, giving me plenty of time between my 2-week appointment intervals. 5-star product for sure, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone getting tattooed. Just be sure to check with your doctor to make sure the salve and lotions are okay for you to use and to ensure you don&#x27;t have any allergies toit.it.</li>
            <li> this product  kicks as* heals your tattoos really quick I have about 20 tats and this is the best product I have ever used but if I could make a suggestion by this product from anyone but Big Bens Body Jewerly they lie and refuse refunds the product is great but Big Bens Body Jewerly sucks as* thank you for your time</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter&#x27;s first tattoo on the recommendation of the artist.  this stuff really works and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My tatts looks ooh soo good wit the tatoo goo.. ..</li>
            <li> must buy when getting a tattoo</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great customer service !!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic in a tin! My new tattoo is healing so nicely and fast, it&#x27;s incredible. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Had no scent and worked on my sensitive skin,.</li>
            <li> The product work&#x27;s great and the price was right.Have no complaint&#x27;s. I will do business again.Thank&#x27;s you very much for a good deal!!</li>
            <li> Works great for new tattoos and brightens older ones.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> good price and value....worked great on my tat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Tattoo Goo on 9 of my 11 tattoos, and they all look great! It heals tattoos brighter than A&amp;D ointment and encourages more healing that just using lotion.  The balm-style of product keeps the tattoo moist while it heals, which is fantastic, and I can always tell when I need more because it is easy to tell when my skin has absorbed it.  Plus, it smells great! And it can be used to brighten older tattoos, which is nice if they&#x27;re going to be on display.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Using this product for years since i got my first tatt. Works wonders, I use it from time to time, as a \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; for my tatts, (kinda like a hair cut or day at the spa). Not changing my product... sorry. A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> I got my first tattoo on vacation to the gulf this year. The artist said to simply wash with antibacterial soap and apply a mild lotion. I did as told and it scabbed so bad in some spots I lost tons of color! I asked about this product and he was very negative. Knowing what I do now, I will never get another without this stuff!!! It is awesome!!! It is so great I have gotten several friends with tat&#x27;s of all ages to use it. It makes even the oldest ones look better. It won&#x27;t clog pores and smells pretty good to boot. I only wish I had tried it sooner! Could have come in very handy for a 13 hour drive home with a fresh tattoo on my \\&quot;back-side\\&quot;. A MUST HAVE for anyone with tattoos. LOVE IT!!!!!  Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love the earthy, lavender scent.  I have been using this on my oldest and newest tat and prefer it to lotion.  A little goes a long way and the can will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stuff contrary to my tattoo artist&#x27;s opinion. He said it was just a gimic. I love the stuff. Tattoo Goo works as it says it should. I have a fairly large amount of work done, and the artwork I am currently using it on covers my full calf. I have no complaints, and I will contunue to use it on all my future work.</li>
            <li> excelent product.keep dark my old tattoo</li>
            <li> I decided to try this on a whim after getting a large tattoo finished - I wish I would have tried it earlier!!!  It really keeps your tattoo moist so it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  This was especially helpful for me as my tattoo was on the inside of my elbow!  I could still use my arm fine, and bending it didn&#x27;t make my healing tattoo crack or bleed!  Definitely check this stuff out!</li>
            <li> does what it says its gonna do</li>
            <li> For my first tattoos I used A&amp;D Cream thinking there was no problem.  It turns out I&#x27;d applied it too thick and ruined them.  I ordered some Tattoo Goo for my touch-up and it&#x27;s great stuff.  It takes some time to apply because it&#x27;s a balm so you have to keep dipping into it after each application, but it prevents you from applying it too thick.  It is very soothing and doesn&#x27;t smell strongly or get all over your clothes.  Definitely buy this for your tattoos!</li>
            <li> Ok...I really wanted to like this stuff BUT....thats not the case.  First off it smells like crap!  Then it is very hard to get out of such a small tin - you can only use one finger.  It has the consistency of lip balm...very stiff.  Applying it to your tattoo is difficult too.  If you have a new tattoo you run the risk of pulling your skin too much and ripping off the scabs that may have formed.  I much prefer H2Ocean&#x27;s 3 step system for new tattoos which I have used on 2 quarter sleeves.</li>
            <li> Rock solid product.  I love it.  Dependable and consistent.  I have used this for many tattoos and still use it as part of my aftercare.</li>
            <li> This helps soothes your new tattoo and relieves the itching from healing.  I also like it for daily care of my other tattoo.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as an alternative to using Aquaphor. It really makes your tattoos look and feel great. I&#x27;m ordering more to use as a daily treatment.</li>
            <li> This is good even for older tattoos. It brings out the color and keeps skin moist.</li>
            <li> But not really sure... I mean it smells nice and seems to keep my fresh ink moisturized and oily.  And it&#x27;s recommended by all Tattoo artists, so how can they be wrong?</li>
            <li> This Goo is amazing. I know most people don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary. I get that, but that just shows they haven&#x27;t tried this. I have other tattoos that I did the conventional ointment route and then the latest work I used this during the healing process. First off the smell is fantastic and it doesn&#x27;t leave/have a greasy feeling, but the best part was it seems to have helped keep the color in the skin during the healing process much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely using this for all the future work that I get.</li>
            <li> Have gotten several tattoos and used other good quality items, the Goo takes a moment to use because a cold bathroom with firm up the products. Just rub a finger around and get it moving - smells great, not sticky, feels great.</li>
            <li> After receiveing my first three tattoos. I needed a balm that wouldn&#x27;t take the color away from it, and something that would not cause me to have an allergic reaction in that area of my body!! This was the perfect solution!!! It had a calming smell, and it wasn&#x27;t heavy to use on the area, like some creams and lotions can be!!  Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well I got a new tattoo and i love the way it looked after I put this stuff on it keeps it from drying out.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best ointment for aftercare for new tattoos. I use it the first week or so, it helps heal so much quicker, its soothing, and helps retain the color pigment.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it for new pieces.</li>
            <li> I got a tattoo 3days ago and have been using this product and so far it works great :) I noticed it soothes the burning feeling afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t feel like i just got a tattoo x) its healing very fast its already pealing and it smooth and the colors still look very fresh worth every penny :D</li>
            <li> I told the Tattoo Artist about my purchase and he said not to use Tattoo GOO that it&#x27;s trash.He did recommend Aquaphor ointment for the first week and then Palmers Cocoa butter in the tub not lotion. So it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  The smell is amazing!  Healed my tattoo in half the time.  I still use it on my older tattoos to keep them moisturized.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected..didn&#x27;t really work too well</li>
            <li> arrived on time. i added this tattoo goo tin to my order last inute. it was the perfect little addition. thanks</li>
            <li> The best Goo to aid in healing your tattoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to wait until fall to write a more accurate review, new Tat&#x27;s and water don&#x27;t go well together.  I did stop by the local shop and inquired about my purchase and I was told it would work well.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have no issues, I got a tattoo by an idiot in Philly PA and the tattoo was a total disaster, it ended up scarring and it faded in many parts, went to Davidian tattoo in Horsham PA, got work done or somewhat covered by Ivy there, she&#x27;s awesome, so far (knock, knock), looks good. Eventhough she didnt recomment goo to me and advised me to use aquaphor, I will use it after 3-4 days of using aquaphor. I was using it like 10 days after the tattoo originally done, I was using aveeno moist lotion, this idiot told me to wait 24-48 hours after the tattoo then use the moisturizing aveeno, a totally BS idea. So during the time it needed a healing ointment the most i used almost nothing, I followed directions of this so called 25 year veteran to the \\&quot;T\\&quot;, and it got bad, scabbing, peeling, and the tattoo fade in alot of spots, due to it was lettering it was overall straight and ok just faded, so I got It re-touched by Ivy, She said it  was very overworked to the point of scarring, it was pushed in too deep and ended up kinda falling out, so therefore theguy doing it originally is a total jackass, Ivy at Davidian did a great jog and I cannot complain, and looks good so far like I said. Hopefully if it does peel and scabb its the regular stuff thats supposed to happen anyway and the ink under the skin that fades out comes back in. Tattoo goo is a good product, ingredients are mostly all natural stuff, it has sooo many good reviews and alot of tattoo artist&#x27;s recommend it. Even my tattoo was crappy earlier by the idiot doing it after applying goo I saw a difference in the color and it got a bit better, before the retouch. it felt well or like the skin was moisturized properly, it applies extremely easy and you need a thin layer, doesent stain clothes and smells like pine type of smell, nothing too strong, smells fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**In regards to a review stating its too stiff***&lt;br /&gt;It may be a stiffer formula but if kept in room temperature would spread just fineyou just have to be a gentler, To me its no stiffer than regular Aquaphor, If simply you rub off a thin layer I mean thin, then it applies as thin, NO??? then it applies as a thin layer, no???  i can keep repeating myself but some people with too much stuff in their ears wont hear me, Im not sure why some people are not able to think logically??? Also the can works well with being on the go (easy to keep ina pocket, lol! for the dummies) and Im not sure how big your tattoo is but for ex: I have a inner bisep tattoo all the way accross, I dont apply with a whole hand? I apply with a finger or 2, and rub it in to my skin gently, thats it. You can use anything your heart desires, thats a personall choice but to base a balm like this as too thick , which has worked for hundreds of people without any problems as a bad product or something you didnt like makes no sense to me personally. Before I make a review I think and read reviews to see people dealing with similar issue where I might learn something to help me use the product (and ask questions). Other than that its a good product and so is Aquaphor, there are other great tricks for tattoos right from the start to help you eliminate all scabbing/peeling or most of it period. Here is what I recommend:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when getting a tattoo, leave the plastic or cover that the artist left on there for 2-3 hrs. Then wash the tattoo with warm water and something gentle (Aveeno childrens soap etc..natural and no alcohol or too many dyes), dont over work it when washing, then let air dry mostly. Then take a hot or as hot as you can handle compress and apply to the tattoo, continue for 20-25 min re-applying warm compress. Let air dry, Then use Aquaphor (which I would recomment for 3-4 days after the tattoo, then I will use tattoo goo), this helps alot in the begining, and follow all the other steps for not picking scabs and no peeling etc, if it even happens in the 1st place, It shouldnt in general. Also use the same gentle soap nothing strong in the shower, dont overscrub, gently wash always, no *hot* water, baths, saunas, pools, oceans etc... You can also after a shower and washing gently with warm water use the Yakuza method as its called, turn on the shower on to cold, and let it gently run over the tattoo area, (after the warm shower ofcource, again for the dummies out there) it will close your poores and tighten it up, then gently pat dry and apply the lotion(s), I hear in the beginning regular vitamin e capsules and their oil is also as effective in the healing process, you can switch and use it at night per say. Also the more time you can give your tattoo to heal naturally, I mean by not having clothing or any layers rub on it as its healing is better, if, and only if you have the ability to be at home walk aroung with it exposed at all times while healing the better. Thats the best way. Also never apply a globb of any stuff, any lotion, its not good at all, it will become too weak or too soft, etc.. Just use a thin layer, its all you need, 3-4 times a day should be ok. In the beginning wash your tattoo a few times a day ( for 3-4 days + -, some do it for a week +), its still an open wound and needs to be kept clean and needs moisture from the healing ointment (to help heal). Hopefully this helps everyone, use the hot compress method, it works...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE,,,10/24/2013**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Goo for almost 2 weeks now after using the Aquaphor for the 1st 4 days after the tattoo/touchup. Works great, color looks better, Ivy did an awesome job touching up what the idiot that initially F&#x27;d up. Goo works great, no break outs, And I break out very easily from any greasy stuff, I try to keep it in a room temp place where its not too watery or too stiff. Helps in applying. Great product so far.</li>
            <li> The best stuff for tattoos!</li>
            <li> Tattoo Goo is my best friend. I love the scent and my tattoos love the way it makes them feel (and look!)&lt;br /&gt;Though any A&amp;D ointment will do the trick, something about this salve screams A MILLION TIMES BETTER!&lt;br /&gt;My fresh ink has never felt better.</li>
            <li> I have a super-nice blackwork knot on the back of my calf, and this makes it really dark and crisp. I have pretty dry skin, and this really helps moisturize it very nicely (which also helps the tattoo stand out).</li>
            <li> Nice, very nice seller</li>
            <li> I had used up an &amp;#34;after tattoo&amp;#34; salve I got with my first tattoo. Heard about this,  and decided to give it a try. It is very soothing on a new tattoo,  and keeps my tattoo/skin soft.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Tattoo Goo on any of my ink.  I was really, really impressed.  It felt like my tattoo was healed in 1/4 of the time it usually takes.  I felt like i could apply it as liberally as I wanted without having to worry about suffocating my tattoo.  Kept my tattoos moist and nourished, and smells amazing.  Some people say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;too expensive&amp;#34;  but a tiny little bit goes a long way.  I bought 2 of this size and only ended up using 1.  Also consider how much you spend on your tattoos, this goo is relatively cheap.  Protect your investment, use tattoo goo.</li>
            <li> So nice to tattoo I like it so much</li>
            <li> This is the good stuff. Finally good to see it sold online. I use it on all of my tattoos.</li>
            <li> came super quick, sealed and used right away, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal! There was absolutely no difference between buying this brand new in the store or this way, except it was less money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got close to 30 hours of tattooing done so far and this best tattoo aftercare I&#x27;ve ever used. After my last tattoo my tattoo artist gave me some H2Ocean Aquatat, which I decided to try since my Tattoo Goo hadn&#x27;t arrived yet and the H2Ocean made my leg break out so went back to the Tattoo Goo. Other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past before Tattoo Goo don&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> best thing to heal tattoos</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells, love the way it feels! I think I look forward to getting tattoos just so I can use this (LOL). After the tattoo is healed, it is just as great for chapped lips and other irritations. Use this...sparingly...a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, will def. be buying more again. Great value for the money. Was given a small container by our tattoo place and this by far outlasts it. Makes your tattoo always look new!!</li>
            <li> Favorite thing to use on my tattoos, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The best salve for tattoo&#x27;s on the market.</li>
            <li> Works as good as everyone says, no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on a new back tattoo for the past week and a half, the color in my tattoo hasn&#x27;t faded in the slightest, it looks as good as the first day I got off the tattooist&#x27;s chair. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I have applied it maybe 5x since I received it last week, my tattoo already looks better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every type of product out there, I started using tattoo Goo about three tattoos ago, it&#x27;s the only thing for a new tattoo, and really moisturizers all your tattoos, don&#x27;t care for the lotion, but the cleaner is good for new ink, also the Goo smells great!</li>
            <li> very nice product and great price. Came on time too. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> he used it on our daughters name scrolled on his bicep---seemed to protect it nicely.</li>
            <li> I will never use another product when I get a tattoo. This product has been around for quite a while now but I had never used it until Igot my last tattoo. It helped heal the tattoo very well and maintain the colors. Didn&#x27;t leave my skin all greasy as some other products and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Have tried several products and this is by far the best. I&#x27;ve used it on both new and old tattoos. It helps heal faster than most products, smells the best, feels the best and brightens old tattoos the best. I also notice you don&#x27;t have to apply as frequent as other ointments and rubs in the easiest. It&#x27;s very smooth, not near as greasy as most, and being a thicker ointment it&#x27;s harder to over apply. And if you let it soften a little from the heat of your skin first, it applies so much easier and you end up using less. Another reason I love this stuff is that it has vitamin E and lavender oil, which help in the healing process and not all tattoo ointments have those in them. Will never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and works wonders when applying to a fresh tattoo, so soothing. I intend to order more...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I got my first tattoo almost 2 weeks ago and its helped alot with the peeling and has also brought out the color in my tattoo alot more</li>
            <li> Really great product! I&#x27;ve used it every time I&#x27;ve gotten any work done! Personally, its made my tattoos heal much faster than they would usually. Would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the batch so far of the items I&#x27;ve tried for tattoo aftercare. The fact that this should also help revive my old ink is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;This being a salve, and with some of the other reviews, it was clear to me that this would be a multi-function item. Cuticles. Lips. Eyebrow tamer. Rough elbows. I&#x27;m on board. In fact, I&#x27;m so on board that I put the Tattoo Goo Healing and Sun Care Kit on my subscribe and save order.&lt;br /&gt;The herbal aroma works for me. The moisture level keeps this 50 year-old skin happy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews complaining about the size. The price is reasonable for this concentrated, portable item.</li>
            <li> Used this from day one of getting my tattoo. Keeps tattoo moist and prevents scabbing. My tattoo was fully healed in just three days of using this product. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of tattoos and have tried a few different aftercare products.  This is the best product, bar none.  I always go back to Tattoo Goo.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty good, but i still get a better deal and more for my money with Aquafor which I can buy at Walgreens for less money. Overall, it did its job, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product anymore.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about any tattoo aftercare. I&#x27;ve never used any product before, but this ointment work great. It actually does bring some life into your ink. It makes the colors pop. I now have some solid black, and am looking forward to see how it looks when I apply it. I will continue to use this product, even after my ink has healed.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to anyone wanting to bring a little pop to their ink.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, nothing works as well, use in place of lip gloss or chap stick.</li>
            <li> It maintains and keeps colors looking new and lasting longer then using nothing. Has pleasant fragrance and easy to apply and soothing to skin.</li>
            <li> Makes those new tattoos not feel so tight and dry. Works nicely and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this on my tattoos and the one I have just gotten looks fabulous after me using it daily as usual. Smells great too, I&#x27;d wear it on my pulse points regularly ha</li>
            <li> Many people have recommended Aquaphor or A&amp;D cream for fresh tattoos, but those tend to clog my pores and cause allergic reactions if used for more than a day or so. Tattoo goo is a great alternative that won&#x27;t ruin clothes with greasy stains. It smells great, goes on skill easily, and speeds up healing (at least on my tattoos). I have a few tins at home for my tattoo needs.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes in such a small container I thought it would go fast, but it has lasted and lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to do great for keeping your tattoo nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to spend $5 on such a small little can of this stuff, but I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and it works really well on my new tattoo. I love that it&#x27;s not as greasy as Aquaphor. I would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> This product is amazoning anyone with tattoos should be using this products. For new or old tattoos it works. My colores have not fade they look just like I got the tat.</li>
            <li> Great Product Highly Recommended! YBEAR</li>
            <li> I would recommend Tattoo Goo to anyone, no matter the skin type.&lt;br /&gt;It does amazing work for old and new tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores so throughout the healing process you can keep your tattoo feeling comfortable while it eliminates itching and scabbing for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with old tattoos it definitely makes color stand out more and become darker, so if you have those old faded tattoos that you don&#x27;t have time to touch up, this is for you.</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff.  I used it on a fresh tattoo and one I already have.  Really shows the color of the tattoo better than using just plain old body lotion.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of tattoo artists say this isn&#x27;t legit, but it feels like it works, and for the price I got it for, that&#x27;s a lot of piece of mind. This was especially great in the first couple of months after getting fresh ink.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. My 3rd order .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product. Does what it says, goes on smooth, nice clean scent. Not sticky or slimy. My tattoo looks great after using it. Healing was so much better with this. I&#x27;ll never go without it,</li>
            <li> Great product for tattoo aftercare and even helps brighten colors of old tattoos! Came on time, and was worth the money!</li>
            <li> ive been using tattoo goo for years, and yes ive tried over brands. nothing beats this stuff, all natural as far as i know. u actually understand the ingredients, lol and u get alot out of this small tin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff- it makes my tattoos look so healthy and pretty- And it smells amazing. The only con would be how hard it is to open sometimes- I&#x27;ve started not closing it all the way so it&#x27;s still not letting air in but much easier to open.</li>
            <li> It works well for tattoo&#x27;s...sure but it works  great on cuts and brush burns. Price was amazing!  It seeps well into your skin getting absorbed rather quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the Goo! Always trusted it for my new and old tattoos just seems to bring them to life! And I love that. Great product and will probably use them till I die :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this balm/salve for years now. My tattoo artist recommended it when i got my first few tattoos. Nowadays I use it for skin rashes, sunburn etc. works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE the smell of this stuff. Its a sweet and herbal mix of lavender, cocoa butter, rosemary, olive oil, and a few other herbs.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for new and healing tattoos!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great when you first get a tattoo, it is very relieving. It stops itching for awhile and goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I can&#x27;t say that it does anything for bringing out color. I am african american and have deep brown colored skin. It does prevent my tattoos from looking \\&quot;faded\\&quot; though.</li>
            <li> Soothing ointment that smells good, too. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I got this as a $5 add-on when I bought my tattoo kit. It does its job. Keeps a fresh tattoo moist (not wet) and gives the skin enough of the vitemins and minerals and what-not it needs to stay healthy. My only issues are 1) the size wasn&#x27;t worth $5 and you can get it for half that from Eternal Inks - though you pay s/h - and 2) it made my sister break out in a rash right over the new tattoo. Though I can&#x27;t really say it was the product&#x27;s fault. It just let us know that she is allergic to lavender, and this stuff has lavender oil in it. So double-check what&#x27;s in the goo, and take note of any allergies you or your &amp;#34;clients&amp;#34; might have before applying this. Other than that, I use it on my own tattoos, and though I know it&#x27;s recommended for one-person use, I use it on my other sister, too. I just make sure to wash my hands and use hand sanitizer before using the goo, and I don&#x27;t swipe out more goo with the same finger twice. Just keeping it clean.</li>
            <li> I love this entire line of products but there is just something amazing about the aftercare Salve. It&#x27;s not messy like A&amp;D ointment or Aquaphor. It&#x27;s made with a great deal of natural ingredients and lasts longer on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... doesn&#x27;t stay moisturized on your skin. Aquaphor is a better choice!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Tattoo goo from my Tattoo Artist and after two appliations I was sold. I will continue to use this product even after my tattoo is healed. It actually smells nice, is not greasy and penetrates the skin rather quick.</li>
            <li> This is the best for new and older tattoos. The smell is very pleasant and it is impossible to put too much on a new tattoo (very important as you don&#x27;t want to smother a healing tattoo).  The container may look small, but it goes a really long way and is very easy to apply. I also love the fact that it isn&#x27;t greasy so it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes if it gets on them.  I used it when I first got my tattoos and I still use it to keep them looking good. The best!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works awsome my tat is nice kept the color bright... I will def buy again its worth it...</li>
            <li> Tried the A &amp; D ointment. I&#x27;ve tried aquaphor. Tattoo Goo is the way to go. Relieves some of the itch and the scent is quite pleasant. Brightens colors and keeps it looking fresh.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me, and is the first ointment I ask for after getting a new tattoo.It is very Soothing &amp; smells great. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to keep some bacatracin on hand as an antibiotic (as well as some A&amp;D ointment for further healing later in the healing process) but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Tattoo Goo for over a dozen years and over a dozen tattoos.</li>
            <li> no bad smells, no itching, no pain. if you&#x27;re allergic/sensitive to petroleum or lanolin, get Tattoo Goo... good stuff, y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li> will order some more real soon. love the product and helps with the healing process of my new tattoo. thanks</li>
            <li> Have a sleeve done &amp; this is a life saver makes ny tattoo go numb, which the artist say its impossible but my pain goes away and i can sleep the 1st night of a new tattoo. (:  highly recommend</li>
            <li> Good product, good shipping speed.</li>
            <li> I have been using tattoo goo for over 2 years, the peppermint scent takes a little getting use to. But you can&#x27;t go wrong with this item, it really brings out your colors in your tattoos.</li>
