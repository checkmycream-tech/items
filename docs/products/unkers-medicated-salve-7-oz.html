            <li>does a good job on foot pain.</li>
            <li>This is good for sinuses as well as arthritic pain.  </li>
            <li>It feels good, yes, but pain relief does not occur.</li>
            <li>it does NOT have that overwhelming  odor which is great if you need to rub some on and go....</li>
            <li>And at this price, it better than a doctor&#x27;s visit that won&#x27;t help you any!</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I thought this would be wonderful to rub on, instead of always reaching for Ibuprofen. First-</li>

            <li>Amazon.com...can offer it at a rather nice savings...</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like a cough drop or mentholatum (sp).  </li>
            <li>Excellent for fast relief of muscle and joint pain.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I liked rubbing the smelly salve on and around my head, but it did help quite a bit.</li>
            <li>very good for all  kinds of stiffness,  and sore throat, an  excellent rub when you are tired from  doing too much,  good for chest  colds.</li>
            <li>The odor of this product is not an offensive one, but kind of refreshing when inhaled.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this, as it had some good reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for so many uses like bug bites, light burns.</li>

            <li>It heals and takes away callouses, and headaches, pain in shoulders and more.</li>
            <li>perfect for any external ailment.</li>
            <li>but it made it much more bearable.  </li>
            <li>Added bonus, the vick&#x27;s smell covered up the funk of 4 people in a truck for 13 hours :)  </li>
            <li>This works better than any product my husband &amp; I have tried, even a written compound prescription from our doctor.</li>
            <li>Love Unker&#x27;s.</li>

            <li>i just love unkers, i use to sell the product</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li>Have already purchased more.</li>
            <li>Suggested to several people &amp; they were impressed with results!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This stuff was recommended by a friend of mine and it works for everything and think its better than vicks or for any muscle aches.</li>
            <li>Love that it can be used for all it says.  </li>
            <li>It eases pain or eliminates it in most everything I&amp;#34;ve used it for.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Even if you want to sleep better at night.  </li>
            <li>I love it already.</li>
            <li>It is better than those products at the pharmacies.</li>
            <li>We are pleased with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>I am always pleased with the results I get from using Uncker&#x27;s and will continue to recommend it to anyone having certain kinds of pain as listed on the jar and more!!  </li>
            <li>gay unkers stays hot strong and smells good</li>
            <li>I use in on my feet to keep them smooth, better than any lotion I have used.  </li>
            <li>Want a good nights sleep, then you really need to buy this product.</li>
            <li>Unkers is such a good product!</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the original formula with camphor , eucalyptus and menthol</li>
            <li>product came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>better.unlike ben gay</li>
            <li>I was told that it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>also has a mild pleasing scent that doesn&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; to anyone within 25 feet!</li>
            <li>After yoga and some time at the gym, this felt great on my aching back and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I use it every night &amp; can sleep pain free.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I did not assume it would take away ALL pain, but help significantly - nothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have passed it on to many friends who also think it&#x27;s wonderful, especially for sore joints, muscle, back &amp; neck pain.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered Unker&#x27;s at an Amish Store in Fredericksburg, TX and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>We tried this originally from a relative when visiting Ohio and found it very helpful for aches and pains, so when we ran out we ordered more and think it is great.</li>
            <li>Unker&#x27;s clears them and significantly reduces the associated itchiness.</li>
            <li>It also felt cool on, but did NOTHING - zero- for any pain relief.</li>
            <li>but when I&#x27;m home and really need relief, its what I can count on more than national  brands I got at a store.</li>
            <li>and she wasn&#x27;t sure that it really eased her foot pain.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>When compared to Sombra, the latter is superior in quality and function.</li>
            <li>and I use it as such with good results.</li>
            <li>it came in super quick with a super price</li>
            <li>This salve works better than the high priced ointments on the market.</li>
            <li>its my new favorite things in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I have suggested it to several friends who love it!</li>
            <li>I was happy with the results, but I was expecting it to be a little stronger on the aches.</li>
            <li>Rub it on the soles of your feet to calm a cough and rub on your sinuses to ease congetsion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been an old family favorite for years.</li>
            <li>I ordered for a friend and decided to get one for myself since this 90 Year old friend said it works for most anything!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>so it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Actually felt nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best kept secret for purchase over the counter pharmacy items</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t find it quite so effective, so the five star rating is based on my wife&#x27;s opinion.</li>
            <li>I use it for colds, sinus problems, bruises, and many many other things.  </li>
            <li>Husband loves this product and this is a good buy comparing to other places you can buy it.  </li>
            <li>Right on time.</li>
            <li>I used it right away the moment I received it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will have more things down the road to try it on,</li>
            <li>The hives stopped itching and hurting right away, the cooling sensation was a blessing and the hives were gone very fast.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and effective for a strained back and works well on insect bites.</li>
            <li>i first heard of unkers 3yrs ago</li>
            <li>only is unkers better</li>
            <li>It works for so many different ailments!!!</li>
            <li>This is a must have in the first aid cabinet.</li>
            <li>The tine spand for using it has been very short for a more exact rating.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for sending it so promptly and its the real deal!</li>
            <li>We first found it in a Mennonite store in Ohio.</li>
            <li>My first choice for arthritic pain for years</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t purchase locally anympre, so we are glad I can get it here</li>
            <li>I order more everytime the jar gets low.</li>
            <li>A funny (kinda) story...</li>
            <li>Appreciated receiving the Unker&#x27;s Medicated Salve and have used it a number of times already!  </li>
            <li>This is better than current Vick&#x27;s vapor rub you can buy at the store!</li>
            <li>started out good, helping my sore skin from shingles pain, but after a few weeks started burning.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and the pain goes away within a few minutes after rubbing it on.</li>
            <li>It has been nice to have some relief from my daily headaches, but my new Unker&#x27;s perfume might take awhile to catch on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for many things and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that that the odor is rather strong.</li>
            <li>A large bottle lasts us a couple of years.</li>
            <li>but since i am not working i do not have the large clientele anymore.  </li>
            <li>this unkers product holds the heat in and stays the same for 8 or 9 hours,unlike ben gay on for bout an 1hr or so.not</li>
            <li>Product is very greasy and I&#x27;m finding that it does t work at all.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Item just as described Fast Ship</li>
            <li>Really like this product, have used it for years.</li>
            <li>Really like this medication.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This product really works...</li>
            <li>Stunk up the whole house</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>We will be ordering more as soon as this jar is getting empty.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>ever!i was using on mussles and seen where it was used for many other things.if you like ben gay or icy hot</li>
            <li>People in general, laugh at how I always say “You’ve got to try Unkers”.</li>
            <li>I have used UNKER&#x27;S for many years and it has never let me down.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you just have to stick with the older remedies.</li>
            <li>The main reason for the 4 stars and not 5 was that the texture of the ointment is like petroleum jelly</li>
            <li>Not only for all the things it says on the label, but when my chest is hurting or my glands in my neck hurt, I rub some Unker&#x27;s on over night, and the next day I am much better.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so when I read the reviews for this, I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>AWSOME for MULTIPLE things my whole family loves it!!</li>
            <li>He used a whole jar of Unkers because it helped ease the   pain considerably.</li>
            <li>that even a doctor prescribed steroid cream wasn&#x27;t helping that now thanks to Unkers is completely gone.</li>
            <li>Use only a little bit under the nose for congestion, it is very strong.</li>
            <li>Myself, family and friends love this product, but the jars are getting smaller and more expensive.</li>
            <li>first picked it up locally...</li>
            <li>am so disappointed because this was the perfect solution for my</li>
            <li>My sister from California first introduced me to this product and not only does she travel with it, but she orders it by the case.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other similar product out there.</li>
            <li>This product is formulated similarly with many other analgesic formulations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other things like Icy Hot and a few others, none work as good.</li>
            <li>I sent a tea  that helped greatly with a cold</li>
            <li>Great for a cold or sinus head ache, you name it...</li>
            <li>Unkers is my go to salve when I want to soothe my muscles and to clear my sinuses.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants instant relief from stuffiness.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t completely eliminate my tension/pain</li>
            <li>BUT it will help with relieving some of the aches and pains associated with being alive.  </li>
            <li>she is 92 years old.</li>
            <li>When my mom was a young girl, they rubbed some on her chest when she had pneumonia ...  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 92 year old neighbor.</li>
            <li>My 94 year old Mom talked me into buying it</li>
            <li>I would refer my old customers to this seller or website.</li>
            <li>All natural</li>
            <li>I use it frequently for aftermath of muscle cramps and it resolves the soreness.</li>
            <li>After using it the first night, Mom told me that the salve was greasier than she expected it to be</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using it on my lower back which is sore more often than not from too much sitting and poor core strength.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than vicks, but my real little ones don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li>Works well, a little greasy though and not sure it works as great as I was hoping for dry skin.</li>
            <li>My 92 year old Dad has frequent and numerous itchy skin eruptions.  </li>
            <li>No other product has lived up to this product.  </li>
            <li>The jar was quite large and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped enough that I can exercise without too much discomfort which should, in the long run, resolve the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 5 years and recently introduced it to my 88 year old mother for her arthritic knees.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by several friends and my husband and I were pleasantly surprised by its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no different from Icy Hot or mentholated rubs.  </li>
            <li>When a neighbor told me how much it helped her; but was very hard to find I went right to Amazon &amp; found it.</li>
            <li>The smell is distinctive, but not unpleasant, lasts a long time too, a little goes a long way</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a good salve to have in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> AND IT DOE&#x27;S REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li> This is a superior for aches and joint pain.</li>

            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> smell wise.  </li>
            <li> I loved Unkers, but I will not be ordering anymore because of the petroleum base.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> does a good job on foot pain.</li>
            <li> This is good for sinuses as well as arthritic pain.  </li>
            <li> It feels good, yes, but pain relief does not occur.</li>
            <li> it does NOT have that overwhelming  odor which is great if you need to rub some on and go....</li>
            <li> And at this price, it better than a doctor&#x27;s visit that won&#x27;t help you any!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought this would be wonderful to rub on, instead of always reaching for Ibuprofen. First-</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I have used it for Sooo many things!  </li>

            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com...can offer it at a rather nice savings...</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like a cough drop or mentholatum (sp).  </li>
            <li> Excellent for fast relief of muscle and joint pain.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I liked rubbing the smelly salve on and around my head, but it did help quite a bit.</li>
            <li> very good for all  kinds of stiffness,  and sore throat, an  excellent rub when you are tired from  doing too much,  good for chest  colds.</li>
            <li> The odor of this product is not an offensive one, but kind of refreshing when inhaled.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this, as it had some good reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for so many uses like bug bites, light burns.</li>
            <li> Works great, and fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!!!  </li>

            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> It heals and takes away callouses, and headaches, pain in shoulders and more.</li>
            <li> perfect for any external ailment.</li>
            <li> but it made it much more bearable.  </li>
            <li> Added bonus, the vick&#x27;s smell covered up the funk of 4 people in a truck for 13 hours :)  </li>
            <li> This works better than any product my husband &amp; I have tried, even a written compound prescription from our doctor.</li>
            <li> Love Unker&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I use this product for so many issues, all of which are listed on the label.</li>
            <li> Way better than Vic&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> We use it for sore muscle and throats and much more.  </li>
            <li> This salve is not the magic bullet the manufactures would have you to believe.  </li>

            <li> Lets just say refreshing.  </li>

            <li> Just follow the directions and feel better soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a recommendation from my favorite writer.  </li>
            <li> i just love unkers, i use to sell the product</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li> Have already purchased more.</li>
            <li> Suggested to several people &amp; they were impressed with results!</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This stuff was recommended by a friend of mine and it works for everything and think its better than vicks or for any muscle aches.</li>
            <li> Love that it can be used for all it says.  </li>
            <li> It eases pain or eliminates it in most everything I&amp;#34;ve used it for.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Even if you want to sleep better at night.  </li>
            <li> I love it already.</li>
            <li> It is better than those products at the pharmacies.</li>
            <li> We are pleased with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> I am always pleased with the results I get from using Uncker&#x27;s and will continue to recommend it to anyone having certain kinds of pain as listed on the jar and more!!  </li>
            <li> gay unkers stays hot strong and smells good</li>
            <li> I use in on my feet to keep them smooth, better than any lotion I have used.  </li>
            <li> Want a good nights sleep, then you really need to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Unkers is such a good product!</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the original formula with camphor , eucalyptus and menthol</li>
            <li> product came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> better.unlike ben gay</li>
            <li> I was told that it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> also has a mild pleasing scent that doesn&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; to anyone within 25 feet!</li>
            <li> After yoga and some time at the gym, this felt great on my aching back and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I use it every night &amp; can sleep pain free.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I did not assume it would take away ALL pain, but help significantly - nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have passed it on to many friends who also think it&#x27;s wonderful, especially for sore joints, muscle, back &amp; neck pain.  </li>
            <li> I first discovered Unker&#x27;s at an Amish Store in Fredericksburg, TX and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> We tried this originally from a relative when visiting Ohio and found it very helpful for aches and pains, so when we ran out we ordered more and think it is great.</li>
            <li> Unker&#x27;s clears them and significantly reduces the associated itchiness.</li>
            <li> It also felt cool on, but did NOTHING - zero- for any pain relief.</li>
            <li> but when I&#x27;m home and really need relief, its what I can count on more than national  brands I got at a store.</li>
            <li> and she wasn&#x27;t sure that it really eased her foot pain.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> When compared to Sombra, the latter is superior in quality and function.</li>
            <li> and I use it as such with good results.</li>
            <li> it came in super quick with a super price</li>
            <li> This salve works better than the high priced ointments on the market.</li>
            <li> its my new favorite things in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have suggested it to several friends who love it!</li>
            <li> I was happy with the results, but I was expecting it to be a little stronger on the aches.</li>
            <li> Rub it on the soles of your feet to calm a cough and rub on your sinuses to ease congetsion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been an old family favorite for years.</li>
            <li> I ordered for a friend and decided to get one for myself since this 90 Year old friend said it works for most anything!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> so it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Actually felt nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best kept secret for purchase over the counter pharmacy items</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t find it quite so effective, so the five star rating is based on my wife&#x27;s opinion.</li>
            <li> I use it for colds, sinus problems, bruises, and many many other things.  </li>
            <li> Husband loves this product and this is a good buy comparing to other places you can buy it.  </li>
            <li> Right on time.</li>
            <li> I used it right away the moment I received it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will have more things down the road to try it on,</li>
            <li> The hives stopped itching and hurting right away, the cooling sensation was a blessing and the hives were gone very fast.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and effective for a strained back and works well on insect bites.</li>
            <li> i first heard of unkers 3yrs ago</li>
            <li> only is unkers better</li>
            <li> It works for so many different ailments!!!</li>
            <li> This is a must have in the first aid cabinet.</li>
            <li> The tine spand for using it has been very short for a more exact rating.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for sending it so promptly and its the real deal!</li>
            <li> We first found it in a Mennonite store in Ohio.</li>
            <li> My first choice for arthritic pain for years</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t purchase locally anympre, so we are glad I can get it here</li>
            <li> I order more everytime the jar gets low.</li>
            <li> A funny (kinda) story...</li>
            <li> Appreciated receiving the Unker&#x27;s Medicated Salve and have used it a number of times already!  </li>
            <li> This is better than current Vick&#x27;s vapor rub you can buy at the store!</li>
            <li> started out good, helping my sore skin from shingles pain, but after a few weeks started burning.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and the pain goes away within a few minutes after rubbing it on.</li>
            <li> It has been nice to have some relief from my daily headaches, but my new Unker&#x27;s perfume might take awhile to catch on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for many things and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that that the odor is rather strong.</li>
            <li> A large bottle lasts us a couple of years.</li>
            <li> but since i am not working i do not have the large clientele anymore.  </li>
            <li> this unkers product holds the heat in and stays the same for 8 or 9 hours,unlike ben gay on for bout an 1hr or so.not</li>
            <li> Product is very greasy and I&#x27;m finding that it does t work at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Item just as described Fast Ship</li>
            <li> Really like this product, have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Really like this medication.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This product really works...</li>
            <li> Stunk up the whole house</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> We will be ordering more as soon as this jar is getting empty.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> ever!i was using on mussles and seen where it was used for many other things.if you like ben gay or icy hot</li>
            <li> People in general, laugh at how I always say “You’ve got to try Unkers”.</li>
            <li> I have used UNKER&#x27;S for many years and it has never let me down.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you just have to stick with the older remedies.</li>
            <li> The main reason for the 4 stars and not 5 was that the texture of the ointment is like petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> Not only for all the things it says on the label, but when my chest is hurting or my glands in my neck hurt, I rub some Unker&#x27;s on over night, and the next day I am much better.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so when I read the reviews for this, I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> AWSOME for MULTIPLE things my whole family loves it!!</li>
            <li> He used a whole jar of Unkers because it helped ease the   pain considerably.</li>
            <li> that even a doctor prescribed steroid cream wasn&#x27;t helping that now thanks to Unkers is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Use only a little bit under the nose for congestion, it is very strong.</li>
            <li> Myself, family and friends love this product, but the jars are getting smaller and more expensive.</li>
            <li> first picked it up locally...</li>
            <li> am so disappointed because this was the perfect solution for my</li>
            <li> My sister from California first introduced me to this product and not only does she travel with it, but she orders it by the case.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other similar product out there.</li>
            <li> This product is formulated similarly with many other analgesic formulations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things like Icy Hot and a few others, none work as good.</li>
            <li> I sent a tea  that helped greatly with a cold</li>
            <li> Great for a cold or sinus head ache, you name it...</li>
            <li> Unkers is my go to salve when I want to soothe my muscles and to clear my sinuses.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants instant relief from stuffiness.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely eliminate my tension/pain</li>
            <li> BUT it will help with relieving some of the aches and pains associated with being alive.  </li>
            <li> she is 92 years old.</li>
            <li> When my mom was a young girl, they rubbed some on her chest when she had pneumonia ...  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 92 year old neighbor.</li>
            <li> My 94 year old Mom talked me into buying it</li>
            <li> I would refer my old customers to this seller or website.</li>
            <li> All natural</li>
            <li> I use it frequently for aftermath of muscle cramps and it resolves the soreness.</li>
            <li> After using it the first night, Mom told me that the salve was greasier than she expected it to be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it on my lower back which is sore more often than not from too much sitting and poor core strength.  </li>
            <li> Works much better than vicks, but my real little ones don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> Works well, a little greasy though and not sure it works as great as I was hoping for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My 92 year old Dad has frequent and numerous itchy skin eruptions.  </li>
            <li> No other product has lived up to this product.  </li>
            <li> The jar was quite large and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped enough that I can exercise without too much discomfort which should, in the long run, resolve the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years and recently introduced it to my 88 year old mother for her arthritic knees.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by several friends and my husband and I were pleasantly surprised by its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no different from Icy Hot or mentholated rubs.  </li>
            <li> When a neighbor told me how much it helped her; but was very hard to find I went right to Amazon &amp; found it.</li>
            <li> The smell is distinctive, but not unpleasant, lasts a long time too, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This is cold than hot ,it feels good on my poor hands.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from chronic back pain (and my wife has constant neck pain), we use Unker&#x27;s pretty regularly and it really helps with minor aches, pains, and tight muscles/knots.</li>
            <li> and I thought I would go insane with the incredible burning it caused.  </li>
            <li> It has so many uses and can&#x27;t be beat for winter colds and cold weather issues.</li>
            <li> I have just general aches in my shoulder and back from everyday life.</li>
            <li> I BEEN USING UNKER&#x27;S FOR A LONG TIME FOR PAIN</li>
            <li> this balm is  very strong, unlike other commercil balms, i use it for neck massage, during cold and sinuses and stuff, would recommend it</li>
            <li> When I use my hands for gardening, house cleaning, and other things in the same day, my old hands ache and fingers get stiff.</li>
            <li> , we have ordered extra are are giving to other family members and friends.  </li>
            <li> Also, my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My dry knees, blocked nasal passages, sore muscles and sore throats.  </li>
            <li> I had osteroarthritis  I can not live with out it..</li>
            <li> AND it takes such a small amount of salve that the jar will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> Instead I simply added that odd smell to my shoulders and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Put under center of feet at night for coughs.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same Unkers product I previously had!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a simple product that just plain works.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely helpful before and after a knee replacement.</li>
            <li> My Dad uses this for his knees due to pain from Lyme disease.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and uses it all the time for sore muscles and other aches and pains.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is a competitive soccer player, and uses this for her muscle aches-she swears by it and doesn&#x27;t like any other OTC salve we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> THEREIS OTHER USES TO..</li>
            <li> This product is a wonder for aching muscles or other parts of your body which needs rejuvinating.  </li>
            <li> My son uses it before every soccer game, my brother in law uses’ it to relieve a constant pain in his back and my wife’s  aunt uses it for leg pains she has had for years</li>
            <li> Worked when an expensive prescription didn&#x27;t to clear up a mysterious sore on my finger.</li>
            <li> My neck and shoulders tend to get very tight on long drives.  </li>
            <li> it is slightly oily and has a smell of Vicks Vapor rub (could&#x27;ve bought that for less).</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that had less odor.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hot and it wasn&#x27;t a cold feeling.  </li>
            <li> This product is used every few days.</li>
            <li> I used this product on our Christmas vacation trip (1700 mi round trip in a week) and it helped substantially.  </li>
            <li> I use this product every  day a few times...</li>
            <li> I do this for a few nights to take care of any problems.</li>
            <li> It does work for a few hours before having to reapply</li>
            <li> We have used Unker&#x27;s for 15 years for relaxing stiff or aching muscles and joints.</li>
            <li> I just plain works on any aches and pains.</li>
            <li> He cried for a little, till she realized what she had done and washed it off!</li>
            <li> This medicated salve is from the past and it is a miracle worker when it comes to breathing easier.  </li>
            <li> We have a small bottle which we refill and take when we travel.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have purchased the small jars by the case and given it out to friends and family members.</li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> This product would certainly rank higher if the product contained cayenne for providing heat in joints.</li>
            <li> My hands were getting very hard to use because of pain&lt;br /&gt;from arthritus, but after a few days of using it on the backs of my hands, the pain is almost gone.</li>
            <li> he LOVES it and its hard to find</li>
            <li> My father worked maintenance in a chemical plant for 30 years which was hard on his knees.</li>
            <li> I purchase the product for an elderly lady who suffers from back and knee pain.  </li>
            <li> This is a must-have product especially during cold season.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of this stuff until a friend on Face Book was having some bad back pain and one of her friends said to try this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from skin hives every spring and this time, tired of trying all kinds of creams and potions, came accross Unkers.</li>
            <li> The stuff smells worse than Vick and doesn&#x27;t work.i tried it on sore muscles ,on the bottom of my feet al night with socks.</li>
            <li> Rubbing Unkers on the ankle makes it easier to move and less painful.</li>
            <li> It has a weird feeling that I don&#x27;t know how to describe.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Was unable to use.</li>
            <li> I have a very painful ankle due to a break almost two years ago.  </li>
            <li> for knee pain and cold rrlief</li>
            <li> and I thought she was crazy</li>
            <li> but it stinks...</li>
            <li> This can be used for everything ... from an aching muscle to a head cold</li>
            <li> My husband swears by it on cold sores.</li>
            <li> Buy this item and you won&#x27;t be sorry...!</li>
            <li> issues but truth is, it is very expensive</li>
            <li> Soothing when sick with a cold.</li>
            <li> but it helped my bad tennis elbow</li>
            <li> My waist&#x27;s hurt so bad</li>
            <li> My daughter says it helps her headaches (rubs on forehead and base of neck)</li>
            <li> I would like to see the petroleum base removed.</li>
            <li> I use this on the bottom of my daughter&#x27;s feet when she has a very bad cough and cannot sleep at night.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was happy with the results, but I was expecting it to be a little stronger on the aches.</li>
            <li> I found this to be very good at easing arthritis aches and pains. also has a mild pleasing scent that doesn&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; to anyone within 25 feet!</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product and very good seller!</li>
            <li> very good for all  kinds of stiffness,  and sore throat, an  excellent rub when you are tired from  doing too much,  good for chest  colds.</li>
            <li> Works on pain and all kinds of problems.  And at this price, it better than a doctor&#x27;s visit that won&#x27;t help you any!</li>
            <li> There is only one way to describe this product, Awesome.  This medicated salve is from the past and it is a miracle worker when it comes to breathing easier.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants instant relief from stuffiness.  Great product, great seller. Want a good nights sleep, then you really need to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this product and this is a good buy comparing to other places you can buy it.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> i first heard of unkers 3yrs ago and im telling you its the best stuff ever!i was using on mussles and seen where it was used for many other things.if you like ben gay or icy hot you going to love this better.unlike ben gay this unkers product holds the heat in and stays the same for 8 or 9 hours,unlike ben gay on for bout an 1hr or so.not only is unkers better then been gay unkers stays hot strong and smells good i think.gotta try it ppl good stuff</li>
            <li> I have a very painful ankle due to a break almost two years ago.  Rubbing Unkers on the ankle makes it easier to move and less painful.</li>
            <li> I have used Unkers for over 5 years now. It is an amazing product that sooths your joints and muscle aches. We  use it as a chest rub for colds. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 6 months now and I can not be without it.  I use on my back and my thumbs.  I think it is the greatest&lt;br /&gt;product made.  Nothing else has helped as this has.  Strongly recommend it.  I have several people here at work and also friends that&lt;br /&gt;use it now from PA to FL to MT.  They all love it.</li>
            <li> Quite the odor of Vick&#x27;s Vap-o-rub, but with some added ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been an old family favorite for years. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Gift for hubby - he LOVES it and its hard to find</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It works for so many different ailments!!!</li>
            <li> I learned about this product years ago when a customer and I decided to exchange formula&#x27;s..I sent a tea  that helped greatly with a cold but when I received Unkers which is for sore joints , muscles, tendons , ..colds, etc.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how wonderful this product is...I&#x27;ve told everyone at my current job about it and they all have a jar and   swear by it...One co worker said that this was the only product that helped her when she had Chemo..that&#x27;s quite a claim.  My husband recently had knee replacement and was in alot of pain..He used a whole jar of Unkers because it helped ease the   pain considerably.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and effective for a strained back and works well on insect bites. This is a must have in the first aid cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have just general aches in my shoulder and back from everyday life. After reading the reviews I thought this would be wonderful to rub on, instead of always reaching for Ibuprofen. First- it is slightly oily and has a smell of Vicks Vapor rub (could&#x27;ve bought that for less). It also felt cool on, but did NOTHING - zero- for any pain relief. I did not assume it would take away ALL pain, but help significantly - nothing. Instead I simply added that odd smell to my shoulders and that&#x27;s it. Would not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> I was told that it worked fine.  The tine spand for using it has been very short for a more exact rating.  This product is used every few days.</li>
            <li> Product is very greasy and I&#x27;m finding that it does t work at all. I was really excited to get this, as it had some good reviews. It is not something I will be recommending.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have passed it on to many friends who also think it&#x27;s wonderful, especially for sore joints, muscle, back &amp; neck pain.  I use it daily for my Fibromyalgia. It was extremely helpful before and after a knee replacement. It&#x27;s one product that should be in everyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> seems to work after a couple of applications</li>
            <li> There is nothing like this, it works for any and all skin ailments.</li>
            <li> I had osteroarthritis  I can not live with out it.. thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. It heals and takes away callouses, and headaches, pain in shoulders and more. I just wish it didn&#x27;t smell like menthol.</li>
            <li> My husband said it work for his back.&lt;br /&gt;So we will buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for aches and pains.  I get relief after 5 minutes of applying.  The only downside is that that the odor is rather strong.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that had less odor.  It helped with some aches and pains but not all.</li>
            <li> have used the product before.  husband loves it and uses it almost nightly for his sinus&#x27;.  perfect for any external ailment.</li>
            <li> My neck and shoulders tend to get very tight on long drives.  I used this product on our Christmas vacation trip (1700 mi round trip in a week) and it helped substantially.  It didn&#x27;t completely eliminate my tension/pain but it made it much more bearable.  Added bonus, the vick&#x27;s smell covered up the funk of 4 people in a truck for 13 hours :)  I&#x27;m also using it on my lower back which is sore more often than not from too much sitting and poor core strength.  It&#x27;s helped enough that I can exercise without too much discomfort which should, in the long run, resolve the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of this as a chemical massage.  If your issue is something massage helps then this product probably will as well.</li>
            <li> Item just as described Fast Ship Five Stars*****</li>
            <li> We knew there would be an odor, but I could smell it on my husband while I was outside and he was in the house!!  Also, it does not wash out of clothes it touches.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Really like this product, have used it for years. Thank you for sending it so promptly and its the real deal!</li>
            <li> Really like this medication.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I use it for everything and share it with&lt;br /&gt;friends.  Every home should have it!</li>
            <li> I came across this product through a friend of my grandmother 20 years ago. I would not be without it.&lt;br /&gt;It works on every ache &amp; pain, bite, burn or sting. Great for a cold or sinus head ache, you name it... Love it!</li>
            <li> started out good, helping my sore skin from shingles pain, but after a few weeks started burning.  Stopped for a week then tried it again and I thought I would go insane with the incredible burning it caused.  My friend loved it and had no problem</li>
            <li> This is a awesome product!!! When a neighbor told me how much it helped her; but was very hard to find I went right to Amazon &amp; found it. Arrived in 2 days!! This works better than any product my husband &amp; I have tried, even a written compound prescription from our doctor.</li>
            <li> Love Unker&#x27;s. Soothing when sick with a cold.</li>
            <li> Myself, family and friends love this product, but the jars are getting smaller and more expensive.</li>
            <li> I use this product for so many issues, all of which are listed on the label. It works for everything listed.</li>
            <li> I have  used this salve for years and it never  disappoints.  Always soothes and heals any problems I might have.</li>
            <li> My son requests this after football practice.</li>
            <li> this balm is  very strong, unlike other commercil balms, i use it for neck massage, during cold and sinuses and stuff, would recommend it</li>
            <li> Only used it 2 tmes. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Unkers is such a good product! Way better than Vic&#x27;s. We use it for sore muscle and throats and much more.  I would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. It&#x27;s been great for sore muscles. I use this all the time and it gives me relief from back pain.</li>
            <li> My father worked maintenance in a chemical plant for 30 years which was hard on his knees. He uses Unkers to eliminate pain and stiffness.</li>
            <li> This salve is not the magic bullet the manufactures would have you to believe.  It will NOT cure anything BUT it will help with relieving some of the aches and pains associated with being alive.  I guess it is good to have around for &amp;#34;minor&amp;#34; issues but truth is, it is very expensive and I wouldn&#x27;t buy again for what it actually does.</li>
            <li> I suffer from skin hives every spring and this time, tired of trying all kinds of creams and potions, came accross Unkers. The hives stopped itching and hurting right away, the cooling sensation was a blessing and the hives were gone very fast. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years.It&#x27;s good for many things and a little goes a long way.Sometimes you just have to stick with the older remedies.I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After yoga and some time at the gym, this felt great on my aching back and shoulders.  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> It works better than. 178 dollarm bottle of perscription medicated lotion from my doctor.  It smells like menthal but that smell disapates in about 15 minutes.  The main reason for the 4 stars and not 5 was that the texture of the ointment is like petroleum jelly and I have to put my hair up so it doesn&#x27;t get in it when I put it on my neck and I don&#x27;t want to get it on clothes, but when I&#x27;m home and really need relief, its what I can count on more than national  brands I got at a store.</li>
            <li> I use this product every  day a few times...I have suggested it to several friends who love it! It is better than anything over counter and many prescriptions. I will not go a day without it.</li>
            <li> We have used Unker&#x27;s for 15 years for relaxing stiff or aching muscles and joints. We first found it in a Mennonite store in Ohio. A large bottle lasts us a couple of years. We have a small bottle which we refill and take when we travel.</li>
            <li> This is a good salve to have in the medicine cabinet.  The scent is not overbearing.  You will like this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome have used for years</li>
            <li> I BEEN USING UNKER&#x27;S FOR A LONG TIME FOR PAIN AND IT DOE&#x27;S REALLY GOOD I ALWAY ORDER IT 2 OR 3 TIMES A YEAR</li>
            <li> The stuff smells worse than Vick and doesn&#x27;t work.i tried it on sore muscles ,on the bottom of my feet al night with socks.</li>
            <li> stuff is great...makes my hip  feel  tons better</li>
            <li> This is a superior for aches and joint pain. No other product has lived up to this product.  I have always had relief and been able to sleep. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I ordered for a friend and decided to get one for myself since this 90 Year old friend said it works for most anything!&lt;br /&gt;Well it came in super quick with a super price and I have used it for Sooo many things!  It works on joint pain, hemaroids congestion and aches!  I&#x27;m sure I will have more things down the road to try it on, for now that&#x27;s all!  AND it takes such a small amount of salve that the jar will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> Actually does what it says  My first choice for arthritic pain for years</li>
            <li> I purchase the product for an elderly lady who suffers from back and knee pain.  She thoroughly enjoyed it. she is 92 years old.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It is especially good for arthritis pain in the hands and also for foot pain.&lt;br /&gt;The product came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;planning to order 2 more for friends&lt;br /&gt;used for knee pain and cold rrlief&lt;br /&gt;first tried years ago</li>
            <li> My dad turned me on to Unkers.  He thought the company had been purchased by another company.  I was so happy to find genuine Unkers here on Amazon.  I bought one for me and one for him!  I use in on my feet to keep them smooth, better than any lotion I have used.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on anything. bring it on. Hemorrhoids. Nail fungus. Sore muscles. Amazing.</li>
            <li> Nothing like this stuff.  Make sure you get the original formula with camphor , eucalyptus and menthol</li>
            <li> My cousin recommended that my mom use Unker&#x27;s on her feet.  I ordered it for her.  After using it the first night, Mom told me that the salve was greasier than she expected it to be and she wasn&#x27;t sure that it really eased her foot pain.  She is still using Unker&#x27;s, but I don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;ll reorder it.</li>
            <li> Great for aches and pains! Love it.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I rub it on my itch, hurts and sore spots. Also, my dry skin. I am on my third container. It doesn&#x27;t stain. It is&lt;br /&gt;somewhat greasy, but after a short time it absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This product really works... Not only for all the things it says on the label, but when my chest is hurting or my glands in my neck hurt, I rub some Unker&#x27;s on over night, and the next day I am much better. I do this for a few nights to take care of any problems. When my mom was a young girl, they rubbed some on her chest when she had pneumonia ...  It worked.</li>
            <li> This stuff will take the sting and pain out of any cut, burn, abrasion. I never want to run out of it.</li>
            <li> Exceeds Expectations!</li>
            <li> Product was as ordered</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 92 year old neighbor. She loves it and sas been using for several years. She can&#x27;t purchase locally anympre, so we are glad I can get it here</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.  He found if several years ago and has been using it for arthritis pain and lower back pain.  I order more everytime the jar gets low.</li>
            <li> This products beats everything else used for aches, pains and sprains. I have been using this product for over 5 years and recently introduced it to my 88 year old mother for her arthritic knees.  She is also a convert now.... it does NOT have that overwhelming  odor which is great if you need to rub some on and go....it&#x27;s relief in a jar.  A definite winner !</li>
            <li> I use it for massages for two years now, I love working with it. Great product, great service. Shipping is always on time.</li>
            <li> Using this on my psoriasis.  Just started yesterday but seems to be helping with the inflammation and itching</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome...first picked it up locally...Amazon.com...can offer it at a rather nice savings...&amp;...right to your doorsteps...</li>
            <li> This does help with sore muscles, but not as well as I hoped. I need to reapply often, but I have severe joint and muscle issues so I may not be a good source as a reviewer here. My daughter says it helps her headaches (rubs on forehead and base of neck) but I haven&#x27;t tried this yet. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet and it works great and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> Unkers is the best! Sometimes it&#x27;s the only relief I get from headache/sinus pain! Such a wonderful, therapeutic product!</li>
            <li> Unkers is my go to salve when I want to soothe my muscles and to clear my sinuses.  Rubbing this salve on to sore muscles develops a level of heat that is soothing and loosens up sore joints.  It is not a panacea for joint pain or sore muscles but it does help.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It works on just about every problem you might have...muscle/joint pain headaches colds or sinuses burns rashes insect bites etc...and yes even hemorrhoids!! It says it works for cuts but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  My sister told me about this and I thought she was crazy but I burned my hand with boiling water and she sprayed it with the Unkers natl-rub spray and immediately the pain &amp;I burning stopped. I was hooked!!! I bought the spray and the salve and I love them both. I&#x27;ve uZsed them for muscle pain headache sinus congestion and on a itchy rash on myjust arm that even a doctor prescribed steroid cream wasn&#x27;t helping that now thanks to Unkers is completely gone. And yes my dad used it on his hemorrhoids and it helped a lot.  It truly is a great product that is a must have around any home. Try it today and I recommend purchasing it from Dutyfreebeauty on Amazon...it was cheaper than others and shipped immediately!!!!!</li>
            <li> Another winner. This salve works better than the high priced ointments on the market. It smells good and the pain goes away within a few minutes after rubbing it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Unkers for the last 10 years...It&#x27;s great. I just plain works on any aches and pains. It promotes healing of wounds and works great on sunburn. I’ve recommended it to relatives, friend and anyone that’s talking about a pain. My son uses it before every soccer game, my brother in law uses’ it to relieve a constant pain in his back and my wife’s  aunt uses it for leg pains she has had for years (she’s 86). People in general, laugh at how I always say “You’ve got to try Unkers”.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t do with out unker&#x27;s.  there are times when nothing else works, try unker&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I use this on my knee often.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!!!  Thank You.  Good stuff but it stinks...smell wise.  Kind of smells like a cough drop or mentholatum (sp).  Stunk up the whole house but it helped my bad tennis elbow so it was worth it.  It has a weird feeling that I don&#x27;t know how to describe.  Lets just say refreshing.  It wasn&#x27;t hot and it wasn&#x27;t a cold feeling.  Actually felt nice.  I&#x27;d never heard of this stuff until a friend on Face Book was having some bad back pain and one of her friends said to try this stuff.  So I looked it up and here I am.  I might try the spray on stuff next time, should I need it.</li>
            <li> I use this product all year. It has so many uses and can&#x27;t be beat for winter colds and cold weather issues. I have used UNKER&#x27;S for many years and it has never let me down. In the past, I have purchased the small jars by the case and given it out to friends and family members.</li>
            <li> I use Unker&#x27;s salve for so many things!  My dry knees, blocked nasal passages, sore muscles and sore throats.  My 94 year old Mom talked me into buying it and now I&#x27;m telling my kids to get it.  It is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> We like this product. Great for muscle aches and all sorts of pain. The jar was quite large and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works much better than vicks, but my real little ones don&#x27;t like it! A funny (kinda) story...my mom was babysitting, and my baby was &amp;#34;sore&amp;#34; so she grabbed the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; which ended up being Unker&#x27;s! He cried for a little, till she realized what she had done and washed it off!</li>
            <li> Works great, awesome product!</li>
            <li> This can be used for everything ... from an aching muscle to a head cold&lt;br /&gt;This is the best kept secret for purchase over the counter pharmacy items</li>
            <li> I like Unker&#x27;s Medicated Salve. It helps with arthritis pain, colds, etc. I would recommend everyone to have some on hand!</li>
            <li> I loved Unkers, but I will not be ordering anymore because of the petroleum base.&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed because this was the perfect solution for my&lt;br /&gt;many aches.  I would like to see the petroleum base removed.</li>
            <li> My Dad uses this for his knees due to pain from Lyme disease.  He has used a lot of different kinds of products and likes the Bunker&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hip and use this to help relieve the pain. It does work for a few hours before having to reapply</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a simple product that just plain works.  Don&#x27;t ask me why smearing this on your feet helps your head, I can&#x27;t explain it.  Just follow the directions and feel better soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a recommendation from my favorite writer.  This is cold than hot ,it feels good on my poor hands.</li>
            <li> I Use this from my car accident and it works great.</li>
            <li> I first discovered Unker&#x27;s at an Amish Store in Fredericksburg, TX and fell in love with it. As someone who suffers from chronic back pain (and my wife has constant neck pain), we use Unker&#x27;s pretty regularly and it really helps with minor aches, pains, and tight muscles/knots.</li>
            <li> We use this stuff for everything. My husband swears by it on cold sores.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat user of Unker&#x27;s and have referred it to several of my family and friends.  I am always pleased with the results I get from using Uncker&#x27;s and will continue to recommend it to anyone having certain kinds of pain as listed on the jar and more!!  My sister from California first introduced me to this product and not only does she travel with it, but she orders it by the case.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for body pain massage</li>
            <li> We tried this originally from a relative when visiting Ohio and found it very helpful for aches and pains, so when we ran out we ordered more and think it is great.</li>
            <li> I use it every night &amp; can sleep pain free. I recommend Unker&#x27;s for any ne who has knee or shoulder pains.</li>
            <li> i just love unkers, i use to sell the product but since i am not working i do not have the large clientele anymore.  I would refer my old customers to this seller or website.</li>
            <li> Unker&#x27;s salve is the BEST medicine ever made including all of my RXs.  I use it for colds, sinus problems, bruises, and many many other things.  Rub on the bottoms of your feet and stop coughing.  Buy this item and you won&#x27;t be sorry...!</li>
            <li> It was recommended by several friends and my husband and I were pleasantly surprised by its effectiveness.  We&#x27;ve already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and uses it all the time for sore muscles and other aches and pains.  I personally don&#x27;t find it quite so effective, so the five star rating is based on my wife&#x27;s opinion.</li>
            <li> It has allowed me to forget my knee pain at interval of time and continue to work!</li>
            <li> does a good job on foot pain.</li>
            <li> This is good for sinuses as well as arthritic pain.  My husband and I both like the results when used.</li>
            <li> Had a smaller container of Unkers than ran out.  So happy to have found it here.  My daughter is a competitive soccer player, and uses this for her muscle aches-she swears by it and doesn&#x27;t like any other OTC salve we&#x27;ve tried.  The smell is distinctive, but not unpleasant, lasts a long time too, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Will order more as needed!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Does everything that it claims. Have already purchased more.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Excellent for fast relief of muscle and joint pain.  Have recommended it to others already.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other similar product out there. My wife is constantly struggling with lower back pain and this helps out a lot. I get knee pain from time to time and once I put this on it&#x27;s helps! I&#x27;ve tried other things like Icy Hot and a few others, none work as good.</li>
            <li> This is the best for EVERYTHING. All natural</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!  Suggested to several people &amp; they were impressed with results!</li>
            <li> My waist&#x27;s hurt so bad ,when the fan air hit them , I have to cover them , but now I don&#x27;t  I love it</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same Unkers product I previously had!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. I USE IT FOR ACHES AND PAINS. THEREIS OTHER USES TO..</li>
            <li> This works so well, we have ordered extra are are giving to other family members and friends.  Works for just about everything that ails your skin!</li>
            <li> Product is as described.  Works on multple ailments.  Has already helped with migraine headache.  Great product.  The odor of this product is not an offensive one, but kind of refreshing when inhaled.</li>
            <li> This product is formulated similarly with many other analgesic formulations. This product would certainly rank higher if the product contained cayenne for providing heat in joints. When compared to Sombra, the latter is superior in quality and function. And excellent pricing for Sombra exists at [...]</li>
            <li> I have migraines and neck arthritis so when I read the reviews for this, I had high hopes.  It&#x27;s no different from Icy Hot or mentholated rubs.  It feels good, yes, but pain relief does not occur.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have product especially during cold season. Rub it on the soles of your feet to calm a cough and rub on your sinuses to ease congetsion.</li>
            <li> We use this for colds--rub on chest and bottom of feet to decongest and quiet coughs. For headaches put it on your forehead for rapid relief.</li>
            <li> After filling numerous prescriptions for headaches, my pharmacist pulled me aside and told me about Unker&#x27;s. They didn&#x27;t sell it at this big chain store/pharmacy where we were, but he told me that he had people tell him that it helped their headaches. I decided to try it. I can&#x27;t say I liked rubbing the smelly salve on and around my head, but it did help quite a bit. (It smells like Vapor Rub.) It has been nice to have some relief from my daily headaches, but my new Unker&#x27;s perfume might take awhile to catch on. My husband, children, and I have used it for muscle aches, growing pains, arthritis, and of course the headaches. It works well for all of it.</li>
            <li> I use this specifically on my feet/heels.  But I also put it on any type of skin abrasion.  It definitely helps soothe and heal.  I like to always keep it on hand and I bought some for my Mom and Dad.  Dad likes it also.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my wife&#x27;s hand and feet. it works great stuffed nose, colds, and a great item for what ailes you.</li>
            <li> Works great, and fast shipping!  My husband has arthritis, and he loves this product.  We will be ordering more as soon as this jar is getting empty.</li>
            <li> I use this for what ever ails me.  Had to return it because the jar was completely open in the box and the contents had splled out.</li>
            <li> Heals and soothes and great for coughs</li>
            <li> Worked when an expensive prescription didn&#x27;t to clear up a mysterious sore on my finger.</li>
            <li> This stuff was recommended by a friend of mine and it works for everything and think its better than vicks or for any muscle aches. I love it and would recommend this for everyone!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable! Virtually instant relief for leg and hand cramps</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Suggested by a friend whose mom used it for everything when she was a child.  i have used for stuffy noses, burns, aches, eczema, coughs, congestion ... its my new favorite things in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have used Unkers medicated salve for several years. When I use my hands for gardening, house cleaning, and other things in the same day, my old hands ache and fingers get stiff. I rub this salve into the back of my hands and apply it to the fingers for some relief. I also use it on my knees, ankles, and feet. I&#x27;ve been known to apply it to the forehead and bridge of the nose and across the cheekbones to relieve sinus congestion. I consider this a multi purpose medicated salve and I use it as such with good results. I recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> My cousin told me about this product.  Love that it can be used for all it says.  Happy with the purchased.</li>
            <li> Sorry but it had melted over everything. Was unable to use. I will try again  in the fall. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works for some conditions, but not &amp;#34;a cure all.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works well, a little greasy though and not sure it works as great as I was hoping for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Unkers for years....bites, stings, bruises, colds, coughs, burns....it is a wonderful product!!  You should purchase it one time and see for yourself...you would then be a believer!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievable. It eases pain or eliminates it in most everything I&amp;#34;ve used it for. My hands were getting very hard to use because of pain&lt;br /&gt;from arthritus, but after a few days of using it on the backs of my hands, the pain is almost gone. I am telling everyone I know about how well it works, and plan on giving it as a present at Christmas and birthdays. I hope they never stop making this wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the best for any ache or pain</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing !</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using Unker&#x27;s for years.  I swear by it for everything.  Even if you want to sleep better at night.  Put it on your feet and throw a pair of socks on.  Works every time.</li>
            <li> Right on time. I love it already. I used it right away the moment I received it. It is better than those products at the pharmacies.</li>
            <li> This product is a wonder for aching muscles or other parts of your body which needs rejuvinating.  I use it frequently for aftermath of muscle cramps and it resolves the soreness.</li>
            <li> Appreciated receiving the Unker&#x27;s Medicated Salve and have used it a number of times already!  Great item to keep in your medicine cabinet or when traveling!</li>
            <li> AWSOME for MULTIPLE things my whole family loves it!!</li>
            <li> We are pleased with the results of this product.My husband has nueropathy in his feet and knees.This product does not take away all the pain,BUT it does help to reduce it.</li>
            <li> I use this on the bottom of my daughter&#x27;s feet when she has a very bad cough and cannot sleep at night. I don&#x27;t know why it works, but it does. It works great for aches and pains.</li>
            <li> This is better than current Vick&#x27;s vapor rub you can buy at the store! It&#x27;s good for so many uses like bug bites, light burns. Put under center of feet at night for coughs.Use only a little bit under the nose for congestion, it is very strong.</li>
            <li> My 92 year old Dad has frequent and numerous itchy skin eruptions.  Unker&#x27;s clears them and significantly reduces the associated itchiness.</li>
