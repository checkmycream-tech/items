            <li>and I hoping for even more.</li>

            <li>You&#x27;ll get better results, after all is your face.</li>
            <li>I had hoped I would see more results than I have in this time frame.  </li>
            <li>Others have been more resistant but seem lighter.  </li>
            <li>Not too sure yet but still trying</li>
            <li>but i need to get more it cleard my face</li>
            <li>Some spots have disappeared, others are more stubborn.  </li>
            <li>The customer service was outstanding, delivery was ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a many of products and none can beat this.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and smell.  </li>
            <li>, I will try one more bottle.</li>
            <li>Okay I have been using for about a month.</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t think I will order any more.</li>
            <li>bought two bottles and have used most of it.</li>
            <li>I have ordered another bottle and hope to see even better results with more time.  </li>
            <li>It has done a better job than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>,I got this one,I love that it came on time.looking forward to the result.  </li>
            <li>In any case I will purchase more because by skin likes it.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and is very lite.</li>
            <li>This product has been really great so far!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was worried that I might have a reaction to the corrector, but I experienced no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It really is that good.</li>
            <li>I will try and update this after I have been able to try it for a longer period, but was too excited not to share my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin looks healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>I plan to continue using it since I am seeing good, steady results.</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance, felt good on the skin, but did nothing to lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li>Ad in Amazon says the Best Dark Spot Corrector.  </li>
            <li>BEST DARK SPOT CORRECTOR!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing is all i can say ~&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have tried many products promising to fade darks spots for review and for the most part i have been pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, at first I was a skeptic.  </li>
            <li>The product is advertised as: \\&quot;The Best Dark Spot Corrector.  </li>
            <li>When they named this product\\&quot; The Best Dark Spot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great for most people, judging by the other reviews, but as stated in the product description, there are some that it is ineffective on.</li>
            <li>and I was super excited to get a complimentary bottle of this The One and share my honest and unbiased opinion with it here with you.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it came in a pump dispenser rather than a dropper, but I had a pump dispenser that I made fit the bottle</li>
            <li>so I am happy enough.  </li>
            <li>I have melasma, so I have light discoloration splotches all over my face.</li>
            <li>And I cannot say this serum had done anything but lightly hydrate my skin.  </li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smoothly and dries virtually immediately.  </li>
            <li>So far not so good.  </li>
            <li>I bought it based on the good reviews and the fact that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>Looks good so far.</li>
            <li>This product is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I made a video of the day I started using it as I was excited to get started and wanted to see the results and also keep a vlog.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your face first for maximum absorbency.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product home and getting results.  </li>
            <li>I have seen significant results from this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>This product has significantly lightened some discoloration that I had on my face.  </li>
            <li>The One has lightened it up more than 3/4 with the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I like the way this product feels silky smooth as it goes on and it absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it applied thinly to my clean face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed that there were so many positive reviews from others that claim they saw immediate results</li>
            <li>&quot; they were right on!</li>
            <li>There is no bad odor at all and the formula seems to be nice and soft.</li>
            <li>But the future looks bright (pun intended)</li>
            <li>I still have to have patients for me to truly see the full effect of the product.</li>
            <li>The marks are much lighter and have lost most of their color.  </li>
            <li>After using the solution and letting it soak in, then put on some good facial cream to keep area moist.</li>
            <li>most of it really does work if you use it like it says to use.</li>
            <li>However, the company contacted me immediately and provided a full refund.</li>
            <li>I have a body that is full of freckles.</li>
            <li>Make it sound too good to be true and charge an enormous amount for it and that should make it work right?</li>
            <li>Worked pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>I have a mild case of rosacea and it just made my face break out.  </li>
            <li>Seller shipped QUICKLY and was A+ ALL THE WAY!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I have notice a huge change after the first bottle</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Also, it would be good to let us know how long after&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am definitely getting more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and have noticed that my skin is smoother, more supple and most importantly the dark spots on the side of my face have started to fade.</li>
            <li>used the whole bottle it did not work!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy it because I do not see any real changes!!</li>
            <li>Yes so far I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love that the product is so natural and that I don&#x27;t have to worry about any harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I am a young 62 years old and fair skinned.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results so far</li>
            <li>I love that it has all natural ingredients, so you dont have to worry about chemicals going on your skin.</li>
            <li>I honestly did not see a difference after three weeks of religiously applying this product twice a day!</li>
            <li>I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li>Okay, I received this early January 2015 and have used it faithfully since I received it.</li>
            <li>Morning and night application to fresh skin, sunscreen and visors during the day.  </li>
            <li>the item was worth using.</li>
            <li>I feel as though I was tricked into buying this product by other purchasers who were encouraged to give feedback before they had time to give the product a fair trial.  </li>
            <li>I tried a bottle of this product and noticed some results right away.  </li>
            <li>With that many years working in the sun with no sun screen I ended up with major sun spots.</li>
            <li>I feel that The One makes it an easy choice with the perks of making this product with 98% of some of the highest quality natural ingredients, is made in an FDA regulated facility, has no parabens or sulfates and comes with a 100% product satisfaction guarantee!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much and bottle wasn&#x27;t full when purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report, that the one spot I tested it on for the past week is showing a change in color.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a go due to all the good reviews it has, and I must say that it really does work!  </li>
            <li>So far so good, red spots on arms started even out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a good sense how long it should normally take for a spot removal product to work</li>
            <li>so I am sure that this will last a nice long time.  </li>
            <li>and this is a very gentle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to try this product again, maybe takes time to see this product to work.</li>
            <li>It took about two weeks before I noticed the spots were fading, but I was also not using the product as consistently during this time.</li>
            <li>Just about done with my first  bottle.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the first 2 ingredients are water and witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Witch hazel has many benefits for skin such as fighting acne, locking in moisture, treating bruises and even helping to heal eczema and psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can definitely tell that my skin is in much better condition than before I started using this serum.</li>
            <li>I also recommend it to you, it really works!</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>After all, it has taken several years for these spots to become a permanent fixture on my skin so perhaps it will take a bit more time to erase them.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps in 6 weeks I can change this to a higher rating.</li>
            <li>fast!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27; used it for long but am starting to see some fading so that is great.</li>
            <li>following the  directions carefully, I really hoped it would make a difference!!!!, but there was no change for me.</li>
            <li>It is really a relief to know that some skin damage can be reversed with the right product.  </li>
            <li>product is exactly as described, visible improvement, fast results, would and will most likely buy again</li>
            <li>If I start seeing positive results, I&#x27;ll edit my review</li>
            <li>I could spend $5,000 on a procedure at my plastic surgeons to only maybe make my melasma better or a reasonable amount with this product and get real results.</li>
            <li>First corrector that removed old acne scars!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product less than a week and am already seeming amazing results.</li>
            <li>I have a large sun spot on my forearm, and I started using caster oil on this mark...</li>
            <li>I even went above and beyond by using band-aids to make sure none of the solution came off in bed or during the day for the new application.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t bother my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much result</li>
            <li>no one really is looking/noticing except me.</li>
            <li>Although the spot is still there, it is much easier to cover with concealer than it was before.  </li>
            <li>but it really does work for &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;...which can be classified as age spots, right?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking for faster results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, you really have nothing to lose trying this product.</li>
            <li>Great company that stands behind its products.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product.</li>
            <li>She convinced me that she is a real person and the cream worked for her.  </li>
            <li>the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it REALLY WORKED.  </li>
            <li>However, the company was very responsive</li>
            <li>but the signs are very encouraging.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been \\&quot;Best\\&quot; for me, as I can readily observe the product working since I began using it approximately&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Of course everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so results will be different, but if you are looking for an effective brown spot treatment, give this a try.</li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion, aside from a few freckles on my face due to sun damage over the years.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of the product before the marks went away completely, but I definitely saw significant improvement!  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to recieve this product for free in the exchange of my personal unbias review.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product religiously on three spots on my forehead twice a day for 2 full months.  </li>
            <li>but nothing changed, maybe it still need more time to work on my dark spot, will keep using anyway.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of full disclosure I&#x27;ve been sent an email with a discount coupon by the seller which I expect to use;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW from a compete stranger, I wouldn&#x27;t use the coupon or purchase the item a second time&lt;br /&gt;unless</li>
            <li>it will be more money down the drain&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>It just helps you to feel more comfortable ordering knowing that a company stands behind their product.  </li>
            <li>the dropper also is not very good.a clear bottle and a ceam would be better</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products &amp; this is the ONLY one that actually worked.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have not Seen any great imorovement,maybe dark spots a little lighter but not what I was hoping for, I use this product morning and evening .</li>
            <li>Good value, a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li>I got this product to review and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>but I do want them to be gentle to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am very into natural products, so</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your precious money on this one.</li>
            <li>I intend to continue using them for a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li>The corrector lotion is very lightweight, dries rather quickly, and my favorite perk is it is in a dark blue bottle, which means it will last longer.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money &amp; lasts a very long time, you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>This product is working much faster and is lightening the dark spots significantly.</li>
            <li>I get easily bitten by no seeums and mosquitoes and it leaves a dark spot on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>A little slower going that expected but a good product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t live up to the claim for me.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try and have been very surprised with my results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shopped at Amazon for years, but this is the first time that Amazon AND a rep from the manufacturer have emailed me shortly after the product arrived to request a rating.  </li>
            <li>Oh my wow!  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>Finally a product that really does work!</li>
            <li>It is looking more like the other (lighter) freckles around the same spot.</li>
            <li>I finally get it delivered,I didnt get the first order that I placed,Yaye</li>
            <li>it does not work on my dark spots even after more than a month constantly used it.</li>
            <li>I use it two times daily and the spot&#x27;s became more dark</li>
            <li>The dark spots on my face have lightened significantly.</li>
            <li>I have ordered another bottle for my wife to try.&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware of the fact that when you first put the solution on that you may experience a slight itching or burning sensation for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I am going to use this product until it&#x27;s done but as far as dec.</li>
            <li>and I know not everything works for everyone but as far as I can see it&#x27;s not made a difference for me.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;nt just give up on this natural ingredient product.</li>
            <li>People always think my eye makeup is smeared and try to wipe it off because it is near the corner of my eye.  </li>
            <li>I hope that with continued use the spot will go away completely.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that the color is milky.</li>
            <li>But in the area I use this product , my skin has never been as soft as it is now that I am using The One.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use that they&#x27;ll be gone completely, yet</li>
            <li>This is a complete rip off so far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s seems like it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Has it completely removed All my brown spots?  </li>
            <li>It is made from natural ingredients and does not contain hydroquinone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the spots completely fade away with repeated use.  </li>
            <li>I started out using it daily, but thought that it may have been too much and began using it three times a week during my nightly skin routine.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you that I have had no harsh side effects from this product</li>
            <li>The spots have lightened so much in just a short time!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is worth a shot, especially since the ingredients aren&#x27;t harmful.  </li>
            <li>So many products claim that it will take away the dark spots but they barely fade, this one on the other hand, really does work!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise the dark areas return just as quickly.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results - and a little bit goes a LONG way</li>
            <li>I am very faired skinned and worshipped the Sun for far too long in my youth.  </li>
            <li>I have some dark spots and freckles and over the 30 day application I expected to see a better result.  </li>
            <li>It works, not super quickly, but with time you can see the improvement.</li>
            <li>I use to be so self conscious of some scars I had on my legs, but at this point I can barely see them .  </li>
            <li>With so many products out there claiming to do all the same things its hard to pick which one to use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if I was having dark circles because of lack of sleep, I do have restless legs and that keeps me up a lot, but even after trying a sleep aid and getting more sleep, i still had dark circles.</li>
            <li>The size of this bottle is quite big, meaning this product will last you quite a while because you don&#x27;t use much of it.</li>
            <li>I hope I don&#x27;t get a whole lot more age spots because it could get expensive -</li>
            <li>This isnt a miracle over night cure, but over the course of 12 days the circles under my eyes have reduced 75% which is a MAJOR improvement</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t notice major change and I been using it for about 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li>I have finished the first bottom and going to buy the other bottom</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products with just a little result.</li>
            <li>They were barely noticeable!</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s just as dark after using more than half of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shocked about all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried this, it appeared that my dark spots were getting lighter but upon closer inspection</li>
            <li>I noticed results from this product clearing my dark spots in the first week.</li>
            <li>This product went on oily and clogged my pores near my eyes, creating multiple Stye</li>
            <li>Spent too much time in the sun.</li>
            <li>I am giving this product only 3 stars because, so far, it has not done what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>(Even on those spots it&#x27;s barely noticeable. )</li>
            <li>Cannot comment on dark spot correction feature yet, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference!</li>
            <li>I am going to order more and begin using it on my hands and arms which have begun to get a few dark spots as well.  </li>
            <li>What does seems to be happening with my skin is a noticeable \\&quot;lightening or toning\\&quot; of my entire face, which in itself is not bad, but is not what I wanted, i.e. to reduce the degree of darkness in just a few spots.  </li>
            <li>The other two products that I ordered from this site&#x27;s are:  Vernal HYALURONIC ACID PURE and Belitae Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I gave this product a two star review which may be a little harsh.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a few days so that&#x27;s why I am only giving it 4 stars as I don&#x27;t know what the full results will be.</li>
            <li>Although I love my freckled body, there are some spots that are very dark, and or uneven looking.</li>
            <li>Really works, removes all dark spots.</li>
            <li>I have tried a dark spot corrector from a salon and it didn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li>and I believe with long term use, it will help clear up the spots&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>That was until after the first few days had passed - there was a visible difference in the appearance of the circles that used to claim their space.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it has brightened up my entire face and after only a few days of use has begun to reduce those freckles or dark spots around my nose!  </li>
            <li>I however do have high hopes from his product based on other reviews.</li>
            <li>In that short period of time I can say that I can not see much of a difference in the dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li>Only one scar was really dark and that one is much lighter.  </li>
            <li>I can see a slight improvement in the \\&quot;tone\\&quot; of my face but after three weeks of use I do not see any improvement whatsoever in the darkness of the few spots I originally purchased the products to correct.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I expected a clear serum though.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I hoping for even more.</li>
            <li> The solution is peeling away the top layers of skin.</li>

            <li> I had hoped I would see more results than I have in this time frame.  </li>
            <li> Others have been more resistant but seem lighter.  </li>
            <li> Not too sure yet but still trying</li>
            <li> but i need to get more it cleard my face</li>
            <li> Some spots have disappeared, others are more stubborn.  </li>

            <li> I have tried a many of products and none can beat this.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and smell.  </li>
            <li> , I will try one more bottle.</li>
            <li> Okay I have been using for about a month.</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t think I will order any more.</li>
            <li> bought two bottles and have used most of it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered another bottle and hope to see even better results with more time.  </li>
            <li> It has done a better job than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> ,I got this one,I love that it came on time.looking forward to the result.  </li>
            <li> In any case I will purchase more because by skin likes it.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and is very lite.</li>
            <li> This product has been really great so far!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was worried that I might have a reaction to the corrector, but I experienced no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and good for your skin.</li>
            <li> It really is that good.</li>
            <li> I will try and update this after I have been able to try it for a longer period, but was too excited not to share my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin looks healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using it since I am seeing good, steady results.</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance, felt good on the skin, but did nothing to lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> Ad in Amazon says the Best Dark Spot Corrector.  </li>
            <li> BEST DARK SPOT CORRECTOR!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing is all i can say ~&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have tried many products promising to fade darks spots for review and for the most part i have been pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, at first I was a skeptic.  </li>
            <li> The product is advertised as: \\&quot;The Best Dark Spot Corrector.  </li>
            <li> When they named this product\\&quot; The Best Dark Spot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great for most people, judging by the other reviews, but as stated in the product description, there are some that it is ineffective on.</li>
            <li> and I was super excited to get a complimentary bottle of this The One and share my honest and unbiased opinion with it here with you.</li>
            <li> and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it came in a pump dispenser rather than a dropper, but I had a pump dispenser that I made fit the bottle</li>
            <li> so I am happy enough.  </li>
            <li> I have melasma, so I have light discoloration splotches all over my face.</li>
            <li> And I cannot say this serum had done anything but lightly hydrate my skin.  </li>
            <li> The lotion goes on smoothly and dries virtually immediately.  </li>
            <li> So far not so good.  </li>
            <li> I bought it based on the good reviews and the fact that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> Looks good so far.</li>
            <li> This product is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I made a video of the day I started using it as I was excited to get started and wanted to see the results and also keep a vlog.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your face first for maximum absorbency.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product home and getting results.  </li>
            <li> I have seen significant results from this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This product has significantly lightened some discoloration that I had on my face.  </li>
            <li> The One has lightened it up more than 3/4 with the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product feels silky smooth as it goes on and it absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it applied thinly to my clean face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that there were so many positive reviews from others that claim they saw immediate results</li>
            <li> &quot; they were right on!</li>
            <li> There is no bad odor at all and the formula seems to be nice and soft.</li>
            <li> But the future looks bright (pun intended)</li>
            <li> I still have to have patients for me to truly see the full effect of the product.</li>
            <li> The marks are much lighter and have lost most of their color.  </li>
            <li> After using the solution and letting it soak in, then put on some good facial cream to keep area moist.</li>
            <li> most of it really does work if you use it like it says to use.</li>
            <li> However, the company contacted me immediately and provided a full refund.</li>
            <li> I have a body that is full of freckles.</li>
            <li> Make it sound too good to be true and charge an enormous amount for it and that should make it work right?</li>
            <li> Worked pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> I have a mild case of rosacea and it just made my face break out.  </li>
            <li> Seller shipped QUICKLY and was A+ ALL THE WAY!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have notice a huge change after the first bottle</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Also, it would be good to let us know how long after&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am definitely getting more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and have noticed that my skin is smoother, more supple and most importantly the dark spots on the side of my face have started to fade.</li>
            <li> used the whole bottle it did not work!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it because I do not see any real changes!!</li>
            <li> Yes so far I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love that the product is so natural and that I don&#x27;t have to worry about any harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I am a young 62 years old and fair skinned.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results so far</li>
            <li> I love that it has all natural ingredients, so you dont have to worry about chemicals going on your skin.</li>
            <li> I honestly did not see a difference after three weeks of religiously applying this product twice a day!</li>
            <li> I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> Okay, I received this early January 2015 and have used it faithfully since I received it.</li>
            <li> Morning and night application to fresh skin, sunscreen and visors during the day.  </li>
            <li> the item was worth using.</li>
            <li> I feel as though I was tricked into buying this product by other purchasers who were encouraged to give feedback before they had time to give the product a fair trial.  </li>
            <li> I tried a bottle of this product and noticed some results right away.  </li>
            <li> With that many years working in the sun with no sun screen I ended up with major sun spots.</li>
            <li> I feel that The One makes it an easy choice with the perks of making this product with 98% of some of the highest quality natural ingredients, is made in an FDA regulated facility, has no parabens or sulfates and comes with a 100% product satisfaction guarantee!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much and bottle wasn&#x27;t full when purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report, that the one spot I tested it on for the past week is showing a change in color.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a go due to all the good reviews it has, and I must say that it really does work!  </li>
            <li> So far so good, red spots on arms started even out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a good sense how long it should normally take for a spot removal product to work</li>
            <li> so I am sure that this will last a nice long time.  </li>
            <li> and this is a very gentle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to try this product again, maybe takes time to see this product to work.</li>
            <li> It took about two weeks before I noticed the spots were fading, but I was also not using the product as consistently during this time.</li>
            <li> Just about done with my first  bottle.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the first 2 ingredients are water and witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Witch hazel has many benefits for skin such as fighting acne, locking in moisture, treating bruises and even helping to heal eczema and psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can definitely tell that my skin is in much better condition than before I started using this serum.</li>
            <li> I also recommend it to you, it really works!</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> After all, it has taken several years for these spots to become a permanent fixture on my skin so perhaps it will take a bit more time to erase them.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps in 6 weeks I can change this to a higher rating.</li>
            <li> fast!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27; used it for long but am starting to see some fading so that is great.</li>
            <li> following the  directions carefully, I really hoped it would make a difference!!!!, but there was no change for me.</li>
            <li> It is really a relief to know that some skin damage can be reversed with the right product.  </li>
            <li> product is exactly as described, visible improvement, fast results, would and will most likely buy again</li>
            <li> If I start seeing positive results, I&#x27;ll edit my review</li>
            <li> I could spend $5,000 on a procedure at my plastic surgeons to only maybe make my melasma better or a reasonable amount with this product and get real results.</li>
            <li> First corrector that removed old acne scars!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product less than a week and am already seeming amazing results.</li>
            <li> I have a large sun spot on my forearm, and I started using caster oil on this mark...</li>
            <li> I even went above and beyond by using band-aids to make sure none of the solution came off in bed or during the day for the new application.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t bother my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much result</li>
            <li> no one really is looking/noticing except me.</li>
            <li> Although the spot is still there, it is much easier to cover with concealer than it was before.  </li>
            <li> but it really does work for &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;...which can be classified as age spots, right?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking for faster results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, you really have nothing to lose trying this product.</li>
            <li> Great company that stands behind its products.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> She convinced me that she is a real person and the cream worked for her.  </li>
            <li> the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it REALLY WORKED.  </li>
            <li> However, the company was very responsive</li>
            <li> but the signs are very encouraging.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been \\&quot;Best\\&quot; for me, as I can readily observe the product working since I began using it approximately&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Of course everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so results will be different, but if you are looking for an effective brown spot treatment, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion, aside from a few freckles on my face due to sun damage over the years.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of the product before the marks went away completely, but I definitely saw significant improvement!  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to recieve this product for free in the exchange of my personal unbias review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product religiously on three spots on my forehead twice a day for 2 full months.  </li>
            <li> but nothing changed, maybe it still need more time to work on my dark spot, will keep using anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of full disclosure I&#x27;ve been sent an email with a discount coupon by the seller which I expect to use;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW from a compete stranger, I wouldn&#x27;t use the coupon or purchase the item a second time&lt;br /&gt;unless</li>
            <li> it will be more money down the drain&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> It just helps you to feel more comfortable ordering knowing that a company stands behind their product.  </li>
            <li> the dropper also is not very good.a clear bottle and a ceam would be better</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products &amp; this is the ONLY one that actually worked.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have not Seen any great imorovement,maybe dark spots a little lighter but not what I was hoping for, I use this product morning and evening .</li>
            <li> Good value, a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> I got this product to review and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> but I do want them to be gentle to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am very into natural products, so</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your precious money on this one.</li>
            <li> I intend to continue using them for a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li> The corrector lotion is very lightweight, dries rather quickly, and my favorite perk is it is in a dark blue bottle, which means it will last longer.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money &amp; lasts a very long time, you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> This product is working much faster and is lightening the dark spots significantly.</li>
            <li> I get easily bitten by no seeums and mosquitoes and it leaves a dark spot on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> A little slower going that expected but a good product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t live up to the claim for me.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try and have been very surprised with my results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shopped at Amazon for years, but this is the first time that Amazon AND a rep from the manufacturer have emailed me shortly after the product arrived to request a rating.  </li>
            <li> Oh my wow!  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Finally a product that really does work!</li>
            <li> It is looking more like the other (lighter) freckles around the same spot.</li>
            <li> I finally get it delivered,I didnt get the first order that I placed,Yaye</li>
            <li> it does not work on my dark spots even after more than a month constantly used it.</li>
            <li> I use it two times daily and the spot&#x27;s became more dark</li>
            <li> The dark spots on my face have lightened significantly.</li>
            <li> I have ordered another bottle for my wife to try.&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware of the fact that when you first put the solution on that you may experience a slight itching or burning sensation for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am going to use this product until it&#x27;s done but as far as dec.</li>
            <li> and I know not everything works for everyone but as far as I can see it&#x27;s not made a difference for me.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;nt just give up on this natural ingredient product.</li>
            <li> People always think my eye makeup is smeared and try to wipe it off because it is near the corner of my eye.  </li>
            <li> I hope that with continued use the spot will go away completely.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that the color is milky.</li>
            <li> But in the area I use this product , my skin has never been as soft as it is now that I am using The One.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use that they&#x27;ll be gone completely, yet</li>
            <li> This is a complete rip off so far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s seems like it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Has it completely removed All my brown spots?  </li>
            <li> It is made from natural ingredients and does not contain hydroquinone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the spots completely fade away with repeated use.  </li>
            <li> I started out using it daily, but thought that it may have been too much and began using it three times a week during my nightly skin routine.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you that I have had no harsh side effects from this product</li>
            <li> The spots have lightened so much in just a short time!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is worth a shot, especially since the ingredients aren&#x27;t harmful.  </li>
            <li> So many products claim that it will take away the dark spots but they barely fade, this one on the other hand, really does work!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise the dark areas return just as quickly.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results - and a little bit goes a LONG way</li>
            <li> I am very faired skinned and worshipped the Sun for far too long in my youth.  </li>
            <li> I have some dark spots and freckles and over the 30 day application I expected to see a better result.  </li>
            <li> It works, not super quickly, but with time you can see the improvement.</li>
            <li> I use to be so self conscious of some scars I had on my legs, but at this point I can barely see them .  </li>
            <li> With so many products out there claiming to do all the same things its hard to pick which one to use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I was having dark circles because of lack of sleep, I do have restless legs and that keeps me up a lot, but even after trying a sleep aid and getting more sleep, i still had dark circles.</li>
            <li> The size of this bottle is quite big, meaning this product will last you quite a while because you don&#x27;t use much of it.</li>
            <li> I hope I don&#x27;t get a whole lot more age spots because it could get expensive -</li>
            <li> This isnt a miracle over night cure, but over the course of 12 days the circles under my eyes have reduced 75% which is a MAJOR improvement</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t notice major change and I been using it for about 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have finished the first bottom and going to buy the other bottom</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products with just a little result.</li>
            <li> They were barely noticeable!</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s just as dark after using more than half of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked about all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried this, it appeared that my dark spots were getting lighter but upon closer inspection</li>
            <li> I noticed results from this product clearing my dark spots in the first week.</li>
            <li> This product went on oily and clogged my pores near my eyes, creating multiple Stye</li>
            <li> Spent too much time in the sun.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product only 3 stars because, so far, it has not done what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li> (Even on those spots it&#x27;s barely noticeable. )</li>
            <li> Cannot comment on dark spot correction feature yet, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference!</li>
            <li> I am going to order more and begin using it on my hands and arms which have begun to get a few dark spots as well.  </li>
            <li> What does seems to be happening with my skin is a noticeable \\&quot;lightening or toning\\&quot; of my entire face, which in itself is not bad, but is not what I wanted, i.e. to reduce the degree of darkness in just a few spots.  </li>
            <li> The other two products that I ordered from this site&#x27;s are:  Vernal HYALURONIC ACID PURE and Belitae Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I gave this product a two star review which may be a little harsh.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days so that&#x27;s why I am only giving it 4 stars as I don&#x27;t know what the full results will be.</li>
            <li> Although I love my freckled body, there are some spots that are very dark, and or uneven looking.</li>
            <li> Really works, removes all dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have tried a dark spot corrector from a salon and it didn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li> and I believe with long term use, it will help clear up the spots&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> That was until after the first few days had passed - there was a visible difference in the appearance of the circles that used to claim their space.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it has brightened up my entire face and after only a few days of use has begun to reduce those freckles or dark spots around my nose!  </li>
            <li> I however do have high hopes from his product based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> In that short period of time I can say that I can not see much of a difference in the dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li> Only one scar was really dark and that one is much lighter.  </li>
            <li> I can see a slight improvement in the \\&quot;tone\\&quot; of my face but after three weeks of use I do not see any improvement whatsoever in the darkness of the few spots I originally purchased the products to correct.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I expected a clear serum though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was going to be the last product I would ever try out, I was giving up and was just going to live with my dark spots....</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of dark spots, uneven skin tone and have soft supple</li>
            <li> Perhaps my expectations were a little too high for the delivered result....</li>
            <li> It will take time to see if the dark spots actually do fade, but so far I like this product</li>
            <li> Since starting to use this dark spot remover nearly twice a day in December, there has been no noticeable change.</li>
            <li> The sun spot on my arm has lightened by at least 50% (though I&#x27;m not sure I can expect any more improvement.)  </li>
            <li> But I did get an email from the manufacturer about the ingredients being all natural, so the fading of dark spots may take longer to be noticed.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s going to do the work</li>
            <li> , I may  not have used the product long enough to give it a chance to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one, being less harmful and mostly natural</li>
            <li> I can already see the dark spots on my face getting much lighter, much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that a red spot on my face that I have had for years faded, and some other dark spots have lightened.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots were barely changed.</li>
            <li> and I have several dark spots about the same lite brown color as my freckles.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product to see if long term use makes any difference.  </li>
            <li> After one month of use, I have seen a definite reduction in the darkness of my spots, however, they are certainly not gone.  </li>
            <li> They are not raised scars, so to speak, but they are darkened areas of my skin due to always having acne in the same spots.  </li>
            <li> I massage a dime size amount into my face for 2 minutes and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of products in the last few years with various results.</li>
            <li> I have some sun spots on my upper chest, back of hands and few on my temples (years of living in Florida).  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product at this price as it does not live up to the overblown claims made by the manufacturers.</li>
            <li> I just am the average person who needs instant gratification.  </li>
            <li> I actually got this in hopes it would work on the dark circles I have under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It helped me with my acne and treated dark spots (I still have some, but using facial strips for those).</li>
            <li> , The dark circles only look darker when they are shiny with the oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for several weeks and there is no improvement with my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have used several products expecting that they would lighten the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this, along with sunblock, to prevent further dark spots.  </li>
            <li> The dark spots haven&#x27;t disappeared, but they&#x27;re definitely fading.  </li>
            <li> I used 4weeks not different my dark spot.</li>
            <li> u still have the same dark spots no my legs wont buy again</li>
            <li> I have multiple dark skin areas from injury and biopsy.  </li>
            <li> and i will purchase two fade that last dark spot.  </li>
            <li> Some of the 2.5% retinol products gave me only a little improvement.</li>
            <li> Prior to using Dark Spot I was using Clinique Dark Spot Removal.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s taking longer than I expected and my bottle is running out soon.</li>
            <li> used daily and never touched the age  spot, waste of money</li>
            <li> The product is slow to remove the spots but it definitely works with careful twice daily application.  </li>
            <li> I have religiously applied all three advertised dark spot correctors twice daily to the few dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have put this on various acne spots twice a day for a few days and like I said I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the spots</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple other serums with no results so this has helped a little.</li>
            <li> After two months and a near empty bottle - we declared this experiment a failure.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, everyday and it is actually  fading my dark spots called, Hyperpigmentation caused by my lupus.</li>
            <li> Maybe other purchasers opted to say it worked before they had any tangible results.</li>
            <li> There is no redness or irritation which I have have seen with other products.</li>
            <li> I however checked out other reviews.</li>
            <li> This product might work for other people but it does not for me.</li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t work for 4 other people</li>
            <li> Then other spots have not changed at all.  </li>
            <li> have tried other OTC brown spot treatments, like Clinique&#x27;s product and another one with hydroquinone, and neither worked as well as \\&quot;The One\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who wants to get rid of those irritating dark spots!</li>
            <li> I am now five (5) weeks after purchase, see no noticeable difference in my dark spots and Amazon says I am nine (9) days past the final return date.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks now, simultaneous along with two other products advertised to diminish dark spots on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have two dark spots on my cheeks due to over exposure to the sun and they have not lightened at all.  </li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my face and hands</li>
            <li> My dark spots are vanishing.  </li>
            <li> Still, no problems using the product and it might even be lightening my sun-damaged dark spots, though they are not gone.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of sun damage and have tried EVERYTHING to fade these dark spots.</li>
            <li> Dark spots are as dark as ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of my dark spots from post-acne for months.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s pricey!), but it unfortunately did not do much.</li>
            <li> Used it for 6 months and did not improve dark spots  on hand</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my dark spots</li>
            <li> I know it says its for age spots, dark spots and sun spots etc</li>
            <li> I used this dark spot corrector as instructed.  </li>
            <li> I noticed no change whatsoever in my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all in fading dark spot or smoothening skin</li>
            <li> I faithfully used this product as suggested in the directions for use, but sadly my dark spots remain, unchanged.  </li>
            <li> I have used a couple of dark spot correctors.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest problems I have with my face is dark spots from when I had an acne flare up.</li>
            <li> I began my search for a dark spot corrector when I found this one at a discounted price.</li>
            <li> They have gone from a dark purple color to a lighter brown color.</li>
            <li> The One Dark Spot Corrector was sent to me to test and review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for a couple of days to help with dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> So I dont have a lot of dark spots on my face...</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product for the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to lighten or remove my dark spots.</li>
            <li> All three products were advertised to help diminish dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Master Pro 127 is in one of your product for dark foggy on Waze for the dark spots that are on my hands</li>
            <li> I started using Dark Spot 3 weeks ago twice a day faithfully.  </li>
            <li> I have not notice any lightning of the dark spots on my skin at all.</li>
            <li> There has been some lightning of spots that are not quite as dark.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I have not had much lightening.  </li>
            <li> The dark spots on my face have gotten lighter.  </li>
            <li> Has worked to diminish some dark spots, the marks are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> All my life I have been ridden with dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The DArk Spot CORRECTOR does not work I used it for a month</li>
            <li> “The One” Dark Spot Corrector by Nature Science Labs is a skin brightener, and is designed to lighten age spots (liver spots).  </li>
            <li> they are dark.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of apply the cream I&#x27;ve seem some reduction of my dark spot.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it to see if it fully removes the dark spot.</li>
            <li> i do not see any change in the dark spot on my face.  </li>
            <li> I got this product in the hopes that it would lighten some dark spots and on the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had a dark spot around my chest area, and it seems to be diminishing.</li>
            <li> This stuff did not do a thing to reduce or eliminate the dark spots on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> The dark spots on my husband&#x27;s face have decreased markedly and he intends to continue using it as per bottle directions.</li>
            <li> I started using this dark spot corrector and it is less noticeable than it was before.  </li>
            <li> Now, I did see slight reduction in dark knees but not a lot.</li>
            <li> The bottle is half used and this product hasn&#x27;t touched my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> They are still there, but are much less pronounced.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work, I used it for two and a half months.</li>
            <li> Slight fading.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dark spot but over one month not any change still heavy dark spot I give up no use anymore</li>
            <li> I can see slight improvement on the brown spots on my hands in just one week&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li> It has only been 3 weeks; I see no markedly significant difference in the dark spot correction, but there is some subtle improvement.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had high hopes and it didn&#x27;t quite do</li>
            <li> I bought this product 2 months ago, so i wanted to write a review a little ways down the road.  </li>
            <li> in just a few days my dark spots lightened...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product but felt comfortable buying it since I read it could be returned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 &amp; have had a few dark spots on my face for years from sun damage.</li>
            <li> Still in the review stage for my wife; it is a long process, and , slow going.</li>
            <li> I still have the little dots all over my cheeks &amp; made my face a bit oily.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and we did a little experiment.  </li>
            <li> After using this product to lighten the dark circles under  my eyes and lighten the freckles on my face, all I got was a couple of Stye in both my eyes!</li>
            <li> No need to spend tons of money on fancy ingredients in other products when this works just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> After using it twice a day as per directions little or anything changed, would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I been used this for 2 weeks and see the little result and it might take little longer on me and wait to see.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about two weeks now and can already see a difference in the dark spots on my cheeks and chin!</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> Two of them are very dark since they sit on my cheekbone.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot on my face that I&#x27;m not sure what caused it.  </li>
            <li> However, I have not seen any difference in my marks after having used the product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a few freckles on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday since I got it.</li>
            <li> Pricey and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used to always hide my eyes behind sunglasses whenever possible, to avoid people saying &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li> It says satisfaction guaranteed if you are not happy within 367 days they will return it no questions asked, but there is only a 30 day return allowed and you don&#x27;t even know yet if it will work in that time.</li>
            <li> and it is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference, wasted money</li>
            <li> the dark bottle makes it impossible to see how much is being used.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a small lightening of a few spots but whether it will substantially reduce he spots has yet to be seen.</li>
            <li> I had quite a few small spots all over my face.</li>
            <li> Have been using this products for 2 months now and my dark spots are fading slowly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have those ugly dark spots I see on some older people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> NONE!&lt;br /&gt;I was doubtful buying this creams because of plentiful fake testimonials about all kind of products for women.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot, just a little amount will do!</li>
            <li> I have serious dark spots on both of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> You just dab a small amount on the target area and let it soak in.  </li>
            <li> Small bottle, buy 2 if you have anything but a couple of small spots.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but because it was priced low, like around $30, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> and Im not completely satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 4 weeks</li>
            <li> Now, apply your usual moisturizer or sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> may be a bit lighter but not sure.</li>
            <li> Small bumps under my skin</li>
            <li> I heal very slowly and the Dark Spot has helped somewhat.  </li>
            <li> I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
            <li> Not effective at all...</li>
            <li> Results slow.</li>
            <li> There is not a huge dramatic difference yet but nothing works over night</li>
            <li> I thought that this product would do the trick, but sadly, the dark marks are still there.</li>
            <li> product does seem to help though seriously.</li>
            <li> I am in my late fifties and age spots started to show up on my hands - big, dark brown spots - and I hated them.  </li>
            <li> Feel skeptical about all these products that claim to lighten dark spots since none appear to work for me at all!</li>
            <li> I have used it twice a day since it arrived , but alas.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed very subtle changes.</li>
            <li> NO GOOD!</li>
            <li> After letting the product soak in for a bit, I covered it with an expensive lotion (that I have used for years without issue).</li>
            <li> When I got this product for testing and review, I was bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I fell into that category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is expensive and ineffective.</li>
            <li> may be expensive</li>
            <li> These horrible spots on my face are actually disappearing...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in Dark Spot!</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s too late to return it!!!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> False advertising and bad product!</li>
            <li> &#x27;s why I have a bad taste in my mouth about this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a bad product</li>
            <li> For me this one was not the remedy I had hoped so fervently for :(  </li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Worthless, used it for three weeks and son no improvement.</li>
            <li> After using it for about two weeks my face began to itch terribly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even lightening a horrible acne scar I never thought I&#x27;d be rid of.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok, I gave this product a two star review which may be a little harsh.  Perhaps my expectations were a little too high for the delivered result....this is not to say that many of you who use this product will not be happy-I just am the average person who needs instant gratification.  I have some dark spots and freckles and over the 30 day application I expected to see a better result.  I will continue using the product as, perhaps I need 60 days.  You need to use a sunscreen with this product which everyone should be doing anyway.</li>
            <li> It has only been 3 weeks; I see no markedly significant difference in the dark spot correction, but there is some subtle improvement.  I use it 2x daily.</li>
            <li> I recieved this for my opinion , seems to work I have dark spots on my face and hands and it helps lighten them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product less than a week and am already seeming amazing results.</li>
            <li> Received this March 13, 2015 &amp; started using it twice a day &amp; can not tell any difference yet.</li>
            <li> I suppose not everything works for everyone. Unfortunately I had high hopes and it didn&#x27;t quite do it&#x27;s job. I still have the little dots all over my cheeks &amp; made my face a bit oily.</li>
            <li> I been using this more then a week now and I can say that its working and doing what it says. I still have to have patients for me to truly see the full effect of the product. But I love it and I will order again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product..in just a few days my dark spots lightened...love the results of THE ONE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works for sure. I bought this product 2 months ago, so i wanted to write a review a little ways down the road.  It say it takes two weeks, but i say you can notice a difference in about a month or so, I am of brown skin, you can definitely tell the difference when the brown spots fades away.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> So far so good, red spots on arms started even out. Looks getting better and better. I&#x27;m ordering more to see more better</li>
            <li> I have tried it for 30 days, I do see some difference but I think it&#x27;s too soon to tell.  I am going to try for one more month. I like that it does not contain chemicals.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much and bottle wasn&#x27;t full when purchased.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this, it appeared that my dark spots were getting lighter but upon closer inspection, It&#x27;s just as dark after using more than half of the bottle. Regardless, I did order another bottle so hopefully, it will lighten my spots for this price. I&#x27;m amazed that there were so many positive reviews from others that claim they saw immediate results and that&#x27;s why I ordered another bottle. If I start seeing positive results, I&#x27;ll edit my review but until then, I&#x27;m crossing my fingers and hoping for the best! I am following the directions by using twice a day and applying a sun screen but it&#x27;s taking longer than I expected and my bottle is running out soon. Feel skeptical about all these products that claim to lighten dark spots since none appear to work for me at all!</li>
            <li> It does not happen overnight.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much result but I&#x27;m planning to purchase another bottle as soon as it&#x27;s finished, maybe if I use two bottles on a constant basic I will see better results.</li>
            <li> I feel as though I was tricked into buying this product by other purchasers who were encouraged to give feedback before they had time to give the product a fair trial.  I have been using this product religiously on three spots on my forehead twice a day for 2 full months.  ZERO results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an experiment, I decided at the same time to use a folk medicine &amp;#34;remedy&amp;#34;.  I have a large sun spot on my forearm, and I started using caster oil on this mark...twice a day also.  The sun spot on my arm has lightened by at least 50% (though I&#x27;m not sure I can expect any more improvement.)  The spot on my arm was darker than the ones on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I have a bad taste in my mouth about this product.  I&#x27;ve shopped at Amazon for years, but this is the first time that Amazon AND a rep from the manufacturer have emailed me shortly after the product arrived to request a rating.  Even if the stuff worked, it would take longer than a week.  So while I was optimistic that &amp;#34;The One&amp;#34; would help me, I resisted the urge to write a review too soon.  Maybe other purchasers opted to say it worked before they had any tangible results.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been asked repeatedly by the creators of this product to give a review before I see results here goes... I started using this product on December 9th and I have not seen any results. I made a video of the day I started using it as I was excited to get started and wanted to see the results and also keep a vlog. I just did a video the day after Christmas and my face looks the same. I have been using it everyday and I think only two nights I didn&#x27;t use it but I use it every morning during my face routine. I even started applying it to my bikini area because I have some razor bump scars on the bikini line and still no change. I am going to use this product until it&#x27;s done but as far as dec. 9th -Dec 30th I&#x27;ve seen no change in my acne scars. I was probably looking for a miracle and when I didn&#x27;t see any results by the 26th I started to cry and thought I was being cursed because nothing I&#x27;ve tried has been working. I hope this review helps anyone who is Looking to see results in the two weeks that others are raving about. I don&#x27;t think this is a bad product and I know not everything works for everyone but as far as I can see it&#x27;s not made a difference for me.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen any improvements yet.  I will give it another two weeks or so.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;nt just give up on this natural ingredient product.Maybe it takes another bottle to see results. I&#x27;m willing to try this product again, maybe takes time to see this product to work.</li>
            <li> After only 4 uses, I already see a big difference. My dark spots are vanishing.  Love this Product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks and I am noticing some facing of brown spots. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Advertising does not match labeling.  Ad in Amazon says the Best Dark Spot Corrector.  This differs from the product label, which says it is a Skin Brightener.  Also, the ingredients do not include Kukupu Plum, and that is what I was led to believe the product contained, since that is what I searched on in Amazon.  Still, no problems using the product and it might even be lightening my sun-damaged dark spots, though they are not gone.  Will keep using through the winter, nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product and plan to order it again. The dark spots on my face have lightened significantly. They are still there, but are much less pronounced. I have sensitive skin and was worried that I might have a reaction to the corrector, but I experienced no adverse reaction. I would recommend giving this product a try.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions. I even went above and beyond by using band-aids to make sure none of the solution came off in bed or during the day for the new application. Over 30 days, the brown spots are still there-no change. A friend said &amp;#34;Who noticed them or mentioned them to you?&amp;#34; Well, no one. I got the point- no one really is looking/noticing except me. I believe Robert Redford is the correct example for aging. Just accept yourself as you are!</li>
            <li> Product did not work.  I have a mild case of rosacea and it just made my face break out.  Used about 5 times.  NO GOOD!</li>
            <li> This product works!  It took about two weeks before I noticed the spots were fading, but I was also not using the product as consistently during this time. I have a lot of sun damage and have tried EVERYTHING to fade these dark spots. Nothing worked, but this product does!  I am definitely getting more!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work, I used it for two and a half months.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product feels silky smooth as it goes on and it absorbs quickly into my skin. There is no redness or irritation which I have have seen with other products.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and we did a little experiment.  After two months and a near empty bottle - we declared this experiment a failure.  The directions were followed explicitly, but the effects were minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects.</li>
            <li> BEST DARK SPOT CORRECTOR!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing is all i can say ~&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products promising to fade darks spots for review and for the most part i have been pleased with them.  BUT~ This one works! I have pictures!  I use it twice a day, everyday and it is actually  fading my dark spots called, Hyperpigmentation caused by my lupus. It has also helped my racoon eyes!  Its plant based, no GMO&#x27;s and Gluten free.&lt;br /&gt;All i can say is amaxing! Proof is in the pictures!</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot on my face that I&#x27;m not sure what caused it.  People always think my eye makeup is smeared and try to wipe it off because it is near the corner of my eye.  I started using this dark spot corrector and it is less noticeable than it was before.  You just dab a small amount on the target area and let it soak in.  Make sure you wash your face first for maximum absorbency.  I have used it religiously for a week. Although the spot is still there, it is much easier to cover with concealer than it was before.  I hope that with continued use the spot will go away completely.  I purchased this product during a promotion for trial and review purposes.</li>
            <li> So far not so good.  Dark spots are as dark as ever and I have been very regular applying it for about the last 3 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of my dark spots from post-acne for months. Thought this product would finally do it (it&#x27;s pricey!), but it unfortunately did not do much. I regret the purchase, but I also acknowledge the fact that what may work for others may not work for me.</li>
            <li> Used it for 6 months and did not improve dark spots  on hand</li>
            <li> It is not working at all for my case.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have 5 visible age and sun spots on my face.  Two of them are very dark since they sit on my cheekbone.  Took Before and After pictures.  After maybe 4-5 weeks, zero difference and used as label directs.  Not purchasing again, good luck to those who buy these.  Glad it did work for some people!</li>
            <li> After using it for about two weeks my face began to itch terribly.  I quit using it and immediately the itching ceased.  I guess I must be allergic to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my dark spots</li>
            <li> I actually got this in hopes it would work on the dark circles I have under my eyes. I received this at a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it only about 4 days now but I am definitely noticing a difference. I didn&#x27;t know if I was having dark circles because of lack of sleep, I do have restless legs and that keeps me up a lot, but even after trying a sleep aid and getting more sleep, i still had dark circles. I&#x27;ll bame them on my kids and aging :-)&lt;br /&gt;This product does seem to help though seriously. I know it says its for age spots, dark spots and sun spots etc but it really does work for &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;...which can be classified as age spots, right?&lt;br /&gt;I say give it a try. It works for me and I hope it works just as well for you too.&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to add that this product has a nice scent to it and has not irritated my skin at all. Arrived fast and packaged great! Will get this roduct again!</li>
            <li> I used this dark spot corrector as instructed.  It did not work for me.  I noticed no change whatsoever in my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all in fading dark spot or smoothening skin.. was a mistake</li>
            <li> I notice big changes after using this product for a couple of weeks. It helped me with my acne and treated dark spots (I still have some, but using facial strips for those). Skin looks healthy and clean. Will buy again! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Small bottle, buy 2 if you have anything but a couple of small spots. Results slow. Slight fading.</li>
            <li> Yes so far I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Just about done with my first  bottle.  But I did get an email from the manufacturer about the ingredients being all natural, so the fading of dark spots may take longer to be noticed.  I&#x27;m really looking for faster results. It may work if I stick with it though.</li>
            <li> Have noticed a big difference in using the product, the bottle is gone, still use it twice a day, seen spots on the skin that is gone.  Notice a big difference in the skin area where its applied.  Will purchase more soon.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any reduction of color on my hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product but felt comfortable buying it since I read it could be returned.  I am now five (5) weeks after purchase, see no noticeable difference in my dark spots and Amazon says I am nine (9) days past the final return date.  I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this if I knew the return period was only 30-days.</li>
            <li> Really works, removes all dark spots.</li>
            <li> I noticed results from this product clearing my dark spots in the first week. I have been using it for a month and all my spots are almost gone. It seemed to help with any acne spots I had developing as well.</li>
            <li> After using this product to lighten the dark circles under  my eyes and lighten the freckles on my face, all I got was a couple of Stye in both my eyes! This product went on oily and clogged my pores near my eyes, creating multiple Stye, The dark circles only look darker when they are shiny with the oil. After letting the product soak in for a bit, I covered it with an expensive lotion (that I have used for years without issue).</li>
            <li> I have a lot of sun damage on my hands, arms and legs. Spent too much time in the sun. I used the entire bottle and it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference at all.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Used as directed for five weeks. Pleasant fragrance, felt good on the skin, but did nothing to lighten dark spots. Will not purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for several weeks and there is no improvement with my dark spots. I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I faithfully used this product as suggested in the directions for use, but sadly my dark spots remain, unchanged.  For me this one was not the remedy I had hoped so fervently for :(  There was no change for me.  I intend to contact the seller for resolution.</li>
            <li> product is exactly as described, visible improvement, fast results, would and will most likely buy again</li>
            <li> I got this product to review and so far I really like it. There is no bad odor at all and the formula seems to be nice and soft. It will take time to see if the dark spots actually do fade, but so far I like this product and I will definitely use it daily.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple of dark spot correctors. They did not work for me. When I got this product for testing and review, I was bit skeptical. I however checked out other reviews. Especially those reviews with photos. That’s what set me to get this product. I have used this product for couple of days now. I do not use it on face. I use it on my elbows and knees. Now, I did see slight reduction in dark knees but not a lot. I however do have high hopes from his product based on other reviews. I will continue to use this and will update my review in couple of weeks with more information. Hence the reason for four star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions. I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
            <li> It works well i recommend it.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest problems I have with my face is dark spots from when I had an acne flare up. I began my search for a dark spot corrector when I found this one at a discounted price. I decided to give it a try and have been very surprised with my results. I noticed that the first 2 ingredients are water and witch hazel. Witch hazel has many benefits for skin such as fighting acne, locking in moisture, treating bruises and even helping to heal eczema and psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and have noticed that my skin is smoother, more supple and most importantly the dark spots on the side of my face have started to fade. They have gone from a dark purple color to a lighter brown color. There is not a huge dramatic difference yet but nothing works over night and I can definitely tell that my skin is in much better condition than before I started using this serum. I was surprised to see that the color is milky. I don&#x27;t know why I expected a clear serum though. I massage a dime size amount into my face for 2 minutes and then let it air dry. It always soaks into my skin perfectly and does not leave my skin greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this during my morning and night time routine and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks now but til now i didnt notice any change i will continue using it twice a day hoping by time i will get bettwr results.</li>
            <li> I had a bunch of red and purple splotches on my legs (leftover scars from a skin infection,) and started using this in the hopes that it would help fade the marks before summer.  I ran out of the product before the marks went away completely, but I definitely saw significant improvement!  The marks are much lighter and have lost most of their color.  I love that the product is so natural and that I don&#x27;t have to worry about any harmful chemicals.  I&#x27;m definitely reordering!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It started working in 5 days, with no skin irritations</li>
            <li> My daughter became a fan of this stuff. It lighten up her acne spots a lot. This stuff will lighten your face or any discoloration you may have. This is a good product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> it does not work on my dark spots even after more than a month constantly used it.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks, there is no change. This product might work for other people but it does not for me.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is outstanding. The product did not work on me, so I requested a refund and I received it the same day. I&#x27;m sure it works great for most people, judging by the other reviews, but as stated in the product description, there are some that it is ineffective on. Unfortunately, I fell into that category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you really have nothing to lose trying this product. It either works, or it doesn&#x27;t and you can get a refund. Great company that stands behind its products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and have used this product since February of this year. However, I&#x27;ve not noticed any of the promised results.  The product is expensive and ineffective. I do not recommend this product at this price as it does not live up to the overblown claims made by the manufacturers.</li>
            <li> The One Dark Spot Corrector was sent to me to test and review. I really do like this product. It has a pleasant scent and is very lite. Not greasy at all. NaturaScienceLabs has done a great job with this product. They recommend that you use The One 2 times a day for several weeks. Now I have only been using this product for 4 days. In that short period of time I can say that I can not see much of a difference in the dark spot on my face. But in the area I use this product , my skin has never been as soft as it is now that I am using The One. I honestly do believe that this product will work for me. So I will continue to use it! It works with all skin types. It is a clinically proven Advance Formula Skin Brightener, and I am a believer. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of dark spots, uneven skin tone and have soft supple skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karmas Reviews</li>
            <li> Did not act as advertised for me. Dark spots were barely changed.</li>
            <li> I love products that offer a money-back guarantee.  It just helps you to feel more comfortable ordering knowing that a company stands behind their product.  I have been using this now for a couple of days to help with dark circles under my eyes.  I can honestly say that I feel they are getting better. It is really a relief to know that some skin damage can be reversed with the right product.  I will try and update this after I have been able to try it for a longer period, but was too excited not to share my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rec&#x27;d by manufacturer for review consideration.</li>
            <li> used the whole bottle it did not work!!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work. don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I used this as directed and nothing! It did not work and I been using it for months!</li>
            <li> No results.  Will not order this again.</li>
            <li> I bought the product on the basis of claims made in the various reviews. However, I have not seen any difference in my marks after having used the product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!!!!  I bought it based on the good reviews and the fact that it&#x27;s natural.  I was skeptical, but because it was priced low, like around $30, I decided to give it a try.  I can already see the dark spots on my face getting much lighter, much less noticeable. It&#x27;s even lightening a horrible acne scar I never thought I&#x27;d be rid of.  I started noticing the lightening effect after about 2 weeks.  I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use that they&#x27;ll be gone completely, yet I know I need to be diligent about wearing sunscreen, as well, for this to happen.</li>
            <li> Hey, I have just started using my 2nd bottle. No miracles yet but I have noticed very subtle changes. I am a young 62 years old and fair skinned. I&#x27;ve always had a few freckles on my face and I have several dark spots about the same lite brown color as my freckles. I have used all kinds of products in the last few years with various results. I didn&#x27;t expect any of them to work overnight but I do want them to be gentle to my sensitive skin and this is a very gentle product.&lt;br /&gt;This may be expensive but you only use a drop in the morning and a drop at night so it lasts a long time. I can&#x27;t say I have notice a huge change after the first bottle but when I look in the mirror I noticed that my skin has nicer tone to it. I think the spots are softening in color. I have also noticed a big change on my freckly forearms where I have used this a couple of times. I am planning to stay with this product for a while and give it a chance to work. It&#x27;s gentle and good for your skin. I don&#x27;t want to have those ugly dark spots I see on some older people.&lt;br /&gt;You are going to age anyway so why not look your best.</li>
            <li> J.U.N.K. Don&#x27;t bother buying it. Did I mention it was JUNK?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work while I was using it....I returned it!</li>
            <li> This cream is inefficient. I bought two bottles for my mother, she had been applying it for two month on an age spot on her face.  Two months later the spot was still there and of the same darkness.  I tried it on a spot I have on my leg and gave this cream to two of my friends.  NO correction has been done to our spots.  NONE!&lt;br /&gt;I was doubtful buying this creams because of plentiful fake testimonials about all kind of products for women.  However I bought it after reading Martha&#x27;s review here on amazon.  She has before and after pictures posted but this pictures seem to be of a different brightness.  She convinced me that she is a real person and the cream worked for her.  Well, it didn&#x27;t work for 4 other people I know.&lt;br /&gt;Other than &amp;#34;spot correction&amp;#34;, the cream didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritations to either of us and it goes on smoothly.  This is why I gave it 2 stars versus zero.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve been trying creams for years.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t work for me. may work well for someone else.</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion, aside from a few freckles on my face due to sun damage over the years.  I am very into natural products, so this one, being less harmful and mostly natural I decided to give it a go due to all the good reviews it has, and I must say that it really does work!  I love the way it has brightened up my entire face and after only a few days of use has begun to reduce those freckles or dark spots around my nose!  Now that I see it works I am going to order more and begin using it on my hands and arms which have begun to get a few dark spots as well.  I am very pleased with this product and will now be a repeat customer and recommended it to my mom as well. I also recommend it to you, it really works!</li>
            <li> used daily and never touched the age  spot, waste of money</li>
            <li> First corrector that removed old acne scars!!! Really works!</li>
            <li> Worked pretty easy.  Took A good week to notice.</li>
            <li> I have used several products expecting that they would lighten the dark spots on my face. Some of the 2.5% retinol products gave me only a little improvement. This product is working much faster and is lightening the dark spots significantly. I have been using the solution for about 3 weeks. I am pleased with the results so far and I hoping for even more. I have ordered another bottle for my wife to try.&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware of the fact that when you first put the solution on that you may experience a slight itching or burning sensation for about 5 minutes. The solution is peeling away the top layers of skin. After using the solution and letting it soak in, then put on some good facial cream to keep area moist.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast so I got my order soon butthe product didnt gave me rresults.  I used it since July and Im not completely satisfied with the product.  I want a refund.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your precious money on this one. I used it for the month and didn&#x27;t see any difference at all and now it&#x27;s too late to return it!!! This is a complete rip off so far as I can tell. Make it sound too good to be true and charge an enormous amount for it and that should make it work right? WRONG!</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I have some darker spots on my chin and neck area from acne over the years.  They are not raised scars, so to speak, but they are darkened areas of my skin due to always having acne in the same spots.  I have been using this product only on the areas on my chin, but not on my neck.  Oh my wow!  There is a difference in the skin on my chin and the skin on my neck...even my husband noticed it.  He asked if I was using a different make up on that area to cover it up (because he knows how self-conscious I am about it).  I am highly impressed with this.  I have used so many products over the years, even retina-a, trying to get rid of this, but it has not helped.  This has definitely made a difference.  Now for my neck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and as of now, there is no change.</li>
            <li> So I dont have a lot of dark spots on my face... but I do have a bunch of stretchmarks on my belly. I tried not only using this on my face but my belly too. It has shown a visible difference in both. Although they are still there and you can still see them. I can tell that the marks are getting lighter and with enough time they will eventually be un-noticeable. I received this for review purposes.</li>
            <li> The product is slow to remove the spots but it definitely works with careful twice daily application.  Mine are fading although not compelte removed. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product for the dark circles under my eyes. I was lucky enough to recieve this product for free in the exchange of my personal unbias review. This isnt a miracle over night cure, but over the course of 12 days the circles under my eyes have reduced 75% which is a MAJOR improvement and you cant see them at all once i put concealer on. I cant wait to finish the bottle and see if any further improvements are made. No need to spend tons of money on fancy ingredients in other products when this works just as well if not better. By far im totally impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! It does Nothing!!! I used it twice a day for 3 weeks.  Nothing! It says 100% guarantee but it is only for 30 days and they encouraged you to use it for several weeks before you see results.  I want my money back!</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this product. Lightening is gradual, but definite. Has a nice citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dark spot but over one month not any change still heavy dark spot I give up no use anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday since I got it. I can honestly say I have seen a difference.  It works, not super quickly, but with time you can see the improvement. I use it twice a day to see results and I apply it liberally. I have a spot on my leg that I have been using it on.  This is gentle on my skin and it does not feel heavy or greasy at all. I love that it has all natural ingredients, so you dont have to worry about chemicals going on your skin. I am confident with continued use I will see the reuslts im looking for.  I would recommend this product to others. It&#x27;s definitely an  you should invest in if you have any scarring as I do, that you would like to get rid of.</li>
            <li> if it works, then it takes its time...</li>
            <li> Finally!!  Finally a product that really does work! So many products claim that it will take away the dark spots but they barely fade, this one on the other hand, really does work!&lt;br /&gt;It was going to be the last product I would ever try out, I was giving up and was just going to live with my dark spots....boy am I glad I gave this one a chance!!&lt;br /&gt;This is it!!! It doesn&#x27;t take a lot, just a little amount will do! And before you know it, the spots are disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.  Save your money.  It did nothing to lighten or remove my dark spots. Pricey and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks now, simultaneous along with two other products advertised to diminish dark spots on the skin.  I have religiously applied all three advertised dark spot correctors twice daily to the few dark spots on my face.  The other two products that I ordered from this site&#x27;s are:  Vernal HYALURONIC ACID PURE and Belitae Vitamin C Serum.  All three products were advertised to help diminish dark spots.  I can see a slight improvement in the \\&quot;tone\\&quot; of my face but after three weeks of use I do not see any improvement whatsoever in the darkness of the few spots I originally purchased the products to correct.  In the hope that these products will eventually do what they are advertised to do I intend to continue using them for a few more weeks.  After all, it has taken several years for these spots to become a permanent fixture on my skin so perhaps it will take a bit more time to erase them.  What does seems to be happening with my skin is a noticeable \\&quot;lightening or toning\\&quot; of my entire face, which in itself is not bad, but is not what I wanted, i.e. to reduce the degree of darkness in just a few spots.  I am giving this product only 3 stars because, so far, it has not done what it is advertised to do.  Perhaps in 6 weeks I can change this to a higher rating.</li>
            <li> snake oil.  Dose not remove or evenlighten the liver spots.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Bought it six weeks before a work event where I needed to look my best.  To my surprise, it REALLY WORKED.  Looks like I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> this product did not work for me, although it may work for others. . I used it on age/dark spots on face and hands, (undoubtedly the  result of sun damage from years ago) I used it 2X a day, for almost 2 months.  following the  directions carefully, I really hoped it would make a difference!!!!, but there was no change for me. However, the company was very responsive and I would happily do business with them again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work I used it as directed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 3 weeks ago and I&#x27;m still using it religiously, I have not seen any change or improvement.  I have two dark spots on my cheeks due to over exposure to the sun and they have not lightened at all.  This product has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it because I do not see any real changes!! And, i used it according to the instructions. Save your money!</li>
            <li> Not effective at all...</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s seems like it&#x27;s working. Been using it for 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> No results at all after a month</li>
            <li> Four stars...only because we have been using it for just a couple of weeks but the signs are very encouraging.  The dark spots on my husband&#x27;s face have decreased markedly and he intends to continue using it as per bottle directions.</li>
            <li> Master Pro 127 is in one of your product for dark foggy on Waze for the dark spots that are on my hands I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s going to do the work</li>
            <li> Since I have  been living in Hawaii for 30+ years of my life, I have some unwanted sun spots on my face. I have tried a dark spot corrector from a salon and it didn&#x27;t really work well. So when I was asked to try THE ONE, The Best Dark Spot Corrector for a great deal and share my honest opinion and thoughts, I agreed! As soon as it arrived, I read the directions and began that evening. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I can  see some fading! These horrible spots on my face are actually disappearing...fast! I recommend this product for anyone who wants to get rid of those irritating dark spots!</li>
            <li> I started using Dark Spot 3 weeks ago twice a day faithfully.  I was so excited to get this product home and getting results.  However, it has been just the opposite. I have not notice any lightning of the dark spots on my skin at all. There has been some lightning of spots that are not quite as dark.  (Even on those spots it&#x27;s barely noticeable. ) Prior to using Dark Spot I was using Clinique Dark Spot Removal.  I have seen significant results from this product and will continue to use it. Very disappointed in Dark Spot!</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day for 12 &amp; have seen no improvement.....would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 3 months and see NO change whatsoever. This product is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all!!!! 👎👎</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on this product. I don&#x27;t have a good sense how long it should normally take for a spot removal product to work so I&#x27;m continuing to use it as recommended to see if it has the results as advertised. I&#x27;ve had it now for about 4-5 weeks and I have noticed a small lightening of a few spots but whether it will substantially reduce he spots has yet to be seen.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star, only because I could not give it 0 otherwise I couldn&#x27;t send it. After using it twice a day as per directions little or anything changed, would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t notice major change and I been using it for about 3 weeks now. I&#x27;d say, if you have severe skin discoloration see a dermatologist instead. You&#x27;ll get better results, after all is your face. Take care of it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t meet My expectation.</li>
            <li> Worthless, used it for three weeks and son no improvement. Don&#x27;t bother with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The One for about a month.  Sadly, I have not had much lightening.  I have been using it on my face, neck and hands twice a day.  I had hoped I would see more results than I have in this time frame.  I will continue until I use up this bottle, then decide what to do if the results do not improve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for the last 3 weeks. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference, but I&#x27;m still hopeful.  I will continue to use it and hope that it lightens the spots on my face.</li>
            <li> No results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I tried a bottle of this product and noticed some results right away.  I am using it on my hands and face.  I was surprised that a red spot on my face that I have had for years faded, and some other dark spots have lightened.  Others have been more resistant but seem lighter.  Then other spots have not changed at all.  Overall, it is worth a shot, especially since the ingredients aren&#x27;t harmful.  I actually like the way it makes my face feel overall.  I do wish it came in a pump dispenser rather than a dropper, but I had a pump dispenser that I made fit the bottle so I am happy enough.  I will try another bottle.</li>
            <li> I been used this for 2 weeks and see the little result and it might take little longer on me and wait to see. I have finished the first bottom and going to buy the other bottom and I can see the result and improvement.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Saw results in a week.</li>
            <li> This product has significantly lightened some discoloration that I had on my face.  I will continue to use this, along with sunblock, to prevent further dark spots.  It also does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> for me,this product did not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not too sure yet but still trying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an Excellent product and my wife use with indication inside</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about one month and I do see lightening of a sun damaged area on my face.  i will continue 2 x day as prescribed.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on &#x27;liver spots&#x27; on my hand.  I have not seen any improvement, to date. I have applied it to the spots since October 6th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think, to be fair, I may  not have used the product long enough to give it a chance to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will use it for another month and then write another review</li>
            <li> The product is working as it should.  A little slower going that expected but a good product.</li>
            <li> Product does work as promised... However, you must protect the area with sun block, from sun exposure. Otherwise the dark areas return just as quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for a month now and see no results. I am not giving up yet.</li>
            <li> i think its the best thing i ever tried but i need to get more it cleard my face most of it really does work if you use it like it says to use.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 3 months ago, morning and night, every day.  I have some sun spots on my upper chest, back of hands and few on my temples (years of living in Florida).  There is a definite lighting of these brown spots since I started using this product.  Some spots have disappeared, others are more stubborn.  I have also noticed my skin tone has evened out.  I will continue to use the product to see if long term use makes any difference.  Overall, I am very pleased with the results.  Has it completely removed All my brown spots?  No.  Did it noticeably lighten them up and make some disappear?  Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other OTC brown spot treatments, like Clinique&#x27;s product and another one with hydroquinone, and neither worked as well as \\&quot;The One\\&quot;.  Of course everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so results will be different, but if you are looking for an effective brown spot treatment, give this a try.</li>
            <li> Used it for 30 days, no results. Smells like soap, bubbles up like soap, has soap ingredients. It&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me after 90 days use.</li>
            <li> The customer service was outstanding, delivery was ahead of schedule.  Good value, a little goes a long ways.  I&#x27;ve used the product for about 3 weeks and the results are noticeable.  The dark spots haven&#x27;t disappeared, but they&#x27;re definitely fading.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried a many of products and none can beat this. I am 59 and had been working outdoors sence I have been 18. With that many years working in the sun with no sun screen I ended up with major sun spots. The One has lightened it up more than 3/4 with the first bottle. I will be needing to buy another bottle to continue to make it lighter. I have tried many other products with just a little result. So, this is, by me the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 4 weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes</li>
            <li> The dark spots on my face have gotten lighter.  Looks good so far.</li>
            <li> Has worked to diminish some dark spots, the marks are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I honestly did not see a difference after three weeks of religiously applying this product twice a day!</li>
            <li> I have melasma, so I have light discoloration splotches all over my face. I tried another product that actually worked well but made my face red and oily for some reason. I&#x27;m thinking it is because it had hydroquinone. What I really like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t bother my super sensitive skin. There is no drying or peeling at all. I haven&#x27; used it for long but am starting to see some fading so that is great. I could spend $5,000 on a procedure at my plastic surgeons to only maybe make my melasma better or a reasonable amount with this product and get real results. I recommend that you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I did see any improvements so i mailed back product for refund.</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement whatsoever despite following the instructions on application twice daily.  Will not purchase again.  However, the company contacted me immediately and provided a full refund.</li>
            <li> Since starting to use this dark spot remover nearly twice a day in December, there has been no noticeable change. I&#x27;m continuing with hope of improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Don, from Anchorage</li>
            <li> All my life I have been ridden with dark circles under my eyes.  I&#x27;ll be honest, at first I was a skeptic.  That was until after the first few days had passed - there was a visible difference in the appearance of the circles that used to claim their space.  They were barely noticeable! I used to always hide my eyes behind sunglasses whenever possible, to avoid people saying &amp;#34;are you getting enough sleep&amp;#34; (yes), &amp;#34;are you getting enough vitamin(s)&amp;#34; (again, yes), and anything they could ask to try to diagnose my issue.  Even when my face was tan this would happen.  I am pleased with the results - and a little bit goes a LONG way so I am sure that this will last a nice long time.  So happy with this product! I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to fade any spots at all after 2 months of using it once every day.</li>
            <li> This product has been really great so far! I love the texture and smell.  I have been using it for about two weeks now and can already see a difference in the dark spots on my cheeks and chin!</li>
            <li> I used 4weeks not different my dark spot. But today I order one, I will try one more bottle. I will back feedback again.</li>
            <li> Okay I have been using for about a month. I have not noticed any changes. It does not seem to work for me. I have been applying it every morning and every night and there have been no changes.  3/3/15: Okay, I received this early January 2015 and have used it faithfully since I received it. I have not seen any improvement at all but I did give it a chance. It just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> The DArk Spot CORRECTOR does not work I used it for a month and it showed no improvement u still have the same dark spots no my legs wont buy again I want a refund.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all! It says satisfaction guaranteed if you are not happy within 367 days they will return it no questions asked, but there is only a 30 day return allowed and you don&#x27;t even know yet if it will work in that time. Do not buy! Not worth it! False advertising and bad product!</li>
            <li> I have used it twice daily for three weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen a difference!</li>
            <li> “The One” Dark Spot Corrector by Nature Science Labs is a skin brightener, and is designed to lighten age spots (liver spots).  It is made from natural ingredients and does not contain hydroquinone.  Using twice daily, put a drop or two on the brown spot and massage the product into the skin.  Now, apply your usual moisturizer or sunscreen.  That&#x27;s all there is to it.  I can see slight improvement on the brown spots on my hands in just one week&#x27;s time.  I&#x27;m hoping the spots completely fade away with repeated use.  I was provided this product in return for sharing my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> +I am using it on my legs.  I have multiple dark skin areas from injury and biopsy.  I heal very slowly and the Dark Spot has helped somewhat.  I have tried multiple other serums with no results so this has helped a little.</li>
            <li> I only have a couple of drops left and have not seen any difference on my hands. I used The One every day and night. I used sunscreen that was water proof. So, I don&#x27;t think I will order any more. Also, it would be good to let us know how long after&lt;br /&gt;applying The One, that we could apply a moisturizer. I waited a couple of minutes. The bottle didn&#x27;t let you judge when you are about to run out either.</li>
            <li> bought two bottles and have used most of it. may be a bit lighter but not sure. am 78 with 5 liver spots on face they are dark. your product may have lightened them about 1%.may try a bit longer butp.expect it will be more money down the drain&lt;br /&gt;also the dark bottle makes it impossible to see how much is being used. the dropper also is not very good.a clear bottle and a ceam would be better</li>
            <li> I get easily bitten by no seeums and mosquitoes and it leaves a dark spot on my legs and arms. I have been trying to find a miracle cream to make it go away. After a couple weeks of apply the cream I&#x27;ve seem some reduction of my dark spot. I will continue to use it to see if it fully removes the dark spot.</li>
            <li> Still in the review stage for my wife; it is a long process, and , slow going.</li>
            <li> I have a body that is full of freckles. Although I love my freckled body, there are some spots that are very dark, and or uneven looking. I found this product at an awesome discount, and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m happy to report, that the one spot I tested it on for the past week is showing a change in color. It is looking more like the other (lighter) freckles around the same spot. In my opinion the product is very easy to apply, with a dropper inside. The corrector lotion is very lightweight, dries rather quickly, and my favorite perk is it is in a dark blue bottle, which means it will last longer. I&#x27;m happy with this product I have reviewed.</li>
            <li> I have used the spot remover for the last 3 weeks. I started out using it daily, but thought that it may have been too much and began using it three times a week during my nightly skin routine. I have gotten acne scars as a result of having raised bumps on my face. I thought that this product would do the trick, but sadly, the dark marks are still there. I will continue to use this product until I have finished it, in hopes that it will begin to work.</li>
            <li> After one month of use, I have seen a definite reduction in the darkness of my spots, however, they are certainly not gone.  I have ordered another bottle and hope to see even better results with more time.  It has done a better job than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Hope springs eternal.</li>
            <li> REALLY GOOD Dark Spot Corrector~not perfect, though--but haven&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;found one that was.  Seller shipped QUICKLY and was A+ ALL THE WAY!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU Seller!</li>
            <li> i do not see any change in the dark spot on my face.  I have used it twice a day since it arrived , but alas.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked. I am very faired skinned and worshipped the Sun for far too long in my youth.  I had quite a few small spots all over my face. This product got rid of them. The darker, larger spots are taking longer but have noticeably gotten lighter. Works well on my chest and hands too. Wish it all worked with one bottle but I have ordered it a couple times now,,.so it is an ongoing treatment for me. But the future looks bright (pun intended)</li>
            <li> I use it two times daily and the spot&#x27;s became more dark</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days so that&#x27;s why I am only giving it 4 stars as I don&#x27;t know what the full results will be. I have acne scars from my teen years and I was super excited to get a complimentary bottle of this The One and share my honest and unbiased opinion with it here with you. With so many products out there claiming to do all the same things its hard to pick which one to use. I feel that The One makes it an easy choice with the perks of making this product with 98% of some of the highest quality natural ingredients, is made in an FDA regulated facility, has no parabens or sulfates and comes with a 100% product satisfaction guarantee! The size of this bottle is quite big, meaning this product will last you quite a while because you don&#x27;t use much of it. I have put this on various acne spots twice a day for a few days and like I said I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the spots but I can tell you that I have had no harsh side effects from this product, it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and it feels really good on your skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t live up to the claim for me.</li>
            <li> I finally get it delivered,I didnt get the first order that I placed,Yaye,I got this one,I love that it came on time.looking forward to the result.  If it does what it is supposed to do I will order it again.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Keep using for weeks but nothing changed, maybe it still need more time to work on my dark spot, will keep using anyway.</li>
            <li> I have serious dark spots on both of my cheeks. Have been using this products for 2 months now and my dark spots are fading slowly.</li>
            <li> This product ROCKS!!!!! I use to be so self conscious of some scars I had on my legs, but at this point I can barely see them .  Only one scar was really dark and that one is much lighter.  This was the best purchase I have made with fading cream. I purchased two and i will purchase two fade that last dark spot.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the spot corrector products that I have used. No, it does not work instantly, but the spots didn&#x27;t get there instantly either. I plan to continue using it since I am seeing good, steady results.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a month.  No change.  Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I purchased this based upon the reviews.  The bottle is half used and this product hasn&#x27;t touched my dark spots.  In fact, I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively with 50spf and my skin looks a wreck.  Small bumps under my skin forming pimples... And I cannot say this serum had done anything but lightly hydrate my skin.  Morning and night application to fresh skin, sunscreen and visors during the day.  Disappointed</li>
            <li> Not seeing any change yet. Bottle almost finished</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked about all the great reviews.  I have Ben using it for two weeks and don&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
            <li> The product is advertised as: \\&quot;The Best Dark Spot Corrector.  ...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been \\&quot;Best\\&quot; for me, as I can readily observe the product working since I began using it approximately&lt;br /&gt;4 weeks ago on brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of full disclosure I&#x27;ve been sent an email with a discount coupon by the seller which I expect to use;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW from a compete stranger, I wouldn&#x27;t use the coupon or purchase the item a second time&lt;br /&gt;unless the item was worth using.</li>
            <li> I used it for a while and I believe with long term use, it will help clear up the spots&lt;br /&gt;on my face. This product is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When they named this product\\&quot; The Best Dark Spot Corrector\\&quot; they were right on! It works, that all that needs to be said.....I&#x27;m 62 &amp; have had a few dark spots on my face for years from sun damage. I have tried so many products &amp; this is the ONLY one that actually worked. I use it once a day, at night and saw a difference in about 2 weeks. The spots aren&#x27;t totally gone but I would say they have faded about 70% - 75%. It is worth the money &amp; lasts a very long time, you don&#x27;t need to use much. I&#x27;ll keep using for years to come. Totally Awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product in the hopes that it would lighten some dark spots and on the dark circles around my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using it applied thinly to my clean face. There is a big difference. The spots have lightened so much in just a short time! The texture of this product nice. It&#x27;s not greasy or drying to the skin. It rubs in nicely. I am happy to have recieved this product to review. I will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li> I am in my late fifties and age spots started to show up on my hands - big, dark brown spots - and I hated them.  I bought this based on the reviews here, but was still a bit sceptical.  Well, after about 30 days of using this lotion my age spots have almost entirely disappeared!  The lotion goes on smoothly and dries virtually immediately.  I hope I don&#x27;t get a whole lot more age spots because it could get expensive - but I would spend the money on this stuff anyway.  It really is that good.</li>
            <li> Cannot comment on dark spot correction feature yet, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference! But it makes your asking very smooth! Nice feeling in your face.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t worked to mr</li>
            <li> I had a dark spot around my chest area, and it seems to be diminishing. Looking forward to seeing results on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff did not do a thing to reduce or eliminate the dark spots on my face and hands. I followed the directions specifically and applied the product twice a day until it ran out. Nothing happened. There were some good reviews and that is why I bought it and it is not cheap. Do not waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I like it:  I bought it for age spots and thinking that the kakadu plum was the premiere ingredient (I didn&#x27;t see it on the label- what is the technical name?).  In any case I will purchase more because by skin likes it.  I&#x27;m simply using this and C serum as my moisturizer and at 66 this combination gives me a youthful glow without make-up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference, wasted money</li>
            <li> I have not Seen any great imorovement,maybe dark spots a little lighter but not what I was hoping for, I use this product morning and evening .</li>
