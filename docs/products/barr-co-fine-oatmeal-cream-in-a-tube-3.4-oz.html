            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting to try this cream for a while now, as only a couple of products work for my hands in the winter time. When it arrived, the box was slightly damaged, and some product leaked out of the rolled end of the tube. Amazon was great about resolving the issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a shot anyway, and it did seem to work pretty well, but it was a little greasy and I really disliked the scent. It&#x27;s not obnoxious or overpowering, just not my cup of tea. I&#x27;ll stick with my slightly more expensive l&#x27;occitane shea butter hand cream in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells divine and very emollient. The scent is light and clean, slightly tropical.</li>
            <li> I discovered this hand lotion when I bought it at Anthropologie, and I intended it to be a guest item in my second bathroom.  The scent is so pleasantly sweet and fresh, and the lotion is so rich and creamy, I had to get another one for myself.  Thanks, Amazon!  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream EVER!</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite hand cream; its not greasy and the scent is very nice and not flowery.</li>
            <li> EASILY the greasiest lotion that I have ever used. I washed my hands 5 time in an effort to remove it, but I was still leaving smudges and greasy fingerprints on everything. It smells great, but it&#x27;s similar to what I would expect if I used vegetable shortening on my hands. It may work for you, but it&#x27;s an expensive chance to take.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!!!! Beautifully designed packaging and amazing product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself, but shared it with my teenage son who has trouble with eczema. It has helped him more than any other product or medication that we have tried recently. He doesn&#x27;t mind the scent either.</li>
            <li> Lovely. I can&#x27;t think of a better word to describe Barr Co. Fine Oatmel Cream. I love the rich, thick texture of the cream and I adore the scent which lingers. It&#x27;s...lovely!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, angry skin (sometimes) that doesn&#x27;t really like lotions and creams with harsh dyes and perfumes.

Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t stick to your jeans or pants, and is generally awesome.</li>
            <li> Non greasy. Great lotion!!  A friend of mine uses this....I wish it was sold in stores. Thankfully it&#x27;s easy to order!  Also I love that the fragrance level is low....nothing perfumey at all.</li>
            <li> Every winter my hands get so dry that when I use ordinary hand lotion they burn and turn red.  A friend of mine had some of this and I tried it one time and ordered some from Amazon the very same day.  That one time made the biggest difference I have even seen on my hands.  I love the soft smell.  If you have dry hands and have been looking for something that will make a BIG difference, this is the hand cream for you.  I have one in my purse, on my desk at work, in my kitchen, and in my bedroom.  I will not be without it ever again.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that seems to help my dry, flaky hands. My fingers get so dry the skin splits around my nails, and this stuff really helps.</li>

            <li> My fav. hand cream. I get so many compliments when I use it.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Clean and simple scent. Very moisturizing. It&#x27;s also a very cute container. I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love!!! This stuff is amazing  it absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I can&#x27;t live without it. I keep a tube in my purse a tube at work. The smell is Ali great. I always get compliments in it</li>
            <li> Perfect amount of emulsion and an aroma that is pure and appealing. Guaranteed to evoke compliments.</li>
