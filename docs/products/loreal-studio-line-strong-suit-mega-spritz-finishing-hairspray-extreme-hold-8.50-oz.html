            <li>It&#x27;s got a great hold and a low price, making the styling of fine hair easy.</li>
            <li>For it&#x27;s cheap price</li>
            <li>I was so excited, and I read the reviews, but still bought product.  </li>
            <li>A great product for extremely humid climate.</li>
            <li>As advertised and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Works great and seems to be less toxic than aerosol hair spray.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>but I do like the non-aerosol spray and find it useful both as a setting lotion and finishing spray.  </li>
            <li>This product is great , it holds your hair in  place without being stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>Does not dull my hair and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>They contend that they sent me the right product, and I disagree.</li>
            <li>Love this hair spray makes my hair look shiny not dull and really holds.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair which I wear short</li>
            <li>Also lightweight enough for fine or thinning hair!</li>
            <li>Maybe people LIKE to pay MORE for the same thing?  </li>
            <li>Somewhat hard to find in stores, so it&#x27;s nice to have it easy to find and order.</li>
            <li>Overall I would say it is satisfactory, and I will certainly continue using it until I discover something which works better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to most products but can use this one with no trouble.</li>
            <li>It keeps my 80&#x27;s big curling iron hair perfect everyday all day!!  </li>
            <li>I am wondering if it just got in a hot humid area when transported as it was really sticky in the area where it is supposed to spritz out</li>
            <li>I have been using this hair spray for over 20 years, and it does very well in keeping my hair in place, even in windy weather.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I really hope Loreal doesn&#x27;t discontinue or change the formula.</li>
            <li>Great spray holds firm and washes out clean no lingering heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li>This product is so much better the other spritzes or spray as it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like a concrete block.</li>
            <li>Better value than local big box stores.</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t let me down! :)</li>
            <li>Soft scent very pleasing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Mega Spritz for the at least 10 years and nothing else gives my hair this kind of body.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many, many years--so does my husband &amp; I was so sorry to see it disappearing off the shelves being replaced by newer looking Loeal Hair Products!  </li>
            <li>I love the way it holds without my hair feeling hard.</li>
            <li>I believe it has been around since the 1980&#x27;s or 1990&#x27;s and is becoming harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>and I have had to continuously run hot water through the nozzle and valve that goes down into the bottle.</li>
            <li>This works great for keeping my bangs slightly off  my face and keeping some fullness in my thin hair after I blow dry it in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, floppy hair, and this product gives my hair volume.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it never disappoints. I have very fine hair which I wear short and this will hold it in shape all day no matter what the weather.  Does not dull my hair and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> my favourite hair spray.  I cant get it anymore in a store</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and bought it recently from Amazon.  This works great for keeping my bangs slightly off  my face and keeping some fullness in my thin hair after I blow dry it in the morning.  It does not make my hair feel heavy or weigh it down.  As I mentioned, I have been using it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Another item I can&#x27;t always find in local stores.  I use it every day and love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It has been harder and harder to find. I have been using all different kinds of products, but nothing comes close to this product.  Finally went on line to see if I could buy it.  I was so excited, and I read the reviews, but still bought product.  Not the same product that I have been using.  Very disappointing. Will keep on trying different products to find one that I like.</li>
            <li> This is not a perfect product for my hair type (fine and limp) but I do like the non-aerosol spray and find it useful both as a setting lotion and finishing spray.  The spray valve tends to clog often.  Overall I would say it is satisfactory, and I will certainly continue using it until I discover something which works better.</li>
            <li> pleased with item thank you</li>
            <li> Great price for my favorite hair spray! I bought several so I don&#x27;t run out! My local stores have all discontinued it for some reason. Great spray holds firm and washes out clean no lingering heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray makes my hair look shiny not dull and really holds.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair spray for over 10 years and L&#x27;Oreal decided to discontinue it.  So I could not find it on shelves.  I found it on Amazon and purchased about 10 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;After I got it home and used it, as I did in the past - i noticed it did not smell the same or hold my hair in the same way.  So I don&#x27;t think it is what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I love the way it holds without my hair feeling hard.</li>
            <li> Love!  Use this with my fine hair that doesn&#x27;t want stay where I put it, this is great!  It is a stiff hold. Have used it for years!!</li>
            <li> Somewhat hard to find in stores, so it&#x27;s nice to have it easy to find and order. L&#x27;Oreal has been our go-to brand of hair spray for years.</li>
            <li> As advertised and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves this product. Great hold without the crunch.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, floppy hair, and this product gives my hair volume.  Also, I can style my hair while the spray is still wet.  For the most part, it holds my hair in place without giving me the &amp;#34;helmet look&amp;#34; of hairspray.</li>

            <li> I been using this product for years!  Love it!</li>
            <li> since I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores, I ordered it from here.  This product is so much better the other spritzes or spray as it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like a concrete block.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or greasy and actually adds some shine.  Good price , nice product.</li>
            <li> Works rather well, I don&#x27;t need too much for a firm hold.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way. Makes my flat top stand up perfect!</li>
            <li> Better value than local big box stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to most products but can use this one with no trouble. Have used it for years! Works very well.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for I think over 20 years.  Can&#x27;t do without it.  Works great and seems to be less toxic than aerosol hair spray.</li>
            <li> I use this on wet hair and brush through when dry. It helps to add style and give a little body and fullness to my hair.</li>
            <li> The only hairspray I like.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many, many years--so does my husband &amp; I was so sorry to see it disappearing off the shelves being replaced by newer looking Loeal Hair Products!  It keeps my 80&#x27;s big curling iron hair perfect everyday all day!!  Amazon please keep it in stock once it&#x27;s gone from store shelves for good!  It keeps your hair perfectly intact &amp; shiny!! Please don&#x27;t let me down! :)</li>
            <li> A great product for extremely humid climate. Also lightweight enough for fine or thinning hair! I cannot find it in stores any more!</li>
            <li> This product is great , it holds your hair in  place without being stiff or sticky. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s cheap price it&#x27;s an effective product.&lt;br /&gt;I also own the Mega Hair Gel and the Melting Gel Strong Hold (6.8 oz both).&lt;br /&gt;I have very wavy thick but dry hair. This spray is very strong and holds the hair in place well but it does of course leave the hair quite crispy.</li>
            <li> Great hair care product.  Cannot always find in the store and this is priced less.</li>
            <li> OCTMASTER had on their website a picture of a pump hair spray which I&#x27;ve always used. When I ordered it, that&#x27;s what I expected to receive from the seller. What I got instead were 3 aerisole cans and the seller refused to refund the postage of $10 to return it. They contend that they sent me the right product, and I disagree. It was the right product, in the wrong container. Aerisole containers are more dangerous to people with lung problems than pump sprays. Therefore, I feel I got ripped off with the excessive postage I had to pay. They shouldn&#x27;t place a picture of a product they don&#x27;t have. They should have posted the aerisole cans instead.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray!  I have used it for over 25 years and it is getting hard to find.  Maybe people LIKE to pay MORE for the same thing?  I don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Only place my wife can find this product. She says there is no substitute.</li>
            <li> I really hope Loreal doesn&#x27;t discontinue or change the formula. It&#x27;s my go-to hair spray for styling. Keeps my hair in place and lasts and lasts. The best part is no buildup or flakes. One of the best pump hair sprays on the market!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or heavy.  Brushes out and softens up if that&#x27;s what you need to do.  But holds hair in place without making it look and feel plastered.</li>
            <li> The spritz did not spray or spritz out like others I have bought in the stores over the years. I am wondering if it just got in a hot humid area when transported as it was really sticky in the area where it is supposed to spritz out and I have had to continuously run hot water through the nozzle and valve that goes down into the bottle. Once I do that it works ok but not like it should.</li>
            <li> mega spritz is the most awesome product. Gives direct and selective control for styling due to spritz effect verses aerosol. The shape of the bottle is a perfect fit to your hand for ease of application. Soft scent very pleasing. This product is perfection at its best! Please never discontinue. Your faithful consumer,Paula.</li>
            <li> Awesome hold, I have used it for years and am never disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mega Spritz for the at least 10 years and nothing else gives my hair this kind of body.</li>
            <li> This is a great, staple hairspray.  I believe it has been around since the 1980&#x27;s or 1990&#x27;s and is becoming harder and harder to find. in the sea of increasing numbers of hair products. This hairspray has a firm hold that stays all day, even in humid conditions.  Non-aerosol.  Can be used on wet or dry hair.  A classic.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer care taken with everything.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Line Mega Spritz for years.  It&#x27;s got a great hold and a low price, making the styling of fine hair easy.</li>
