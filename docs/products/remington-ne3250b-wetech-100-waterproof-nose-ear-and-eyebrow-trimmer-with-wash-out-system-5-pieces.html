            <li>I would consider it a great buy at 15 bucks or so.</li>
            <li>Its got a great pointy trimmer tip</li>
            <li>For the price, the Remington NE3250 Nose, Ear, and Brow Trimmer is a great product, but the Brow Attachment Head/Blade seems to stop the device from working after each use.  </li>

            <li>It worked out great with some hair problems here and there.</li>
            <li>but it would have been great with batteries included.</li>
            <li>great product for the price</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Worked great for about 9 months, then just stopped working.</li>
            <li>One word, Cheaply made.!!!</li>
            <li>very nice product.</li>
            <li>Okay but not the greatest product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof, the blade thingies don&#x27;t pull or prick, it has a couple of attachments, and it&#x27;s surprisingly well built.  </li>
            <li>It works as advertised and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good job, Remington.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really a good trimmer, I just wish it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li>The Good:  Gets close without razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quality</li>
            <li>Remington is a good name</li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>The Remington Products NE3250 Nose, Ear and Brow Trimmer looked like a good candidate, so I accepted</li>
            <li>Good design and appearance, wished it would of lasted...</li>
            <li>a good tool to remove them.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>For the price I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent, easy to use and safe.  </li>
            <li>Excellent Item and Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product it works exactly as it is advertised</li>
            <li>Trimmer trims nicely... when it works.  </li>
            <li>Good power and glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Nice design for the jobs it&#x27;s designed to handle.</li>
            <li>Nice grip and heft&lt;</li>
            <li>I think this is better for men than woman, if you want it to remove nose hairs for a man, I suppose its good, for anything else, I don&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice for nose trimming</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally this a battery operated tool and not the kind that you recharge</li>
            <li>It seems like a nice design -- nice weight and shape.</li>
            <li>and I liked that a lot,</li>
            <li>For example, I tried to turn it on after putting lotion on my arms and it took a fair bit more effort.  </li>
            <li>Good quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a rubberized body and good feel and controls operate smoothly.  </li>
            <li>great product and trimming is easy and precise.</li>
            <li>Works great, eyebrow comb is just the right length.</li>
            <li>Separate switch is better.</li>
            <li>Better than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>It does better than scissors or the rotating blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda satisfy :-)</li>
            <li>Remington is supposed to have a better reputation.</li>
            <li>I love this trimer</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was even working because I couldn&#x27;t hear the snipping and, thankfully, I didn&#x27;t feel any tugging.  </li>
            <li>One blade with more power to it would be better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The length of hair that it leaves is appropriate for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It still works, just the top part is bent backwards some.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better options out</li>
            <li>Great value, I really like the mustache/brow comb.</li>
            <li>One thing it didn&#x27;t come with is batteries, so make sure you get those too.</li>
            <li>After some intense research I decided to purchase this item which Amazon happens to offer at a great price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this item.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it had light built in.</li>
            <li>so I am well acquainted with these men&#x27;s trimmers....</li>
            <li>I SURE as heck won&#x27;t pay for one after all this to find out, not even at this price.</li>
            <li>This one has two blades, situated at angles on the top.</li>
            <li>and I like this one a bit better</li>
            <li>I found that the rotary head works okay for the nose hair, but not for ear hair.</li>
            <li>There is an eyebrow addition which seems okay.</li>
            <li>What I mostly wanted this product for was for the brow trimmer aspect of it.</li>
            <li>Both heads cut well and appear to be designed so that one does not seem to be able to cut oneself</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this product and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have this trimmer.</li>
            <li>We received the  \\&quot;Remington Products NE3250 Nose, Ear and Brow Trimmer\\&quot; via the Vine Program to evaluate, and we found that, while it will get the job done, its functionality and design are just &#x27;OK.&#x27;</li>
            <li>One of the better ones we&#x27;ve used was a Panasonic kit that consisted of a separate pocket-sized nose trimmer and a single-bladed trimmer (which also worked well for bikini trimming)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, an ok product that just means one more gadget in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>There are many better options out there for woman.</li>
            <li>Would have given 5 if the trimmer had more than just one length</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this</li>
            <li>can trim your nose and ears up a bit after getting this, mostly nose.</li>
            <li>Yes? :-)</li>
            <li>He loves this product and says it works better than any he&#x27;s tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it recharge able</li>
            <li>I guess i&#x27;ll resort to the Panasonic trimmer that i hung on to because it had a better set of &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; attachments for beards etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trimming, not pulling:  The trimmer got nice clean cuts for hairs that stick out.  </li>
            <li>works great, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and very precise</li>
            <li>However, was able to easily return and receive a refund without delay.</li>
            <li>I can not recommend when I know there are better options available.</li>
            <li>Glad it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Love it useful thank you !</li>
            <li>Its not bad!  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;returned easily</li>
            <li>OK but not as good as my old item which just started to work again.</li>
            <li>Easily recommended for its sturdy build and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Easily maintains the stache.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has a loop in the handle so you can hang it in the bathroom for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coolest thing about this system</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know why everything breaks so easily.  </li>
            <li>The attachments for ear and nose trimming were easy to attach and remove.  </li>
            <li>The attachments and head are also easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is battery-powered rather than rechargeable, which is why I&#x27;m taking one star off, but otherwise this two-blade trimmer gets the job done neat and easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Breaks easily, but it is reliable</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t clogged and rinses easy.</li>
            <li>I also like the easy washout feature that allows me to rinse it in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First trimmer that arrived didn&#x27;t work, Amazon was nice enought to replace it.</li>
            <li>The trimmer work fine .</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the trimmer seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I like the eyebrow attachment a lot because its got fine combs on each side</li>
            <li>It has been working fine</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>When it doesn&#x27;t die it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>When they work they work fine</li>
            <li>This trimmer doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the hair and seems to cut it just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and a pleasure to use...</li>
            <li>The comb fits securely.</li>
            <li>So since it was cheap I just ordered another one.</li>
            <li>I thought i would give it another shot and picked one up at a local store, worked great for about a month</li>
            <li>Light trimmer.</li>
            <li>Great buy especially for the money.</li>
            <li>honestly, I can&#x27;t tell, because Neither ear, nor over-flowing nose hair seem too much of a nuisance for me.</li>
            <li>I recommended  the material isn&#x27;t too cheap and turning it on</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Light and compact and portable.</li>
            <li>I also experienced several cuts from the trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li>Kinda cheap quality</li>
            <li>just feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Turns out that the blades were stuck and required a water rinse to free them.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>In that short time the trimmer had become very warm to the touch even though the motor continued to not work.</li>
            <li>I liked that it had decent power when it was working</li>
            <li>The heads are easily exchangable, overall a good product.</li>
            <li>A better option for most would be to find a beard groomer that has different attachments and can do what this product does, and more.</li>
            <li>they recommend NOT using rechargeable batteries, saying it wil impair the function of the device (we tried both, and did not notice any real difference, but we assume they printed the warning for a valid reason!); thus, more battery cost and waste&lt;</li>
            <li>Original review  </li>
            <li>I use them to shorten the length and clean up the arch.  </li>
            <li>There is only one bright light here that the nose hair trimmer it worked well.</li>
            <li>Use it mainly for eye brows between haircuts, perfect every time, Just snap on eyebrow comb, one swipe left and one swipe right done.</li>
            <li>The nose trimmer and eyebrow trimmer attachments are easily interchangeable and the unit as a whole is easy to wash by just running water over it.</li>
            <li>Cheap precision micro edge is seen on TV , worked better , gave more control, and the eyebrow guides actually helped.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this trimmer represents good value.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer really helps wrangle in my eye brow hairs and makes them look more presentable.</li>
            <li>, to summarize, while we feel this product would likely serve the needs of most consumers, we also feel that there are better options available.</li>
            <li>Works fairly well, but only lasted about 6 uses before it stopped powering on.</li>
            <li>Good for nose but don&#x27;t plan o use it on eyebrows, it doesn&#x27;t get a close enough shave!</li>
            <li>The only good thing is I got it quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof, easy to hold and operate, and does exactly what you expect.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works adequately as advertised.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so cheaply made, it never felt like the bottom &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; was ever securely in place, and the contacts would no longer align no matter how much I fiddled with it.</li>
            <li>However, Amazon was quick to refund my money.</li>
            <li>(the linear head is the one shown in the main picture of this product).&lt;br /&gt;The linear head works well for the ear, and the rotary head works better for the nose (although I still end up using a scissors once in a while).</li>
            <li>It is quick and painless.  </li>
            <li>My hair grows quickly</li>
            <li>I took good care of it too and kept it clean and dry.</li>
            <li>I love these little personal shavers because they are so easy to use and work great on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>For the price this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Great little product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little tool for getting unwanted body hair out of the way.  </li>
            <li>Great little battery-powered nose-hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer and it worked great for a few weeks (5-6)  </li>
            <li>I really like the Remington MPT3800SSB Smooth and Silky Precision Trimmer.</li>
            <li>I would still consider it a really awesome trimmer with the exception if it being easily broken</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found a product my husband can use on his own without complaints.  </li>
            <li>not something I find useful.  </li>
            <li>and I am not cutting off anything I don&#x27;t want to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, but I took away a star because it does not have the same &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; attachment as my old Remington.  </li>
            <li>pool quality,not worth it</li>
            <li>Then never turned on again, even with a fresh battery.</li>
            <li>Gets hot when turned on and does not cut quickly.</li>
            <li>is that it&#x27;s easy to rinse and if you need a deep clean, it has a really cool wash out system that flushes out all the nooks and</li>
            <li>Not the sellers fault, they did everything right.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>This is the right product for us hairy guys.  </li>
            <li>is the right additional part to ensure a continuous, even cut.</li>
            <li>Now it barely turns on and it didn&#x27;t even do that great of a job when it was actually working.</li>
            <li>As I turned it on, the noise level seemed relatively quiet, the trimmer fit my hand well, and was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer started off strong with a rubber grommet to seal out corrosion from moister on the motors; the downfall of many other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Easily frees my nose of pesky hair with the dual action blades.</li>
            <li>they lifts the hair right into the blade making trimming super easy and again let times to have to swipe back and forth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, otherwise, it&#x27;s a good little</li>
            <li>The build does feel a little cheap -- the plastic seems flimsy -- but for the price it is suitable.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was within the 30 return window and Amazon sent a new one right away.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Tried 4 different tested and working batteries just to be sure.  </li>
            <li>Freezes up and has to be helped to move after the first use and every use afterwards?</li>
            <li>The first time, it did not work after 3 weeks and the return policy was no longer valid.</li>
            <li>It broke the first day he used it.</li>
            <li>I made sure to change batteries several times, but the electric motor would not operate.  </li>
            <li>Worked OK for several months then just quit.</li>
            <li>Will pay more for something that actually works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pulled the battery, the end of the battery that came in contact with the motor has become quite hot.</li>
            <li>Died, ceased operating before first battery was used up.  </li>
            <li>But I can be sure it won&#x27;t short circuit from accidentally getting splashed in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic rechargeable similar unit for years which has more trimmer heads</li>
            <li>First one lasted six weeks.  </li>
            <li>I am either dealing with a defective device or the entire world has lost it&#x27;s mind:-)  </li>
            <li>It was pretty intuitive.  </li>
            <li>This attachment seems to work better, but overall, I cannot recommend this from my experience.</li>
            <li>Really nice trimmer, especially for ear and nose hair (don&#x27;t really have too much brow to be trimmed).</li>
            <li>One trick I learned from another reviewer is to push the eye brow hairs up, cover the parts you don&#x27;t want cut and only cut the top portion.</li>
            <li>Broke first day on the job.</li>
            <li>Hope it lasts longer than the first one...</li>
            <li>wish the on/off function was a bit more obvious and an easier &amp;#34;click&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; to use, but you have to be pretty deliberate about it.  </li>
            <li>i got this trimmer for my father and I got to see him couple of months after receiving it, unfortunately it never worked.</li>
            <li>The first time it worked.  </li>
            <li>waste of money does not work good</li>
            <li>This trimmer works fairly well but it has a few problems.  </li>
            <li>ie, if you have no other options...since we have had much better experience with other makes/models; here are our findings in more detail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As expected, so far so good.</li>
            <li>It has nice sharp blades that really trim the hairs pretty much on the first swipe.</li>
            <li>Given the number of positive reviews (albeit ALL Vine it seems?)</li>
            <li>the swapping of the blades, the battery installation and the on/off function are all somewhat unobvious; they could be marked better and have more of a solid &#x27;click&#x27; when the proper twist position is achieved&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and seems well-built compared to similar devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it can be rinsed in water and hung up to dry.  </li>
            <li>I have used these kinds of trimmers before and most have a single blade and work well.</li>
            <li>but is a tad large in terms of diameter.  </li>
            <li>I recommend use under supervision, or at least be sure the user knows there are guards to prevent full on defoliation!</li>
            <li>But I expected more than one use out of it.</li>
            <li>Just what wanted Thanks</li>
            <li>But with this Remington trimmer he says he doesn&#x27;t feel anything, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>The nose hair trimmer works very well and the eyebrow trimmer does too.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li>I will carry this unit during travel because it&#x27;s very travel</li>
            <li>so I have to wait much longer than I should.</li>
            <li>treat my stuff gently</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li>cleans my hairy nostrils up really</li>
            <li>He is very hairy, including lots of hair growing inside his ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet</li>
            <li>These did not work very well for me at all.</li>
            <li>&gt;▲ Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it had was a light.  </li>
            <li>A gentle reminder...</li>
            <li>Worked great dropped it once broken</li>
            <li>Cheap chinese junk!!</li>
            <li>It’s simple to use, works better than the old one we had</li>
            <li>trimmer is small, light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>eyebrow combs make sure you don&#x27;t shave off your eyebrows accidently and creates a smooth look though only if you have some seriously wild and long hairs up there.  </li>
            <li>(okay, my nose) than the dedicated rotary blade that both it and my other trimmer have.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor and the two cutters are effective and don&#x27;t stall or snag like in my previous Remington MPT-3500B, which had a hard time even starting against its own</li>
            <li>Way better than my previous one.</li>
            <li>I cannot find a decent brand that is reliable.  </li>
            <li>I also have a Panasonic and older Wahl.</li>
            <li>it could use a storage pouch or travel box, since it consists of the main body, 2 separate heads and a brow</li>
            <li>although the main body has a lanyard loop, none is included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is much bigger than similar products but performs that much better.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare its functionality to other models, but I can say as a newbie to these devices that this was easy to use.</li>
            <li>There are two separate heads that are easy to change: one for the eyebrows and ear lobe, the other for nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to turn on and off.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to try it on my eyebrows, even though they are not thick, either.</li>
            <li>It was used for months before a counter level drup broke the product, so handle with care as the plastic is brittle, but overall worth the money.</li>
            <li>It simply croaked, tried fresh batteries, cleaning it, etc.</li>
            <li>but when I finally bought fresh AA batteries and tried it, I realized I bought a lemon.</li>
            <li>Better built that others, but I would still like to see a version of this that one could expect to last a long time.  </li>
            <li>No complaint in 1year.</li>
            <li>It does a good job on ears and nose, although my husband finds the vibration irritating in the nose area.  </li>
            <li>Worked great the first time I used it, sadly that was also the last time it worked.</li>
            <li>For as often as I use it I&#x27;ll live with it.</li>
            <li>It worked for a month and then stopped working even with a new battery.</li>
            <li>double blades give you a smooth, quiet shave that catches all hair.</li>
            <li>Overall i wish my wife had save whatever pittance she paid for this and spent it on coffee - it would have been a better investment.  </li>
            <li>power is OK, but the angle of the top is not good for woman, if you want to get an extra hair on your chin or above your lip or eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would not recommend to a woman is using it all over your face as some kind of catch all clean up because it can make your face feel bristly after a few days while the short hairs grow back out.</li>
            <li>Finally a nose hair trimmer that really works up there in the caverns!</li>
            <li>Cheap product not worth the price</li>
            <li>Like with all products one should read the directions first to learn how the battery is properly inserted and how the two heads function.</li>
            <li>I should have bought this one in the first place, rather than the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;The unit as pictured is with the eyebrow trimmer attached, the nose/ear hair attachment is the standard rounded tip.&lt;br /&gt;There are no problems with snagging or &amp;#34;nipping&amp;#34; and the eyebrow attachment is an added bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get my nasal passage all rubbed raw feeling either, worked very well and was comfortable to the touch.</li>
            <li>This little trimmer is easy to handle and meets all of my expectations.  </li>
            <li>so I have to put this a little farther in my nose than makes me feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>- it feels a little sturdier and seems a little more powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s double sided which is weird to get used to, but great.</li>
            <li>It provides a close cut and the clear plastic trimmer (not included in the picture)</li>
            <li>I wish they would let me buy just the clear plastic eyebrow attachment, but it does work well</li>
            <li>Will not waste my money on this brand again.</li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift, and so far, no complaints from them</li>
            <li>In ALL those years, this is only the 2Nd item I ever bought OR tried for free on the Vine Program that simply does not work.</li>
            <li>It does what it says it should efficiently and, thus far, without any problems.</li>
            <li>Kind of irritating when it comes without them</li>
            <li>only works well on noses and ears,but unlike other trimmers I have used, also works well on fine hairs.</li>
            <li>And the rotary head works fine on both--it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s an option on the Remington and the only choice on the other.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get excited about a $12 trimmer, but these guys have really knocked one out of the park on this one.  </li>
            <li>and it never really worked right.</li>
            <li>so it was easy to manipulate and use making this a much better choice than tiny scissors (and not as dangerous aside from the problem</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but as a man, I wish it were a little more substantial and larger, it is just a bit too small as far as the trimmer goes.  </li>
            <li>I AM ALPHA MALE video blogs, and was looking for new trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Tried several new batteries to no avail.  </li>
            <li>trimmer is a decent size for a guys hand, not to thin so you can hold it easily.</li>
            <li>works well, but a little more lite duty than expected!</li>
            <li>My husband was excited to start a little Man-grooming, but he got over zealous, and now he&#x27;s waiting for the rest of his eyebrows to grow back...</li>
            <li>the ear/brow trimmer has a 2-blade design which doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as the single blade units we&#x27;ve used in the past; it works, but no where near as well as the single design&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes qwith many trim heads for those tough to get at areas.</li>
            <li>There is also an eyebrow comb with the package which helps to keep eyebrows aligned in the same direction and avoid wild looking eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I have an old one i have from way back on those tv commercials</li>
            <li>but after a few weeks of light use it would not work only intermittently and finally it will not work at all.  </li>
            <li>if not careful you&#x27;ll end up opening the battery compartment rather than turning on the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the top part was easily broken.</li>
            <li>It can be used wet or dry and is very gentle--no hair pulling or skin pinching!</li>
            <li>The other trimmer I reviewed &amp;#34;Remington Dual Blade Detail Trimmer Eyebrows Nose Ear Sideburns MPT-3400C&amp;#34; despite its issue with rust, was a better model since at least it didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>Had it for a few weeks before first use, thus missed the return date window.</li>
            <li>Certainly didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected.  </li>
            <li>thing I especially like about this particular trimmer is that, unlike my other trimmer, it has a choice of blades.</li>
            <li>This thing is the SHIZZLE, except your gotta take care on sensitive areas, as it does &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; loose skin.</li>
            <li>and I really like the fact that it can be used wet and or dry.</li>
            <li>Its also wet dry capable</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A rechargeable battery would&#x27;ve been an excellent addition.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s customer service is excellent and must know it&#x27;s a problem.</li>

            <li> Great quality and battery life.</li>
            <li> I would consider it a great buy at 15 bucks or so.</li>
            <li> Its got a great pointy trimmer tip</li>
            <li> For the price, the Remington NE3250 Nose, Ear, and Brow Trimmer is a great product, but the Brow Attachment Head/Blade seems to stop the device from working after each use.  </li>
            <li> Great grooming tool for travel.</li>

            <li> It worked out great with some hair problems here and there.</li>
            <li> but it would have been great with batteries included.</li>
            <li> great product for the price</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 9 months, then just stopped working.</li>
            <li> One word, Cheaply made.!!!</li>
            <li> very nice product.</li>
            <li> Okay but not the greatest product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof, the blade thingies don&#x27;t pull or prick, it has a couple of attachments, and it&#x27;s surprisingly well built.  </li>
            <li> It works as advertised and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good job, Remington.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really a good trimmer, I just wish it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li> The Good:  Gets close without razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good quality</li>
            <li> Remington is a good name</li>
            <li> and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Remington Products NE3250 Nose, Ear and Brow Trimmer looked like a good candidate, so I accepted</li>
            <li> Good design and appearance, wished it would of lasted...</li>
            <li> a good tool to remove them.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> For the price I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent, easy to use and safe.  </li>
            <li> Excellent Item and Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product it works exactly as it is advertised</li>
            <li> Trimmer trims nicely... when it works.  </li>
            <li> Good power and glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Nice design for the jobs it&#x27;s designed to handle.</li>
            <li> Nice grip and heft&lt;</li>
            <li> I think this is better for men than woman, if you want it to remove nose hairs for a man, I suppose its good, for anything else, I don&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice for nose trimming</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally this a battery operated tool and not the kind that you recharge</li>
            <li> It seems like a nice design -- nice weight and shape.</li>
            <li> and I liked that a lot,</li>
            <li> For example, I tried to turn it on after putting lotion on my arms and it took a fair bit more effort.  </li>
            <li> Good quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a rubberized body and good feel and controls operate smoothly.  </li>
            <li> great product and trimming is easy and precise.</li>
            <li> Works great, eyebrow comb is just the right length.</li>
            <li> Separate switch is better.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> It does better than scissors or the rotating blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda satisfy :-)</li>
            <li> Remington is supposed to have a better reputation.</li>
            <li> I love this trimer</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it was even working because I couldn&#x27;t hear the snipping and, thankfully, I didn&#x27;t feel any tugging.  </li>
            <li> One blade with more power to it would be better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The length of hair that it leaves is appropriate for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It still works, just the top part is bent backwards some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better options out</li>
            <li> Great value, I really like the mustache/brow comb.</li>
            <li> One thing it didn&#x27;t come with is batteries, so make sure you get those too.</li>
            <li> After some intense research I decided to purchase this item which Amazon happens to offer at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this item.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it had light built in.</li>
            <li> so I am well acquainted with these men&#x27;s trimmers....</li>
            <li> I SURE as heck won&#x27;t pay for one after all this to find out, not even at this price.</li>
            <li> This one has two blades, situated at angles on the top.</li>
            <li> and I like this one a bit better</li>
            <li> I found that the rotary head works okay for the nose hair, but not for ear hair.</li>
            <li> There is an eyebrow addition which seems okay.</li>
            <li> What I mostly wanted this product for was for the brow trimmer aspect of it.</li>
            <li> Both heads cut well and appear to be designed so that one does not seem to be able to cut oneself</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have this trimmer.</li>
            <li> We received the  \\&quot;Remington Products NE3250 Nose, Ear and Brow Trimmer\\&quot; via the Vine Program to evaluate, and we found that, while it will get the job done, its functionality and design are just &#x27;OK.&#x27;</li>
            <li> One of the better ones we&#x27;ve used was a Panasonic kit that consisted of a separate pocket-sized nose trimmer and a single-bladed trimmer (which also worked well for bikini trimming)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, an ok product that just means one more gadget in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> There are many better options out there for woman.</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 if the trimmer had more than just one length</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this</li>
            <li> can trim your nose and ears up a bit after getting this, mostly nose.</li>
            <li> Yes? :-)</li>
            <li> He loves this product and says it works better than any he&#x27;s tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it recharge able</li>
            <li> I guess i&#x27;ll resort to the Panasonic trimmer that i hung on to because it had a better set of &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; attachments for beards etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trimming, not pulling:  The trimmer got nice clean cuts for hairs that stick out.  </li>
            <li> works great, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and very precise</li>
            <li> However, was able to easily return and receive a refund without delay.</li>
            <li> I can not recommend when I know there are better options available.</li>
            <li> Glad it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Love it useful thank you !</li>
            <li> Its not bad!  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;returned easily</li>
            <li> OK but not as good as my old item which just started to work again.</li>
            <li> Easily recommended for its sturdy build and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Easily maintains the stache.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has a loop in the handle so you can hang it in the bathroom for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coolest thing about this system</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know why everything breaks so easily.  </li>
            <li> The attachments for ear and nose trimming were easy to attach and remove.  </li>
            <li> The attachments and head are also easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is battery-powered rather than rechargeable, which is why I&#x27;m taking one star off, but otherwise this two-blade trimmer gets the job done neat and easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Breaks easily, but it is reliable</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t clogged and rinses easy.</li>
            <li> I also like the easy washout feature that allows me to rinse it in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First trimmer that arrived didn&#x27;t work, Amazon was nice enought to replace it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer work fine .</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the trimmer seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I like the eyebrow attachment a lot because its got fine combs on each side</li>
            <li> It has been working fine</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> When it doesn&#x27;t die it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> When they work they work fine</li>
            <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the hair and seems to cut it just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and a pleasure to use...</li>
            <li> The comb fits securely.</li>
            <li> So since it was cheap I just ordered another one.</li>
            <li> I thought i would give it another shot and picked one up at a local store, worked great for about a month</li>
            <li> Light trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great buy especially for the money.</li>
            <li> honestly, I can&#x27;t tell, because Neither ear, nor over-flowing nose hair seem too much of a nuisance for me.</li>
            <li> I recommended  the material isn&#x27;t too cheap and turning it on</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Light and compact and portable.</li>
            <li> I also experienced several cuts from the trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li> Kinda cheap quality</li>
            <li> just feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Turns out that the blades were stuck and required a water rinse to free them.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> In that short time the trimmer had become very warm to the touch even though the motor continued to not work.</li>
            <li> I liked that it had decent power when it was working</li>
            <li> The heads are easily exchangable, overall a good product.</li>
            <li> A better option for most would be to find a beard groomer that has different attachments and can do what this product does, and more.</li>
            <li> they recommend NOT using rechargeable batteries, saying it wil impair the function of the device (we tried both, and did not notice any real difference, but we assume they printed the warning for a valid reason!); thus, more battery cost and waste&lt;</li>
            <li> Original review  </li>
            <li> I use them to shorten the length and clean up the arch.  </li>
            <li> There is only one bright light here that the nose hair trimmer it worked well.</li>
            <li> Use it mainly for eye brows between haircuts, perfect every time, Just snap on eyebrow comb, one swipe left and one swipe right done.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer and eyebrow trimmer attachments are easily interchangeable and the unit as a whole is easy to wash by just running water over it.</li>
            <li> Cheap precision micro edge is seen on TV , worked better , gave more control, and the eyebrow guides actually helped.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this trimmer represents good value.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer really helps wrangle in my eye brow hairs and makes them look more presentable.</li>
            <li> , to summarize, while we feel this product would likely serve the needs of most consumers, we also feel that there are better options available.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well, but only lasted about 6 uses before it stopped powering on.</li>
            <li> Good for nose but don&#x27;t plan o use it on eyebrows, it doesn&#x27;t get a close enough shave!</li>
            <li> The only good thing is I got it quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof, easy to hold and operate, and does exactly what you expect.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works adequately as advertised.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so cheaply made, it never felt like the bottom &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; was ever securely in place, and the contacts would no longer align no matter how much I fiddled with it.</li>
            <li> However, Amazon was quick to refund my money.</li>
            <li> (the linear head is the one shown in the main picture of this product).&lt;br /&gt;The linear head works well for the ear, and the rotary head works better for the nose (although I still end up using a scissors once in a while).</li>
            <li> It is quick and painless.  </li>
            <li> My hair grows quickly</li>
            <li> I took good care of it too and kept it clean and dry.</li>
            <li> I love these little personal shavers because they are so easy to use and work great on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> For the price this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great little product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little tool for getting unwanted body hair out of the way.  </li>
            <li> Great little battery-powered nose-hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer and it worked great for a few weeks (5-6)  </li>
            <li> I really like the Remington MPT3800SSB Smooth and Silky Precision Trimmer.</li>
            <li> I would still consider it a really awesome trimmer with the exception if it being easily broken</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a product my husband can use on his own without complaints.  </li>
            <li> not something I find useful.  </li>
            <li> and I am not cutting off anything I don&#x27;t want to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great, but I took away a star because it does not have the same &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; attachment as my old Remington.  </li>
            <li> pool quality,not worth it</li>
            <li> Then never turned on again, even with a fresh battery.</li>
            <li> Gets hot when turned on and does not cut quickly.</li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s easy to rinse and if you need a deep clean, it has a really cool wash out system that flushes out all the nooks and</li>
            <li> Not the sellers fault, they did everything right.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> This is the right product for us hairy guys.  </li>
            <li> is the right additional part to ensure a continuous, even cut.</li>
            <li> Now it barely turns on and it didn&#x27;t even do that great of a job when it was actually working.</li>
            <li> As I turned it on, the noise level seemed relatively quiet, the trimmer fit my hand well, and was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer started off strong with a rubber grommet to seal out corrosion from moister on the motors; the downfall of many other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Easily frees my nose of pesky hair with the dual action blades.</li>
            <li> they lifts the hair right into the blade making trimming super easy and again let times to have to swipe back and forth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , otherwise, it&#x27;s a good little</li>
            <li> The build does feel a little cheap -- the plastic seems flimsy -- but for the price it is suitable.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was within the 30 return window and Amazon sent a new one right away.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Tried 4 different tested and working batteries just to be sure.  </li>
            <li> Freezes up and has to be helped to move after the first use and every use afterwards?</li>
            <li> The first time, it did not work after 3 weeks and the return policy was no longer valid.</li>
            <li> It broke the first day he used it.</li>
            <li> I made sure to change batteries several times, but the electric motor would not operate.  </li>
            <li> Worked OK for several months then just quit.</li>
            <li> Will pay more for something that actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pulled the battery, the end of the battery that came in contact with the motor has become quite hot.</li>
            <li> Died, ceased operating before first battery was used up.  </li>
            <li> But I can be sure it won&#x27;t short circuit from accidentally getting splashed in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic rechargeable similar unit for years which has more trimmer heads</li>
            <li> First one lasted six weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am either dealing with a defective device or the entire world has lost it&#x27;s mind:-)  </li>
            <li> It was pretty intuitive.  </li>
            <li> This attachment seems to work better, but overall, I cannot recommend this from my experience.</li>
            <li> Really nice trimmer, especially for ear and nose hair (don&#x27;t really have too much brow to be trimmed).</li>
            <li> One trick I learned from another reviewer is to push the eye brow hairs up, cover the parts you don&#x27;t want cut and only cut the top portion.</li>
            <li> Broke first day on the job.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts longer than the first one...</li>
            <li> wish the on/off function was a bit more obvious and an easier &amp;#34;click&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; to use, but you have to be pretty deliberate about it.  </li>
            <li> i got this trimmer for my father and I got to see him couple of months after receiving it, unfortunately it never worked.</li>
            <li> The first time it worked.  </li>
            <li> waste of money does not work good</li>
            <li> This trimmer works fairly well but it has a few problems.  </li>
            <li> ie, if you have no other options...since we have had much better experience with other makes/models; here are our findings in more detail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As expected, so far so good.</li>
            <li> It has nice sharp blades that really trim the hairs pretty much on the first swipe.</li>
            <li> Given the number of positive reviews (albeit ALL Vine it seems?)</li>
            <li> the swapping of the blades, the battery installation and the on/off function are all somewhat unobvious; they could be marked better and have more of a solid &#x27;click&#x27; when the proper twist position is achieved&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and seems well-built compared to similar devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it can be rinsed in water and hung up to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used these kinds of trimmers before and most have a single blade and work well.</li>
            <li> but is a tad large in terms of diameter.  </li>
            <li> I recommend use under supervision, or at least be sure the user knows there are guards to prevent full on defoliation!</li>
            <li> But I expected more than one use out of it.</li>
            <li> Just what wanted Thanks</li>
            <li> But with this Remington trimmer he says he doesn&#x27;t feel anything, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer works very well and the eyebrow trimmer does too.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li> I will carry this unit during travel because it&#x27;s very travel</li>
            <li> so I have to wait much longer than I should.</li>
            <li> treat my stuff gently</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> cleans my hairy nostrils up really</li>
            <li> He is very hairy, including lots of hair growing inside his ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet</li>
            <li> These did not work very well for me at all.</li>
            <li> &gt;▲ Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish it had was a light.  </li>
            <li> A gentle reminder...</li>
            <li> Worked great dropped it once broken</li>
            <li> Cheap chinese junk!!</li>
            <li> It’s simple to use, works better than the old one we had</li>
            <li> trimmer is small, light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> eyebrow combs make sure you don&#x27;t shave off your eyebrows accidently and creates a smooth look though only if you have some seriously wild and long hairs up there.  </li>
            <li> (okay, my nose) than the dedicated rotary blade that both it and my other trimmer have.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor and the two cutters are effective and don&#x27;t stall or snag like in my previous Remington MPT-3500B, which had a hard time even starting against its own</li>
            <li> Way better than my previous one.</li>
            <li> I cannot find a decent brand that is reliable.  </li>
            <li> I also have a Panasonic and older Wahl.</li>
            <li> it could use a storage pouch or travel box, since it consists of the main body, 2 separate heads and a brow</li>
            <li> although the main body has a lanyard loop, none is included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is much bigger than similar products but performs that much better.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare its functionality to other models, but I can say as a newbie to these devices that this was easy to use.</li>
            <li> There are two separate heads that are easy to change: one for the eyebrows and ear lobe, the other for nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to try it on my eyebrows, even though they are not thick, either.</li>
            <li> It was used for months before a counter level drup broke the product, so handle with care as the plastic is brittle, but overall worth the money.</li>
            <li> It simply croaked, tried fresh batteries, cleaning it, etc.</li>
            <li> but when I finally bought fresh AA batteries and tried it, I realized I bought a lemon.</li>
            <li> Better built that others, but I would still like to see a version of this that one could expect to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> No complaint in 1year.</li>
            <li> It does a good job on ears and nose, although my husband finds the vibration irritating in the nose area.  </li>
            <li> Worked great the first time I used it, sadly that was also the last time it worked.</li>
            <li> For as often as I use it I&#x27;ll live with it.</li>
            <li> It worked for a month and then stopped working even with a new battery.</li>
            <li> double blades give you a smooth, quiet shave that catches all hair.</li>
            <li> Overall i wish my wife had save whatever pittance she paid for this and spent it on coffee - it would have been a better investment.  </li>
            <li> power is OK, but the angle of the top is not good for woman, if you want to get an extra hair on your chin or above your lip or eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would not recommend to a woman is using it all over your face as some kind of catch all clean up because it can make your face feel bristly after a few days while the short hairs grow back out.</li>
            <li> Finally a nose hair trimmer that really works up there in the caverns!</li>
            <li> Cheap product not worth the price</li>
            <li> Like with all products one should read the directions first to learn how the battery is properly inserted and how the two heads function.</li>
            <li> I should have bought this one in the first place, rather than the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;The unit as pictured is with the eyebrow trimmer attached, the nose/ear hair attachment is the standard rounded tip.&lt;br /&gt;There are no problems with snagging or &amp;#34;nipping&amp;#34; and the eyebrow attachment is an added bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get my nasal passage all rubbed raw feeling either, worked very well and was comfortable to the touch.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is easy to handle and meets all of my expectations.  </li>
            <li> so I have to put this a little farther in my nose than makes me feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> - it feels a little sturdier and seems a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s double sided which is weird to get used to, but great.</li>
            <li> It provides a close cut and the clear plastic trimmer (not included in the picture)</li>
            <li> I wish they would let me buy just the clear plastic eyebrow attachment, but it does work well</li>
            <li> Will not waste my money on this brand again.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift, and so far, no complaints from them</li>
            <li> In ALL those years, this is only the 2Nd item I ever bought OR tried for free on the Vine Program that simply does not work.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it should efficiently and, thus far, without any problems.</li>
            <li> Kind of irritating when it comes without them</li>
            <li> only works well on noses and ears,but unlike other trimmers I have used, also works well on fine hairs.</li>
            <li> And the rotary head works fine on both--it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s an option on the Remington and the only choice on the other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get excited about a $12 trimmer, but these guys have really knocked one out of the park on this one.  </li>
            <li> and it never really worked right.</li>
            <li> so it was easy to manipulate and use making this a much better choice than tiny scissors (and not as dangerous aside from the problem</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but as a man, I wish it were a little more substantial and larger, it is just a bit too small as far as the trimmer goes.  </li>
            <li> I AM ALPHA MALE video blogs, and was looking for new trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Tried several new batteries to no avail.  </li>
            <li> trimmer is a decent size for a guys hand, not to thin so you can hold it easily.</li>
            <li> works well, but a little more lite duty than expected!</li>
            <li> My husband was excited to start a little Man-grooming, but he got over zealous, and now he&#x27;s waiting for the rest of his eyebrows to grow back...</li>
            <li> the ear/brow trimmer has a 2-blade design which doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as the single blade units we&#x27;ve used in the past; it works, but no where near as well as the single design&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes qwith many trim heads for those tough to get at areas.</li>
            <li> There is also an eyebrow comb with the package which helps to keep eyebrows aligned in the same direction and avoid wild looking eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have an old one i have from way back on those tv commercials</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks of light use it would not work only intermittently and finally it will not work at all.  </li>
            <li> if not careful you&#x27;ll end up opening the battery compartment rather than turning on the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the top part was easily broken.</li>
            <li> It can be used wet or dry and is very gentle--no hair pulling or skin pinching!</li>
            <li> The other trimmer I reviewed &amp;#34;Remington Dual Blade Detail Trimmer Eyebrows Nose Ear Sideburns MPT-3400C&amp;#34; despite its issue with rust, was a better model since at least it didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few weeks before first use, thus missed the return date window.</li>
            <li> Certainly didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected.  </li>
            <li> thing I especially like about this particular trimmer is that, unlike my other trimmer, it has a choice of blades.</li>
            <li> This thing is the SHIZZLE, except your gotta take care on sensitive areas, as it does &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; loose skin.</li>
            <li> and I really like the fact that it can be used wet and or dry.</li>
            <li> Its also wet dry capable</li>
            <li> I had an older model with a single cutting edge and it seems to have worked better.</li>
            <li> As per other reviews it only lasted a couple of times and quit completely.</li>
            <li> Took it out of the box the whole head came off, thought it was normal, tried putting it back on, looked it up was broken.</li>
            <li> Only used for a week or so but hopefully will last as long as my Wahl which is still kicking after 5 years.</li>
            <li> I usually get ones you see on tv but got tired of it and went with a little bit higher model, not to mention it didn&#x27;t cost any more than those.  </li>
            <li> not so easy to use, the &#x27;blades&#x27; are weird and short, and ineffective.</li>
            <li> New batteries, still dead.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll have to live with a few months.</li>
            <li> Twisting it on and off (with wet hands from shaving) is probably the most difficult thing about this.  </li>
            <li> Kind of difficult to cut above my ears because the head is so small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other more expensive trimmers out there that use a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> The only reason I nicked a star is due to its not shipping with a battery (this is standard practice for my reviews)</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t designed for nose hairs only for other hairs such around your ears or for brows that the combs can&#x27;t lift up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer piece has the blades recessed a little too far under the safety shield</li>
            <li> The double-sided trim head is at an odd angle and hard to get a close trim at certain angles in general it feels clunky in the hand.</li>
            <li> the 1st one I got lasted about 6 months before the inner workings jammed...</li>
            <li> Having a hairy husband was an excuse to try this one out.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use it for eyebrows, and as nose hair trimmer it didn&#x27;t tangle up long nose hairs like some products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer simply does NOT cut hairs in your nose, ears or any other part of the body.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Performance is on par with other similar products.  </li>
            <li> am on 3rd  replacement, due to overseas travel</li>
            <li> this thing is just awkward for me to use, I generally use a groomer to trim my sideburns up around my ears, the regular Remington Microscreen triple foil has the trimmer pop up and that works fine as do regular small buzzer groomers...</li>
            <li> or dry use:  </li>
            <li> And yet Remington keeps putting out these crappy trimmers that only last a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, this trimmer is going to help me look at least a little younger for a little longer.</li>
            <li> On-Off is achieved by turning the back of the body - would rather a conventional switch.  </li>
            <li> But this one with a single AA battery seems to work well and get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a handy trimmer to have around, but I must admit that I have been a bit disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Well, after weeks of the motor slowing down, it finally broke.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> If you need a single use trimmer, this one is for you!</li>
            <li> It made it awkward when blindly trimming my neck hair, never knew what way the blades were facing, whereas a single blade you can plant it down and trim knowing right where it is touching.</li>
            <li> It has been my experience with the Remington NE3250 that the small, flat blade is actually easier to deal with in one&#x27;s nose</li>
            <li> The eye brow adapter a little bit big to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> Only worked for a few months then died.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to, works as expected.</li>
            <li> Completely dead on second use.</li>
            <li> Sorry to the manufacturer in advance if mine was just a rare case.</li>
            <li> But you can use it when your hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap material, disappointed buy.</li>
            <li> And, since he has used a variety of hair trimmers before, that lets me get a feel for how this trimmer compares to other models.  </li>
            <li> He said it felt safer and was easier to use than other trimmers he has used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t figured out the brow trimmer and find a small comb and scissors does the job well enough.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few months, if it lasts that long.</li>
            <li> it comes with 2 attachments, one is a comb for eyebrows and the other for nose/ears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably recommend other products that you can just swap the heads of the trimmer to a shaver and etc instead though.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet and has a small vibration</li>
            <li> You can use the linear head to do other trimming on the brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before, so I can&#x27;t compare to other brands.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove nose hair as well as some other ones I have had.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred​ a different on and off switch as it&#x27;s a little annoying that I have to be careful not to open the battery compartment, but that&#x27;s pretty minor.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer attachment worked well, but everything else was a disappointment especially the main trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this product is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late thirties, and hair is starting to grow out of those places it tends to grow as you age.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> and it feels very uncomfortable quickly.  </li>
            <li> I wrote the review above immediately after the second failed attempt.</li>
            <li> It worked less than 10 times before it didn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> This one does the job, slightly bulkier, but it cuts my hair.</li>
            <li> I used to use the round ended nose hair trimmers and it seemed like it took forever to get everything trimmed down.  </li>
            <li> No special cleaning has been required.  </li>
            <li> It has LITTLE power for nose/ear hairs...</li>
            <li> I usually listen to other reviewers so shame on me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to take care of little guy grooming concerns.</li>
            <li> Works a little TOO well...</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I tried replacing the battery, dead as a door nail.</li>
            <li> Not going for round three.</li>
            <li> It cuts closer and quicker than the round ones.  </li>
            <li> also, I purchased a Microtouch trimmer that broke after a few months too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with garbage.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> I used both alkaline AND fully charged rechargeable batteries (which poor directions advise not to use) and same result.</li>
            <li> I have a fascination with a haircut to these narrow spaces.  </li>
            <li> My eye brows are insane and they have a mind of their own.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t waste your dollars on this one.</li>
            <li> Switch design is not comfortable</li>
            <li> heads stopped working within a few uses</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for Christmas 2014, as of Feb 25, 2015 it is dead.  </li>
            <li> To me 1 drop &#x3D; dead &#x3D; garbage.  </li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> I kept it in the box and wasn&#x27;t dropped or anything so not sure why.  </li>
            <li> Being a Vine item, I am not able to return it to exchange in case</li>
            <li> So I hate to give 1 star and not have any useful info</li>
            <li> I have used another trimmer in the past</li>
            <li> The trimmer is small.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;ve had a separate nose trimmer and eyebrow trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product combines both in one, and can also be used for trimming small hairs growing around or in the ear lobe (not for the ear canal).</li>
            <li> So, not sure why it just broke on me.</li>
            <li> It is not a very good product.</li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> Still sucks.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no sense in belaboring the point here, as this isn&#x27;t a complicated piece of business.</li>
            <li> The combination of the three cutting functions of eyebrows, nose hairs, and ear hairs with the two different heads worked quite well for me.</li>
            <li> This thing sucks.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow attachment scrapes and does not effectively trim.</li>
            <li> The double blade trimmer is poorly designed making it difficult to see where the blades are.</li>
            <li> Takes one AA battery, which on the downside, wastes batteries, but on the upside, means you don&#x27;t have to worry about recharging or taking a charger on trips, or worse, the battery slowly dying (permanently) over time.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Not good....</li>
            <li> But the build quality of these are pretty horrible</li>
            <li> Unfortunately cannot return as it is past return policy date.</li>
            <li> The cutting end on these are at an odd angle.  </li>
            <li> This thing worked for about a week and it broken.  </li>
            <li> Bulky, narrow cutting edge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The nose cap inside clip was broken, so trimmer could not be installed.</li>
            <li> It was broken when I opened it</li>
            <li> so I guess, in this case, I got caught with a poor quality product.</li>
            <li> Worked for approximately 2.5 times.</li>
            <li> Came broken.</li>
            <li> but it works and hasnt broken,</li>
            <li> This all speaks to the poor design.  </li>
            <li> that only shows how bad the quality is !</li>
            <li> It has an awkward trimming head which made it hard to trim the hair on the edge and around of my ears.</li>
            <li> , at least I didn&#x27;t have any problem cutting hair without nicking or pulling any skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s passed the 30 day return policy.</li>
            <li> But, the design for turning on an doff is weird.</li>
            <li> The trimmer attachment is utterly useless.</li>
            <li> But for the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Garbage junk hate it don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> A completely very poor product.  </li>
            <li> Two very poor designs.  </li>
            <li> Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> As an eyebrow trimmer, the awkward head/attachment made it so you had to work at it to keep the brows an even length and get all the stragglers.</li>
            <li> Bad:  </li>
            <li> I guess I got a bad one.</li>
            <li> i promise you, its bad.</li>
            <li> I thought my batteries were bad when I couldn&#x27;t get this crap to work.</li>
            <li> I just add a drop of oil to lubricate the cutting blade once per year!</li>
            <li> What a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  </li>
            <li> Uses 1 AA battery (not included) and turns on/off  by twisting the base.</li>
            <li> On/off is achieved by turning the base.  </li>
            <li> I hate the twist switch.</li>
            <li> If you hate nose/ear hair as I do this</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, after 1 month it won&#x27;t turn on unless I remove the cutter attachment.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Aside from my experience, the ergonomics are horrible as is the on/off mechanism.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This thing worked for about a week and it broken.  Piece of Junk!</li>
            <li> not working , used 6 x,s</li>
            <li> Just that they forgot to mention it was battery operated.Battery not included.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get excited about a $12 trimmer, but these guys have really knocked one out of the park on this one.  It&#x27;s waterproof, the blade thingies don&#x27;t pull or prick, it has a couple of attachments, and it&#x27;s surprisingly well built.  I bought one for everybody in the family - all of them are still running and everybody loves it -</li>
            <li> This is a great product for nose hair trimming. It was used for months before a counter level drup broke the product, so handle with care as the plastic is brittle, but overall worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bulky, narrow cutting edge.  Cheap precision micro edge is seen on TV , worked better , gave more control, and the eyebrow guides actually helped. The on off switch is part of the battery holder . One twist for on opposite direction For removing battery . Separate switch is better.</li>
            <li> after one day of use the area that comes in contact with the skin became overheated&lt;br /&gt;returned easily</li>
            <li> Excellent, easy to use and safe.  The item arrived a day before the scheduled date.  I am very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> The only thing this thing has going for it was the price. For as often as I use it I&#x27;ll live with it. What a piece of crap. If I were Remington I&#x27;d be embarrassed. Not the sellers fault, they did everything right.</li>
            <li> It has LITTLE power for nose/ear hairs...the last one we had used 2 AA batteries and wish I could find one like I had.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it would be.  It does better than scissors or the rotating blades.</li>
            <li> OK but not as good as my old item which just started to work again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda satisfy :-)</li>
            <li> very nice product. It does all it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> eh... it is a bit temperamental</li>
            <li> Excellent Item and Fast Shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Worked one time, then never worked again.</li>
            <li> Have used these before and know that they don&#x27;t last forever. But I expected more than one use out of it. That&#x27;s right, I used it once and it never worked again. Will not waste my money on this brand again.</li>
            <li> Only worked for a few months then died.</li>
            <li> Just what wanted Thanks</li>
            <li> This thing is the SHIZZLE, except your gotta take care on sensitive areas, as it does &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; loose skin.</li>
            <li> Good quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to, works as expected.</li>
            <li> great product and trimming is easy and precise.</li>
            <li> As per other reviews it only lasted a couple of times and quit completely. I usually listen to other reviewers so shame on me. It is not a very good product. Remington is supposed to have a better reputation.</li>
            <li> Relly didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I love this trimer it is best I ever owned</li>
            <li> Finally a nose hair trimmer that really works up there in the caverns!</li>
            <li> Only had it for two months, and it no longer works.</li>
            <li> The trimmer work fine . I was expecting for a closer trim . Therefore I rated a 3 star for that reason</li>
            <li> On-Off is achieved by turning the back of the body - would rather a conventional switch.  Otherwise, the trimmer seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Way better than my previous one. I wasn&#x27;t sure it was even working because I couldn&#x27;t hear the snipping and, thankfully, I didn&#x27;t feel any tugging.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and a pleasure to use...well, as pleasurable as possible when one is trimming their nose hair. I would have preferred​ a different on and off switch as it&#x27;s a little annoying that I have to be careful not to open the battery compartment, but that&#x27;s pretty minor.</li>
            <li> Used twice and stopped working.  I cannot find a decent brand that is reliable.  Amazon is refunding the cost of the item.</li>
            <li> Lasted about one week and would not power on.  Tried 4 different tested and working batteries just to be sure.  I liked that it had decent power when it was working but didn&#x27;t like how the two blades cut from both sides like a shrub trimmer.  It made it awkward when blindly trimming my neck hair, never knew what way the blades were facing, whereas a single blade you can plant it down and trim knowing right where it is touching. One blade with more power to it would be better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Worked great the first time I used it, sadly that was also the last time it worked. It simply croaked, tried fresh batteries, cleaning it, etc. If you need a single use trimmer, this one is for you!</li>
            <li> Worked for a while freezes up</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to turn on and off. Comes qwith many trim heads for those tough to get at areas.</li>
            <li> What is not to like. It works as advertised and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but as a man, I wish it were a little more substantial and larger, it is just a bit too small as far as the trimmer goes.  It does work though, no problem there.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works adequately as advertised. The only fault was the lack of basic instructions such as how the battery compartment is accessed and how the two heads can be switched.</li>
            <li> Trimmer trims nicely... when it works.  Freezes up and has to be helped to move after the first use and every use afterwards? My nose hair isn&#x27;t made of barbed wire.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a great little trimmer. The comb fits securely. The length of hair that it leaves is appropriate for eyebrows. The nose hair trimmer attachment works well. This item can be used in the shower. For the price I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchased this twice. The first time, it did not work after 3 weeks and the return policy was no longer valid. So since it was cheap I just ordered another one. The second one did not work after 3 weeks. What a waste!</li>
            <li> This is awesome. I got it for my boyfirend for Christmas. He loves it. But the top part was easily broken. It still works, just the top part is bent backwards some. It broke the first day he used it. I would still consider it a really awesome trimmer with the exception if it being easily broken</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift, and so far, no complaints from them</li>
            <li> It seems like a trimmer should be no problem at all to make last.  And yet Remington keeps putting out these crappy trimmers that only last a few uses.  It worked great while it lasted but it doesn&#x27;t last.  I tried everything to get it working again and I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li> This trimmer simply does NOT cut hairs in your nose, ears or any other part of the body.  I had another trimmer for years.  I could be done in 2 minutes.  I stood there for 5 minutes trying to get this thing to trim any hair.  One hair.  Nope.  I threw it away</li>
            <li> Great little product.  I usually get ones you see on tv but got tired of it and went with a little bit higher model, not to mention it didn&#x27;t cost any more than those.  It&#x27;s double sided which is weird to get used to, but great.</li>
            <li> Broke within two months.</li>
            <li> We received this and it didn&#x27;t work. We replaced battery, and it still didn&#x27;t work. Dissatisfied customer.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this product is not worth it.  I purchased this product and within 3 months it was not working.  I made sure to change batteries several times, but the electric motor would not operate.  I&#x27;m sure there are better options out that and I will be looking for them.</li>
            <li> Love it useful thank you !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 weeks and it just stopped working. New batteries, still dead. I definitely expect a longer lifespan than 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well with attachments and seems sturdy. Only used for a week or so but hopefully will last as long as my Wahl which is still kicking after 5 years.</li>
            <li> Worked for a month or so then started burning batteries even when it was off.</li>
            <li> Worked OK for several months then just quit. I think it&#x27;s the switch, which you operating by just twisting the bottom section until  2 metal contacts inside line up. But it&#x27;s so cheaply made, it never felt like the bottom &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; was ever securely in place, and the contacts would no longer align no matter how much I fiddled with it. Will pay more for something that actually works.</li>
            <li> Present for my husband..Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints. I know it requires one Double A Battery that isn&#x27;t included. Also had multiple attachments.</li>
            <li> Died after only one use. Worked great that one time.... Completely dead on second use. Replacing battery did not help. Had it for a few weeks before first use, thus missed the return date window. Sigh....  Update: I wrote the review above immediately after the second failed attempt. After posting I picked up the trimmer that was lying on my desk while I wrote the review. In that short time the trimmer had become very warm to the touch even though the motor continued to not work. I&#x27;ve pulled the battery, the end of the battery that came in contact with the motor has become quite hot. Not good....</li>
            <li> My nose and ears seem to be cleaner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a product my husband can use on his own without complaints.  Before this neat trimmer I would get the tiny scissors out and trim his unsightly hairs.  Then I started using another trimmer that ran on triple-A batteries.  He swore that trimmer caused him discomfort.  But with this Remington trimmer he says he doesn&#x27;t feel anything, and it works really well.  Good job, Remington.</li>
            <li> It can be used wet or dry and is very gentle--no hair pulling or skin pinching! Takes one AA battery, which on the downside, wastes batteries, but on the upside, means you don&#x27;t have to worry about recharging or taking a charger on trips, or worse, the battery slowly dying (permanently) over time.</li>
            <li> Easily recommended for its sturdy build and effectiveness. The nose hair trimmer works very well and the eyebrow trimmer does too. The trimmer also comes with a detachable comb attachment so you don&#x27;t accidentally shave off an eyebrow and leave yourself looking like Bob Geldof in &amp;#34;Pink Floyd&#x27;s The Wall&amp;#34;. The nose trimmer and eyebrow trimmer attachments are easily interchangeable and the unit as a whole is easy to wash by just running water over it.</li>
            <li> FOR THE PRICE DOES THE TRICK</li>
            <li> Died, ceased operating before first battery was used up.  I tried replacing the battery, dead as a door nail.</li>
            <li> KEEPS EVERYTHING TRIMMED WHAT CAN I SAY WE ALL HAVE OUR SECRETS BEATS WAXING LOL</li>
            <li> Great value, I really like the mustache/brow comb. Easily maintains the stache.</li>
            <li> Cheap product not worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late thirties, and hair is starting to grow out of those places it tends to grow as you age. Luckily, this trimmer is going to help me look at least a little younger for a little longer. I have never used one of these before so I can&#x27;t compare its functionality to other models, but I can say as a newbie to these devices that this was easy to use. The build does feel a little cheap -- the plastic seems flimsy -- but for the price it is suitable.</li>
            <li> I give this a 2 because the battery seems to drain while it&#x27;s not in use.</li>
            <li> Does the job well for the purpose intended</li>
            <li> I ordered this after I saw it recommended on a men&#x27;s style blog.  Didn&#x27;t work out of the package sent it back and got a refund.  I thought i would give it another shot and picked one up at a local store, worked great for about a month and now it won&#x27;t turn on.  Spend your money on another brand.</li>
            <li> This product works great!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. As advertised.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is easy to handle and meets all of my expectations.  Trims eye brows, nose and hear hair with ease.  I have never cut skin or felt heat from this trimmer.  I would give it 5 stars if the blades were just a tad longer.  The batteries have lasted 6 months and still have plenty of power.  No special cleaning has been required.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Light trimmer. Works very well.</li>
            <li> First trimmer that arrived didn&#x27;t work, Amazon was nice enought to replace it. Second trimmer worked on two occasions and stopped working. Unfortunately it&#x27;s passed the 30 day return policy. Do not buy this product! Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> It worked less than 10 times before it didn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> This Remington NE3250 works great. It’s simple to use, works better than the old one we had (Walmart $8 trimmer) so it’s a keeper. Would recommend as a gift!</li>
            <li> This trimmer had a lot of extra features I wasn&#x27;t expecting. One thing it didn&#x27;t come with is batteries, so make sure you get those too. Kind of irritating when it comes without them and you don&#x27;t have any in the house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The double blades give you a smooth, quiet shave that catches all hair. It didn&#x27;t cut the face like some do and it is waterproof so we can use it in the shower. It has a loop in the handle so you can hang it in the bathroom for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coolest thing about this system is that it&#x27;s easy to rinse and if you need a deep clean, it has a really cool wash out system that flushes out all the nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a good trimmer, I just wish it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I have a multi-attachment Remington beard trimmer which I used before for trimming ear hairs. I decided to try this one in its place. The two blades make it easier for me to reach hairs on my ears. It is easy to use and seems well-built compared to similar devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep this one in my travel bag to use on the road I think.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well.  It&#x27;s waterproof, easy to hold and operate, and does exactly what you expect.  The package I received did not have a lanyard connector as instructions stated were included.  I did find myself having to read the instructions to insert the battery and change the trimmer heads.  It&#x27;s just not intuitive until you&#x27;ve done it once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance is on par with other similar products.  This unit has the advantage of being waterproof and thus impervious to splashes or showers.  You can use it in the shower...not something I find useful.  But I can be sure it won&#x27;t short circuit from accidentally getting splashed in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a rubberized body and good feel and controls operate smoothly.  Overall, I think this trimmer represents good value.  I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic rechargeable similar unit for years which has more trimmer heads and I&#x27;ll probably stick with that.  I will carry this unit during travel because it&#x27;s very travel friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Okay but not the greatest product but it works.</li>
            <li> After some intense research I decided to purchase this item which Amazon happens to offer at a great price. This product is everything I needed and I really like the fact that it can be used wet and or dry. It is battery operated which is the only thing I would change.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and very precise</li>
            <li> I like that it has several different heads for different purposes.</li>
            <li> The Good:  Gets close without razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:  First one lasted six weeks.  Second lasted seven weeks.  Not going for round three.</li>
            <li> I used to use the round ended nose hair trimmers and it seemed like it took forever to get everything trimmed down.  With this one I make one rotation and I&#x27;m done.  It cuts closer and quicker than the round ones.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this item.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Good quality</li>
            <li> A completely very poor product.  Should never be put up for sale.  Was used with ividence of hair inside the nose cone.&lt;br /&gt;The nose cap inside clip was broken, so trimmer could not be installed.</li>
            <li> One word, Cheaply made.!!!</li>
            <li> waste of money does not work good</li>
            <li> works well. But, the design for turning on an doff is weird. It kill a couple of brain cells for figuring out how to turn on.</li>
            <li> got myself in a hairy situation and this helps me out monthly.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  Stopped working after second use.</li>
            <li> I used it 2 x but the 3rd time it wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore. I changed the battery but no luck.  I kept it in the box and wasn&#x27;t dropped or anything so not sure why.  Remington is a good name and I didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 3-4 uses - a battery change didn&#x27;t fix the problem. However, Amazon was quick to refund my money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Have to return product &amp; order another so I have to wait much longer than I should.</li>
            <li> Worked for 2 months and became garbage...</li>
            <li> Gets hot when turned on and does not cut quickly. Rips hair out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer and it worked great for a few weeks (5-6)  then it stopped .  The trimmer head broke and i had to glue it back.  then i had to return it to get another and I got a refund .  I used the refund to buy the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That too broke, but this time after a 4 months the motor stopped.  I wish someone would make a battery operated trimmer that lasts......oh, well.  also, I purchased a Microtouch trimmer that broke after a few months too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I treat my stuff gently so I don&#x27;t know why everything breaks so easily.  I bought a Platinum XL last week so I hope that will last.  fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer. Uses 1 AA battery (not included) and turns on/off  by twisting the base. As I turned it on, the noise level seemed relatively quiet, the trimmer fit my hand well, and was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only works well on noses and ears,but unlike other trimmers I have used, also works well on fine hairs. I have not tried the eyebrow attachment yet, but it is included with the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on using in the shower as I don&#x27;t have a mirror,but it is water resistant for those that do.</li>
            <li> The cutting end on these are at an odd angle.  On/off is achieved by turning the base.  Two very poor designs.  I can not recommend when I know there are better options available.</li>
            <li> This works great for my purpose.  Good power and glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> cleans my hairy nostrils up really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend will now go out in public with me</li>
            <li> the 1st one I got lasted about 6 months before the inner workings jammed...I have another and after a month&#x27;s use it is also starting to jam...</li>
            <li> Works as well as it should for the price its great</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get my nasal passage all rubbed raw feeling either, worked very well and was comfortable to the touch. Very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes just 1 AA battery and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Great and water proof too!!!</li>
            <li> Great seller all is ok!!!</li>
            <li> Very cheap material, disappointed buy. However, was able to easily return and receive a refund without delay.</li>
            <li> Its not bad!  Good price!</li>
            <li> Terrible product, after 1 month it won&#x27;t turn on unless I remove the cutter attachment.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with garbage.</li>
            <li> Bought one at walmart to replace a Wahl trimmer. This one does the job, slightly bulkier, but it cuts my hair. Would be nice if it had light built in. I hate the twist switch.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time &amp; money. I thought my batteries were bad when I couldn&#x27;t get this crap to work. It took a while but when I finally bought fresh AA batteries and tried it, I realized I bought a lemon. Sucks. The only good thing is I got it quickly. Still sucks.</li>
            <li> To begin with, this is review #264 for me in all my years at Amazon. In ALL those years, this is only the 2Nd item I ever bought OR tried for free on the Vine Program that simply does not work. I will be 65 years of age the end of this month so I am well acquainted with these men&#x27;s trimmers....But all of mine have always worked. My Norelco (before even Phillips bought them) is STILL working after probably 20 years. I just add a drop of oil to lubricate the cutting blade once per year! I also have a Panasonic and older Wahl. They all work. Now this one &amp;#34;works, the motor spins the blades or spins &amp;#34;SOMETHING&amp;#34; but cuts nothing. I mean nothing at all. I tried for a week now using both attachments and same result. I have plenty to trim, just that I put this to ANY form of hair anywhere on my body in vain attempts to see if it will cut, and get nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Being a Vine item, I am not able to return it to exchange in case I have a defective unit. I SURE as heck won&#x27;t pay for one after all this to find out, not even at this price. Given the number of positive reviews (albeit ALL Vine it seems?) I am either dealing with a defective device or the entire world has lost it&#x27;s mind:-)  So I hate to give 1 star and not have any useful info but it is what I have to do. I used both alkaline AND fully charged rechargeable batteries (which poor directions advise not to use) and same result. I get motor whirring away, my hair LAUGHING back at it....I have owned a dozen of these devices, I would pass on this one given what I see, feel and experience. Sorry to the manufacturer in advance if mine was just a rare case.</li>
            <li> I always want an ear and nose trimmer when I see them, even though I have no ear or nose hair.  I have a fascination with a haircut to these narrow spaces.  Having a hairy husband was an excuse to try this one out.  And, since he has used a variety of hair trimmers before, that lets me get a feel for how this trimmer compares to other models.  He is very hairy, including lots of hair growing inside his ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet or dry use:  This trimmer can be used wet or dry.  It takes batteries, and the place the batteries go in is not waterproof.  So, you can&#x27;t expect to submerge this or use it while standing under a shower stream.  But you can use it when your hair is wet.  The head is also designed to be rinsed, so you can rinse the head and keep trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cuts, no nicks:  The trimmer comes with attachments for brow and nose trimming.  The default, with no attachment is for the ear.  My husband shaved his hairy and gross nose and ears with this and didn&#x27;t get cuts.  He said it felt safer and was easier to use than other trimmers he has used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming, not pulling:  The trimmer got nice clean cuts for hairs that stick out.  There was no feeling that it pulled hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to swap out attachments:  The attachments for ear and nose trimming were easy to attach and remove.  It was pretty intuitive.  The attachments and head are also easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a handy trimmer to have around, but I must admit that I have been a bit disappointed with this product. I have used these kinds of trimmers before and most have a single blade and work well. This one has two blades, situated at angles on the top. These did not work very well for me at all. It also has an additional attachment for trimming nose hairs and ear hair. This attachment seems to work better, but overall, I cannot recommend this from my experience. A better option for most would be to find a beard groomer that has different attachments and can do what this product does, and more.</li>
            <li> Really nice trimmer, especially for ear and nose hair (don&#x27;t really have too much brow to be trimmed). I have used another trimmer in the past and I like this one a bit better - it feels a little sturdier and seems a little more powerful. This is battery-powered rather than rechargeable, which is why I&#x27;m taking one star off, but otherwise this two-blade trimmer gets the job done neat and easy.</li>
            <li> Great buy especially for the money.</li>
            <li> SEE YA NOSE HAIRS!! LOL</li>
            <li> It does a good job on ears and nose, although my husband finds the vibration irritating in the nose area.  Still haven&#x27;t figured out the brow trimmer and find a small comb and scissors does the job well enough.</li>
            <li> It worked great for 1time. Since then I replaced the battery and still no luck. I will be contacting Amazon for a credit.</li>
            <li> works well, but a little more lite duty than expected!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Easy to use.  Great design.</li>
            <li> Great quality and battery life.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper trimmer before this. It was also battery operated but it had only the rotary head. I found that the rotary head works okay for the nose hair, but not for ear hair. So I decided to try this trimmer with the linear head (the linear head is the one shown in the main picture of this product).&lt;br /&gt;The linear head works well for the ear, and the rotary head works better for the nose (although I still end up using a scissors once in a while). There is an eyebrow addition which seems okay. But I don&#x27;t use it because my brows are not that long.&lt;br /&gt;There are other more expensive trimmers out there that use a rechargeable battery. But this one with a single AA battery seems to work well and get the job done. I would consider it a great buy at 15 bucks or so.</li>
            <li> Great product, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had an older model with a single cutting edge and it seems to have worked better.</li>
            <li> What I mostly wanted this product for was for the brow trimmer aspect of it. My eye brows are insane and they have a mind of their own. This trimmer really helps wrangle in my eye brow hairs and makes them look more presentable. One trick I learned from another reviewer is to push the eye brow hairs up, cover the parts you don&#x27;t want cut and only cut the top portion. That trick works well and I am not cutting off anything I don&#x27;t want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is small, light weight and easy to use. The heads are easily exchangable, overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Despite having reviewed a different trimmer for Vine, I figured I can always use a second so that I can leave one at my parents&#x27; house since their health requires that I travel to visit them often. The Remington Products NE3250 Nose, Ear and Brow Trimmer looked like a good candidate, so I accepted one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I especially like about this particular trimmer is that, unlike my other trimmer, it has a choice of blades. It has been my experience with the Remington NE3250 that the small, flat blade is actually easier to deal with in one&#x27;s nose (okay, my nose) than the dedicated rotary blade that both it and my other trimmer have. And the rotary head works fine on both--it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s an option on the Remington and the only choice on the other. So kudos for that. I can&#x27;t comment on the practicality of the eyebrow comb because it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ll ever use, but the two heads I do use work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington Products NE3250 can be rinsed underwater, which lots of users will find practical. There&#x27;s really no sense in belaboring the point here, as this isn&#x27;t a complicated piece of business. The only reason I nicked a star is due to its not shipping with a battery (this is standard practice for my reviews), otherwise, it&#x27;s a good little trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: highly recommended. Remington, ship with a battery!</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.Will update in a few months, if it lasts that long.</li>
            <li> Two stars are for the semi-useful nose and ear trimmers. The trimmer attachment is utterly useless. Glad it was cheap. But don&#x27;t waste your dollars on this one.</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer works as advertised.</li>
            <li> A dandy appliance that actually follows the shape of the nose.  I love that it can be rinsed in water and hung up to dry.  Optional accessories included are a plus.  Well done.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to take care of little guy grooming concerns. He likes it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool for getting unwanted body hair out of the way.  It is quick and painless.  It&#x27;s also for above-the-neck only! so don&#x27;t try it on your bikini area.</li>
            <li> The trim feature seems to work, however it doesn&#x27;t seem to get in those hard-to-reach spots like just below the nose. the Ear and nose trimmer ... honestly, I can&#x27;t tell, because Neither ear, nor over-flowing nose hair seem too much of a nuisance for me. The trimmer is small. light and easy to handle. Nice design for the jobs it&#x27;s designed to handle.</li>
            <li> Actually bought this on a whim at Target (same price as Amazon).  Powerful motor and the two cutters are effective and don&#x27;t stall or snag like in my previous Remington MPT-3500B, which had a hard time even starting against its own friction.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I would (have Remington) do differently is make the twist on/off switch require a longer twist to have the cap open to reveal the battery compartment.  But not a show-stopper.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;ve had a separate nose trimmer and eyebrow trimmer. This product combines both in one, and can also be used for trimming small hairs growing around or in the ear lobe (not for the ear canal). There are two separate heads that are easy to change: one for the eyebrows and ear lobe, the other for nose hairs. My hair grows quickly so I have to trim regularly to look well groomed. Both heads cut well and appear to be designed so that one does not seem to be able to cut oneself, at least I didn&#x27;t have any problem cutting hair without nicking or pulling any skin. There is also an eyebrow comb with the package which helps to keep eyebrows aligned in the same direction and avoid wild looking eyebrows. The combination of the three cutting functions of eyebrows, nose hairs, and ear hairs with the two different heads worked quite well for me. I was pleased with this product and recommend it to others. Like with all products one should read the directions first to learn how the battery is properly inserted and how the two heads function.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have this trimmer. I have an old one i have from way back on those tv commercials and it never really worked right. This trimmer is great! It has nice sharp blades that really trim the hairs pretty much on the first swipe. Its got a great pointy trimmer tip so you can see what your doing. Its also wet dry capable so you can rinse the blades under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs on one, yes one AA battery which is also a plus. it comes with 2 attachments, one is a comb for eyebrows and the other for nose/ears. I like the eyebrow attachment a lot because its got fine combs on each side they lifts the hair right into the blade making trimming super easy and again let times to have to swipe back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a decent size for a guys hand, not to thin so you can hold it easily. it has a loop on the end to hand on a hook or something if you trim in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good trimmer and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love these little personal shavers because they are so easy to use and work great on my eyebrows.  I use them to shorten the length and clean up the arch.  I also use it on my son&#x27;s to keep his unibrow at bay!  The only thing I would not recommend to a woman is using it all over your face as some kind of catch all clean up because it can make your face feel bristly after a few days while the short hairs grow back out.</li>
            <li> After using this Remington NE3250 Nose, Ear and Brow Trimmer for several weeks, I can say that it is a very solid product. It does what it says it should efficiently and, thus far, without any problems. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Breaks easily, but it is reliable</li>
            <li> It worked for a month and then stopped working even with a new battery.</li>
            <li> We received the  \\&quot;Remington Products NE3250 Nose, Ear and Brow Trimmer\\&quot; via the Vine Program to evaluate, and we found that, while it will get the job done, its functionality and design are just &#x27;OK.&#x27; We can only half-heartedly recommend it...ie, if you have no other options...since we have had much better experience with other makes/models; here are our findings in more detail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses (▲):&lt;br /&gt;▲ Nice grip and heft&lt;br /&gt;▲ Wet/dry functionality&lt;br /&gt;▲ Swappable rotary attachments (nose trimmer and ear/brow trimmer)&lt;br /&gt;▲ Includes a comb attachment (it clips on to the ear trimmer blade)&lt;br /&gt;▲ Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses (▼)&lt;br /&gt;▼ the ear/brow trimmer has a 2-blade design which doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as the single blade units we&#x27;ve used in the past; it works, but no where near as well as the single design&lt;br /&gt;▼ the swapping of the blades, the battery installation and the on/off function are all somewhat unobvious; they could be marked better and have more of a solid &#x27;click&#x27; when the proper twist position is achieved&lt;br /&gt;▼ they recommend NOT using rechargeable batteries, saying it wil impair the function of the device (we tried both, and did not notice any real difference, but we assume they printed the warning for a valid reason!); thus, more battery cost and waste&lt;br /&gt;▼ it could use a storage pouch or travel box, since it consists of the main body, 2 separate heads and a brow comb.&lt;br /&gt;▼ although the main body has a lanyard loop, none is included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to summarize, while we feel this product would likely serve the needs of most consumers, we also feel that there are better options available. One of the better ones we&#x27;ve used was a Panasonic kit that consisted of a separate pocket-sized nose trimmer and a single-bladed trimmer (which also worked well for bikini trimming)...ie, both were stand-alone units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had many other similar products in the past, so other than the eyebrow trimmer it performed the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn&#x27;t use it for eyebrows, and as nose hair trimmer it didn&#x27;t tangle up long nose hairs like some products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an ok product that just means one more gadget in the bathroom. I&#x27;d probably recommend other products that you can just swap the heads of the trimmer to a shaver and etc instead though.</li>
            <li> For the price, the Remington NE3250 Nose, Ear, and Brow Trimmer is a great product, but the Brow Attachment Head/Blade seems to stop the device from working after each use.  I&#x27;ve had to remove the attachment and unjam it.  I&#x27;d like to know why it jams.</li>
            <li> Perfect product. I would recommend this to everybody.</li>
            <li> Great grooming tool for travel. I love it. Unpacked it, put a battery in it, and it worked. I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> Very good, does what it says it does. I recommended  the material isn&#x27;t too cheap and turning it on it&#x27;s simple, only one battery need it.</li>
            <li> I think this is better for men than woman, if you want it to remove nose hairs for a man, I suppose its good, for anything else, I don&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power is OK, but the angle of the top is not good for woman, if you want to get an extra hair on your chin or above your lip or eyebrows. I do not recommend it for woman. There are many better options out there for woman. I really like the Remington MPT3800SSB Smooth and Silky Precision Trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product it works exactly as it is advertised and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Broke first day on the job. Good design and appearance, wished it would of lasted...</li>
            <li> Works a little TOO well...although I blame user error!  My husband was excited to start a little Man-grooming, but he got over zealous, and now he&#x27;s waiting for the rest of his eyebrows to grow back...I recommend use under supervision, or at least be sure the user knows there are guards to prevent full on defoliation!</li>
            <li> does not work well in the nose</li>
            <li> It was broken when I opened it</li>
            <li> Better built that others, but I would still like to see a version of this that one could expect to last a long time.  Works great.</li>
            <li> As expected, so far so good. The eye brow adapter a little bit big to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> This thing sucks. It broke after one use To trim the hair after a haircut on my neck and around my ears.</li>
            <li> Switch design is not comfortable</li>
            <li> great trimmer for the $</li>
            <li> battery sucs.  am on 3rd  replacement, due to overseas travel</li>
            <li> The product is the best one of its type.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer piece has the blades recessed a little too far under the safety shield so I have to put this a little farther in my nose than makes me feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> This product works beautifully.....</li>
            <li> nice for nose trimming</li>
            <li> So far so good. No complaint in 1year.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest piece of s*** one could buy. Didn&#x27;t work from the beginning.</li>
            <li> This is the right product for us hairy guys.  Twisting it on and off (with wet hands from shaving) is probably the most difficult thing about this.  It provides a close cut and the clear plastic trimmer (not included in the picture) is the right additional part to ensure a continuous, even cut.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow trimming guard still allows for longer than desired eyebrows, but it works well enough.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works fairly well but it has a few problems.  It is very quiet and has a small vibration so it was easy to manipulate and use making this a much better choice than tiny scissors (and not as dangerous aside from the problem I&#x27;ll mention below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow combs make sure you don&#x27;t shave off your eyebrows accidently and creates a smooth look though only if you have some seriously wild and long hairs up there.  You can use the linear head to do other trimming on the brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the rotary head also heats up within one minute and that&#x27;s problematic because thats the head you put into your nose (or in your ears) and it feels very uncomfortable quickly.  The rotary head also took multiple passes to get every hair and this only increased the amount of time it had to be used and thus the heat built up further.  The linear head didn&#x27;t heat up at all when it was used but it isn&#x27;t designed for nose hairs only for other hairs such around your ears or for brows that the combs can&#x27;t lift up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally this a battery operated tool and not the kind that you recharge so you are just going to eat through batteries faster than a rechargable razor.</li>
            <li> great product, does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Works great, but I took away a star because it does not have the same &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; attachment as my old Remington.  Instead, it has the two sided blue attachment that doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Both eye brow trimmer and nose hair attachment work well.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. Nose trimmer cant even trim. Whats the point of a trimmer if it cant cut hair? Dont recommend this</li>
            <li> Update July 2015 Well, after weeks of the motor slowing down, it finally broke.  Motor spins but the blades no longer move.  I cleaned it regularly and I never dropped it.  Certainly didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected.  Original review  Cuts well but is a tad large in terms of diameter.  It is much bigger than similar products but performs that much better.  Would have given 5 if the trimmer had more than just one length</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Easily frees my nose of pesky hair with the dual action blades. It&#x27;s works, it works well and that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> This product works great!  The only thing I wish it had was a light.  Other than that, it works great!  I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this and I would definitely recommend this to any one.  Two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> This worked great until it died after three uses. Luckily it was within the 30 return window and Amazon sent a new one right away. Hope it lasts longer than the first one...</li>
            <li> It never worked. I guess I got a bad one.</li>
            <li> Saw this on the I AM ALPHA MALE video blogs, and was looking for new trimmer.  Got this and LOVE IT !!!</li>
            <li> Works great, eyebrow comb is just the right length. Hasn&#x27;t clogged and rinses easy.</li>
            <li> pool quality,not worth it</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. Great tool!</li>
            <li> Initially this trimmer worked well but after a few weeks of light use it would not work only intermittently and finally it will not work at all.  The battery has been changed as well as the heads have been interchanged but it will not work at all.  It is an inexpensive product so I guess, in this case, I got caught with a poor quality product.</li>
            <li> No pouch provided to store/carry the shaver.</li>
            <li> It worked out great with some hair problems here and there. can trim your nose and ears up a bit after getting this, mostly nose. It has been working fine but it would have been great with batteries included.</li>
            <li> This works as promised. It seems like a nice design -- nice weight and shape. It&#x27;s waterproof and multifunctional. I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before, so I can&#x27;t compare to other brands.</li>
            <li> great product for the price</li>
            <li> It quit working just after the return time was up.</li>
            <li> For some reason I just don&#x27;t like this thing. I had another one that had the regular clipper thingy like the larger buzzers but smaller (don&#x27;t know how else to describe it) and I liked that a lot, but then I dropped it and it broke... this thing is just awkward for me to use, I generally use a groomer to trim my sideburns up around my ears, the regular Remington Microscreen triple foil has the trimmer pop up and that works fine as do regular small buzzer groomers... this thing just doesn&#x27;t work well, it doesn&#x27;t trim well either... it goes in the drawer and I&#x27;ll buy another regular buzzer groomer.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t trim properly , pulls out nose hairs!</li>
            <li> Worked twice.  Then never turned on again, even with a fresh battery.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m fair-skinned and Caucasian, I&#x27;ve never been a hairy person, so I definitely don&#x27;t need this for my nose or ears. LOL But I wanted to try it on my eyebrows, even though they are not thick, either. It works for what I need it for. I also like the easy washout feature that allows me to rinse it in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I do have a friend who tends to get nose hairs that are a bit unsightly, so I loaned it to him. A gentle reminder... Yes? :-) He loves this product and says it works better than any he&#x27;s tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 20, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Author of \\&quot;Six Pack\\&quot; series (co-author Barbara Watkins)</li>
            <li> heads stopped working within a few uses</li>
            <li> work good&lt;br /&gt;hope it recharge able</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Worked for approximately 2.5 times. Now it barely turns on and it didn&#x27;t even do that great of a job when it was actually working. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Worked one time and quit.  Tried several new batteries to no avail.  Seems like it should be a quality product under the Remington name, but it is not.</li>
            <li> Excellent product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! A rechargeable battery would&#x27;ve been an excellent addition. But for the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 9 months, then just stopped working. I took good care of it too and kept it clean and dry. So, not sure why it just broke on me.</li>
            <li> This trimmer started off strong with a rubber grommet to seal out corrosion from moister on the motors; the downfall of many other trimmers I&#x27;ve had. It has an awkward trimming head which made it hard to trim the hair on the edge and around of my ears. As an eyebrow trimmer, the awkward head/attachment made it so you had to work at it to keep the brows an even length and get all the stragglers. There is only one bright light here that the nose hair trimmer it worked well. Its only been four months and the head of the trimmer snapped off. What a piece of junk. The other trimmer I reviewed &amp;#34;Remington Dual Blade Detail Trimmer Eyebrows Nose Ear Sideburns MPT-3400C&amp;#34; despite its issue with rust, was a better model since at least it didn&#x27;t break. It just needs to be kept away from moister.</li>
            <li> I should have bought this one in the first place, rather than the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;The unit as pictured is with the eyebrow trimmer attached, the nose/ear hair attachment is the standard rounded tip.&lt;br /&gt;There are no problems with snagging or &amp;#34;nipping&amp;#34; and the eyebrow attachment is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the on/off function was a bit more obvious and an easier &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; turn.  It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; to use, but you have to be pretty deliberate about it.  For example, I tried to turn it on after putting lotion on my arms and it took a fair bit more effort.  Not to mention, if not careful you&#x27;ll end up opening the battery compartment rather than turning on the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I would re-buy this unit without any second thoughts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove nose hair as well as some other ones I have had.</li>
            <li> i got this trimmer for my father and I got to see him couple of months after receiving it, unfortunately it never worked. I tried different kinds of battery but no luck!! that only shows how bad the quality is !</li>
            <li> Use it mainly for eye brows between haircuts, perfect every time, Just snap on eyebrow comb, one swipe left and one swipe right done. Nose and Ear clippers also work well. Use it once a week. Just beware AA battery is NOT included.</li>
            <li> Great little battery-powered nose-hair trimmer. Light and compact and portable.</li>
            <li> I wish they would let me buy just the clear plastic eyebrow attachment, but it does work well</li>
            <li> Works fine. Seems to be well built</li>
            <li> It takes some practice but this product works well once you figure out how to use it on bushy eyebrows</li>
            <li> Works fairly well, but only lasted about 6 uses before it stopped powering on. Swapped batteries and still nothing. At this price I&#x27;d have hoped to get maybe a year out of it. Guess I&#x27;ll have to live with a few months.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow attachment scrapes and does not effectively trim.</li>
            <li> works great, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Convenient product for grooming.  If you hate nose/ear hair as I do this&lt;br /&gt;is a good tool to remove them.  If you care about your appearance this&lt;br /&gt;item is a must.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work. I changed the batteries several times but I think I may have got a lemon.</li>
            <li> It does what it supposed to do</li>
            <li> Worked great dropped it once broken</li>
            <li> not so easy to use, the &#x27;blades&#x27; are weird and short, and ineffective. i wouldn&#x27;t buy it. i promise you, its bad.</li>
            <li> Kind of difficult to cut above my ears because the head is so small.</li>
            <li> Good for nose but don&#x27;t plan o use it on eyebrows, it doesn&#x27;t get a close enough shave!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. The nose trimmer attachment worked well, but everything else was a disappointment especially the main trimmer attachment. The double blade trimmer is poorly designed making it difficult to see where the blades are. I also experienced several cuts from the trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li> Cheap chinese junk!! No stars!!</li>
            <li> Came broken. Took it out of the box the whole head came off, thought it was normal, tried putting it back on, looked it up was broken.</li>
            <li> This broke after a month.</li>
            <li> When it doesn&#x27;t die it&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ve had to return this multiple times because they die after about 2 months of use. Amazon&#x27;s customer service is excellent and must know it&#x27;s a problem. I submitted my issue and they immediately just mailed me another. When they work they work fine and I do like the comb style versus the circular style of trimmers. But the build quality of these are pretty horrible and I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Kinda cheap quality but it works and hasnt broken, just feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Does not trim properly..have returned it to amazon</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for Christmas 2014, as of Feb 25, 2015 it is dead.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 times.  The first time it worked.  The second time the it wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;turn on&amp;#34;. Turns out that the blades were stuck and required a water rinse to free them.  Third time, same result.  After rinsing, i proceeded to trim some facial hair and dropped it in the sink where the trimming head shattered.  To me 1 drop &#x3D; dead &#x3D; garbage.  Aside from my experience, the ergonomics are horrible as is the on/off mechanism. The double-sided trim head is at an odd angle and hard to get a close trim at certain angles in general it feels clunky in the hand. This all speaks to the poor design.  Overall i wish my wife had save whatever pittance she paid for this and spent it on coffee - it would have been a better investment.  I guess i&#x27;ll resort to the Panasonic trimmer that i hung on to because it had a better set of &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; attachments for beards etc.</li>
            <li> Garbage junk hate it don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Stopped working after couple of uses, checked battery and replaced, still doesn&#x27;t work.  Unfortunately cannot return as it is past return policy date.</li>
            <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the hair and seems to cut it just fine.</li>
