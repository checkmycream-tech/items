            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Received this as a Christmas gift from a co-worker and loved it therefore ordered more.</li>
            <li>If I order something more than once, you know it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>It is NOT waterproof, so it comes off very easily with any remover.  </li>
            <li>I love the amazing volume and length that this mascara provides.  </li>
            <li>Easy removal with eye makeup reminder, and does seem to run either!</li>
            <li>It goes on beautifully and FAST.</li>
            <li>Great mascara , my lashes look twice as long and the brush is awesome, I will be buying the full size.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great mascara!</li>
            <li>Best mascara on the market and love the smaller size option!</li>
            <li>forever to find something I love</li>
            <li>falsies is way better</li>
            <li>I LOVE Benefit products</li>
            <li>but just more of them.  </li>
            <li>Faced&#x27;s Better than Sex Mascara.</li>
            <li>Makes my eyes look a lot more noticeable, but it can be a tad clumpy/goopy while applying</li>
            <li>This product has had excellent reviews in different magazines.</li>
            <li>and I love the length this mascara gives them.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush of this mascara - the tip really is perfect for getting in tight corners and going vertical.</li>
            <li>This mascara sure does put a WINK and a SMILE on my face!</li>
            <li>not glue your lashes together, does not clump easily</li>
            <li>My lashes are so light, they can&#x27;t be seen.</li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample from sephora and tried it</li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>I am sure its a great product, if it wasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be special.</li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>It made me realize that what makes a truly good mascara may be the formula, not necessarily the brush..</li>
            <li>Love this mascara, but the trial size dries out fast.</li>
            <li>It is much like most OTC mascaras.</li>
            <li>It was easy to put on without being clumpy, and it worked well to give me more natural looking fuller and longer lashes.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and the brush is designed nicely to make sure that you can reach each little lash.  </li>
            <li>but it consistently does!</li>
            <li>but this is well worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but, in my opinion, worth the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use instead of false lashes for my wedding and it worked great!</li>
            <li>But still better than most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>No need for repeated applications, the large (huuuuuge) attention-getting lashes are created first time around.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s viciousness as it thickens slightly but also gives good length to my lashes.</li>
            <li>If I was to use this mascara on a regular basis I would buy the full size, though I really appreciate that I was able to buy a trial size to test things out.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!</li>
            <li>Id been using a different mascara and wasnt pleased</li>
            <li>Got it exactly when it said I would have it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really works!</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever added mascara to my makeup routine.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this mascara</li>
            <li>Mascaras such as Cover girl lash blast and loreal voluminous seem to have softer formulas..allowing you not only to comb through easily, but easily layer-able.</li>
            <li>I wear contact lenses, so I am very particular about my mascara flaking.  </li>
            <li>No clumps, easy application and goes on BIG.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that this flakes off nor really smudges.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>No issues with clumping or looking like you have too much mascara</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying this, too.</li>
            <li>but really?</li>
            <li>Thanks to</li>
            <li>It seems like there isn&#x27;t much product in the tube...</li>
            <li>or maybe it&#x27;s that the brush doesn&#x27;t bring much out.</li>
            <li>A first coat gives a very nice, natural look to it; adding a second coat makes it darker and more dramatic.</li>
            <li>For the first time, I have eyelashes that look natural</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Not a thick formula</li>
            <li>bc the wand is too flexible for my likes in the normal size.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve just bought the normal size.  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra price!</li>
            <li>New fav.</li>
            <li>As someone whose very sensitive to mascara</li>
            <li>The wand is a little short on the trial size, but it was good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The little tube and brush is also so compact its easy to travel with and apply.</li>
            <li>Looks natural, longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>More on the expensive side, but totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>I naturally have blonde eyelashes that are nearly invisible</li>
            <li>I have short to average lashes and this really lengthens and separates them!</li>
            <li>Buy the small size, it lasts; just as economical as drug store brand.</li>
            <li>This stuff is normally great, but the small wand makes it difficult to break up clumps.</li>

            <li> The formula is strange..</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re Real, for once I have some thick looking lashes!</li>
            <li> This mascara seemed empty.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought the small, trial version of my fave mascara to save money, but the wand is too short!</li>
            <li> Even when I went to bed with it on, it didn&#x27;t smudge like other mascara would have.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look any fuller or longer than any other mascara that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Does a terrific job lengthening my spindly thin blood lashes and in a smaller bottle it doesn&#x27;t dry out and waste.</li>
            <li> I have thin and short lashes, but after 2 coats of this mascara I have the long jet-black lashes I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li> What I do is curl my lashes, apply one coat of this, and one coat of Loreal Voluminous in Carbon black</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve applied it in the morning, then re-applied at night to go out; I always use an eye-lash curler before application, and I think if you were purchasing this anticipating a &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; effect on your lashes, you&#x27;d want to use one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great alternative to what I typically use.</li>
            <li> Lashes dry hard and you end up with &amp;#34;fly legs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I have very small, thin eyelashes, and this is the only product that gives me the look of having eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> (Im not winning any awards with my description skills here) and even some on the tip for the little, hard to reach lashes  instead of the brush like bristles.</li>
            <li> I also wish the bigger tube wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually buy at Ulta</li>
            <li> Not good at all!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> (unless you add water to make the mascara last longer, desperate times call for desperate measures!)&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> The wand was broken off and stuck in the tube when I received this.</li>
            <li> I still use it though because I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> Even after immediately applying it, I have a difficult time combing through them.</li>
            <li> Expensive compared to drugstore mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> It does make it look like I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes sometimes.</li>
            <li> Dry, flaky, horrible and non-returnable!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate mascara.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this mascara!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I thought that i had horrible, uncooperative eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Just had horrible mascara.</li>

            <li> Great mascara! I have short to average lashes and this really lengthens and separates them! Only thing is it only took a week or two for the mascara to start getting drier and a tiny bit harder to apply. I still use it though because I&#x27;m obsessed. I&#x27;ll still buy the bigger one.</li>
            <li> Still getting used to this mascara, it seems a bit clumpy to me.</li>
            <li> Dry, flaky, horrible and non-returnable!!!</li>
            <li> Why do people rave about this stuff? The formula is strange.. Even after immediately applying it, I have a difficult time combing through them. Lashes dry hard and you end up with &amp;#34;fly legs&amp;#34;. It made me realize that what makes a truly good mascara may be the formula, not necessarily the brush.. Mascaras such as Cover girl lash blast and loreal voluminous seem to have softer formulas..allowing you not only to comb through easily, but easily layer-able.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks but you have to get the travel (small) size and not the normal size bc the wand is too flexible for my likes in the normal size.</li>
            <li> I thought that i had horrible, uncooperative eyelashes. Nope. Just had horrible mascara. Don&#x27;t know how it works but it consistently does!</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought a bigger tube! I also wish the bigger tube wasn&#x27;t so expensive. Have gone back to drug store types.</li>
            <li> Never tried a better mascara!  It goes on beautifully and FAST. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my two go to mascaras. I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for about a year and I can&#x27;t see myself without it. I like it&#x27;s viciousness as it thickens slightly but also gives good length to my lashes. What I do is curl my lashes, apply one coat of this, and one coat of Loreal Voluminous in Carbon black and I&#x27;m good to go. The little tube and brush is also so compact its easy to travel with and apply. I don&#x27;t find that this flakes off nor really smudges. As someone whose very sensitive to mascara I also find this doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes red after hours of wear.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use instead of false lashes for my wedding and it worked great! It was easy to put on without being clumpy, and it worked well to give me more natural looking fuller and longer lashes. The wand is a little short on the trial size, but it was good enough for the price. If I was to use this mascara on a regular basis I would buy the full size, though I really appreciate that I was able to buy a trial size to test things out. Overall, this is a great mascara!</li>
            <li> Not any different than any other mascara</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best I have found. I especially like the brush. I have very small, thin eyelashes, and this is the only product that gives me the look of having eyelashes.  More on the expensive side, but totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, but the trial size dries out fast.</li>
            <li> Even though the container is small,the mascara works great.</li>
            <li> This mascara seemed empty. It is nothing like the one I had. A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff really works. My lashes are so light, they can&#x27;t be seen. Not now though, longer, thicker, fuller lashes, and the bonus is I don&#x27;t have to curl them anymore, once this mascara is on, it does the work for me. Easy removal with eye makeup reminder, and does seem to run either!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the applicator. Doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as my Clinique mascara. Does lift and separate lashes.</li>
            <li> Will never use another mascara. Good job Benefit! Homerun!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Best mascara on the market and love the smaller size option!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive and cheap brands of mascara and always end up with Racoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Got a trial of &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m hooked. Lashes look thicker and NO Racoon eyes. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Mascara!!!  I wear contact lenses, so I am very particular about my mascara flaking.  I love the amazing volume and length that this mascara provides.  It doesn&#x27;t flake for me at all.  The only experience I have had with smudging....is when I rub my eyes.  It is NOT waterproof, so it comes off very easily with any remover.  I actually prefer the size of these mini mascaras and their ease of application with the shorter wands.  This mascara sure does put a WINK and a SMILE on my face!</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA I HAVE USED! DOES NOT MELT OFF IN HEAT. STAYS PUT! NO FLAKING OR CLUMPING! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem the same as the one in stores...</li>
            <li> No clumps, easy application and goes on BIG.  For those who want BIG.  A wand that makes sense.  No need for repeated applications, the large (huuuuuge) attention-getting lashes are created first time around. My lashes are not glopped and clumped together. Stays on all day and through my workout. Buy the small size, it lasts; just as economical as drug store brand.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara! I like this size because it&#x27;s perfect for traveling or to just keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> My favorite Mascara! I usually buy at Ulta but some times I like to find a cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clump!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smudge! (unless you add water to make the mascara last longer, desperate times call for desperate measures!)&lt;br /&gt;and last all day!&lt;br /&gt;Took forever to find something I love and Im sticking to it!</li>
            <li> Received this as a Christmas gift from a co-worker and loved it therefore ordered more.</li>
            <li> Best Mascara I have ever used.  Will be buying it again!!!</li>
            <li> Great mascara , my lashes look twice as long and the brush is awesome, I will be buying the full size.</li>
            <li> As a longtime Lancome fan, I found this mascara comparable to it. It applies smoothly and the brush is designed nicely to make sure that you can reach each little lash.  A first coat gives a very nice, natural look to it; adding a second coat makes it darker and more dramatic. No issues with clumping or looking like you have too much mascara on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve applied it in the morning, then re-applied at night to go out; I always use an eye-lash curler before application, and I think if you were purchasing this anticipating a &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; effect on your lashes, you&#x27;d want to use one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great alternative to what I typically use.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Not good at all!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;MAYBELLINE  falsies is way better</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be special. It is much like most OTC mascaras. I look for staying power, non flaking, and ease to remove.</li>
            <li> Try it. You&#x27;ll like it! Id been using a different mascara and wasnt pleased so I wanted to try out some others. I LOVE Benefit products so this was the next choice. I may stop here! Now, I do have to say that the price point is in the luxury lines but this is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is essentially the length of the mini bottle. It has the spikey (rubbery?) nubs (Im not winning any awards with my description skills here) and even some on the tip for the little, hard to reach lashes  instead of the brush like bristles. Not a thick formula so no clumping, no flaking no raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Curls, no clumps and lengthens, Love this product!</li>
            <li> New fav. Got it exactly when it said I would have it.</li>
            <li> The wand was broken off and stuck in the tube when I received this. I was really looking forward to trying this, too. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really works! The bristles on the brush get every lash and its long lasting</li>
            <li> Not as great as I was expecting. But still better than most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. Wears well and does add length and volume. Very nice. :)</li>
            <li> I bought the small, trial version of my fave mascara to save money, but the wand is too short! I should&#x27;ve just bought the normal size.  This stuff is normally great, but the small wand makes it difficult to break up clumps.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  For the first time, I have eyelashes that look natural but just more of them.  Even when I went to bed with it on, it didn&#x27;t smudge like other mascara would have.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints with my lil mascara. I love it!</li>
            <li> I hate mascara. I got this as a free sample from sephora and tried it and now I wear mascara. A little goes a long way. Looks natural, longer and fuller. Feels like nothing. First time I&#x27;ve ever added mascara to my makeup routine. Expensive compared to drugstore mascara but well worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have used, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey. I paid the same for this sample size I I would for a regard one at the drug store . I know this is a fancy brand but really?</li>
            <li> I like this mascara but I do prefer Too Faced&#x27;s Better than Sex Mascara. I find that the brush has rigid plastic spokes (or whatever you&#x27;d call them) that hurt my waterline on my upperlid. If it didn&#x27;t hurt to apply, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best of all worlds.  Stays put and does a great job thickening and lengthening.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, so save yourself some money by starting here.</li>
            <li> Did make my lashes look longer and fuller without clumping or flaking</li>
            <li> Thanks to They&#x27;re Real, for once I have some thick looking lashes! I love the brush of this mascara - the tip really is perfect for getting in tight corners and going vertical. I have thin and short lashes, but after 2 coats of this mascara I have the long jet-black lashes I&#x27;ve always wanted. Makes my eyes look a lot more noticeable, but it can be a tad clumpy/goopy while applying so it&#x27;s not quite perfect...but it&#x27;s close!</li>
            <li> This product has had excellent reviews in different magazines. I am sure its a great product, if it wasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for me. I&#x27;m now a pro when it comes to make up but I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Does not glue your lashes together, does not clump easily</li>
            <li> It curls &amp; lengthens and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Even can withstand swimming as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes (then it&#x27;ll start to come off). You will not be disappointed with this mascara!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this mascara I was at Ulta and asked an associate to recommend a good mascara. She said once I tried this one I would never go back. She was right! It&#x27;s so expensive but, in my opinion, worth the price. I naturally have blonde eyelashes that are nearly invisible and I love the length this mascara gives them. It does make it look like I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes sometimes. If only it was waterproof, would be perfection.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look any fuller or longer than any other mascara that I&#x27;ve tried. So I won&#x27;t be spending $23 to buy the regular size tube.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra price!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Does a terrific job lengthening my spindly thin blood lashes and in a smaller bottle it doesn&#x27;t dry out and waste.</li>
            <li> It seems like there isn&#x27;t much product in the tube... or maybe it&#x27;s that the brush doesn&#x27;t bring much out. I felt that I needed to use three coats to get some lashes (and, I am not into the Tammy Faye look at all). Considering that this is a pricey mascara, I think I will try a different brand.</li>
            <li> If I order something more than once, you know it&#x27;s good.  I have ordered and recommended this product to all my friends and family.....LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  Goes on well.  Makes long defined lashes.</li>
