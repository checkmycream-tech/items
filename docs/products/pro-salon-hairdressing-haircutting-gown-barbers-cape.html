            <li>Great Value!  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality!</li>
            <li>The cape is of very good quality, and as you might expect, has velcro to tie around the neck.  </li>
            <li>Looks good, works great!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re welcome.</li>

            <li>Great price, works great</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>It works great though, and they did not have marks on their necks from it or anything.</li>
            <li>Great gown.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>I have used this once on myself, and it is a very nice product.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s OK, at best.</li>
            <li>great product,  good quality material.  </li>
            <li>I think that this was a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Has velcro at the neck and covers good.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something that felt like a tarp, but this is surprisingly silky.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>Very nice Cape cheap price works great</li>
            <li>It keeps hair off nicely.</li>
            <li>It is made well and nice material.  </li>
            <li>Covers nicely to keep hair off clothes.</li>
            <li>thrilled by the quality and price, an excellent value, exactly what I was looking for, could not have been any better</li>
            <li>It is very cheap and basically covers one&#x27;s clothing, but the clip for the neck closure leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>Works well, it&#x27;s made well and was very cheap.</li>
            <li>so haircuts times here in AZ are not nearly so miserable.</li>
            <li>I think Velcro or a snap would be better.</li>
            <li>Stray hairs don&#x27;t stand a chance against this cape, and with my super-hero powers, the world is a better, safer place - one haircut at a time.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars for the price and for mostly working.</li>
            <li>Save your money or spend more and get something better.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of this gown, I don&#x27;t like the clasps though..</li>
            <li>but could be better.</li>
            <li>I sewed on some more velcro for better attachment and it works fine.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised on the great quality of this item.  </li>
            <li>However, the material of the cape itself is good, so that&#x27;s what really matters.</li>
            <li>but it seems like it will be easy to wash.</li>
            <li>so the hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it and shakes off easily.</li>
            <li>It took awhile to get to me, but it is long and love the fabric and works great.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>The cape is fine</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is a great gown for the price and for simple use at home.</li>
            <li>But, it was cheap, so I&#x27;ll just get another one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, but not too light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it because it was cheap, but I&#x27;ll never order this again.</li>
            <li>My wife likes the velcro which holds the gown securely in place around the neck and</li>
            <li>and she was surprised the quality was so good for the price.  </li>
            <li>The item shipped quickly and in excellent condition, it&#x27;s light weight material makes it comfortable and because it covers fully less hair on the client</li>
            <li>I love the material and the hair just slides right off.</li>
            <li>this haircutting gown is very lightweight which makes it much more comfortable to wear and easy to fasten.</li>
            <li>Works a lot better and is higher quality.</li>
            <li>The velcro is in the right place and most of the hair slides right off.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than a plastic bag and using a large towel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and it&#x27;s as good as any.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I would give this a 5 * for great quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over six feet and this cape covers me very well and the material makes it easy to clean when done.</li>
            <li>The size is fine but the velcro attachment for the neck is too large.</li>
            <li>It just struck me that nothing I&#x27;ve purchased of any worth in some time now was made at home...</li>
            <li>The price is just right for this product and is well worth it if you need one of these.</li>
            <li>Hair gets stuck on it due to static electricity and cleaning it off is more problematic than it should be.</li>
            <li>but the price is right</li>
            <li>The cut hair slides right off the cape.  </li>
            <li>The material is just right to keep hair off of your clothes and it is large enough to fit most people&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>Then, the nice surprise wore off and remembered how long this thing took to come.  </li>
            <li>For 5 bucks I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting this!</li>
            <li>I was in need of a new super hero cape, and while this isn&#x27;t your traditional cape, it does the job nicely.  </li>
            <li>Extremely well made, large, good quality fabric.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t fancy, but it is exactly what I need when I cut my client&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Fabric seems pretty sturdy and washes by hand satisfactorily.</li>
            <li>My only issue is the fastening piece on the neck, wish it was velcro because it would hold in place better.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t get hot underneath</li>
            <li>Durable, easy to wash, big size.</li>
            <li>Large.</li>
            <li>A real steal at this price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a barbers cape.</li>
            <li>and I stopped using it because it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It is better than I expected which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat the deal.  </li>
            <li>I had to remove it, add more velcro and readjust where to glue down the velcro strips on the neck line..</li>
            <li>The velcro strips were so short and set so far apart that the neck line could wrap around my waist before the velcro strips met to secure itself..</li>
            <li>Velcro seems decent, but will probably wear out prematurely.  </li>
            <li>Decent material.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I think it may work better for a small child, but for a grown man it really misses it&#x27;s mark.</li>
            <li>You will need to give it a good shake out once the hair gets perfectly dry as some will stick just a little...</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it also has the right covering in the back area to cover up to the shoulder blade area and keep hair of your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The velcro tabs to close seem not very tightly sewn on, but other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li>The length is right, but the neck is huge -- they&#x27;ve made it for a giant, or they misplaced where they put the velcro since it doesn&#x27;t fit tight around a grown man&#x27;s neck</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go all the way around the back, but it goes pretty far.  </li>
            <li>This works great for when my wife is cutting my hair at home.</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t need an expensive cape this will do and it doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap even though it was cheap</li>
            <li>Does the job but doesn&#x27;t connect very well in the back.</li>
            <li>I am 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; and this covers me completely while getting my hair cut.</li>
            <li>, I was nicely surprised when it came.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Those who have received a haircut from a professional certified barber know what I am talking about.  </li>
            <li>I recevied this item yesterday and was surprised when i opened the package.  </li>
            <li>its plastic and black, should last awhile as long as you treat it nice.</li>
            <li>As with some others, I found the back to be a bit short for home haircuts, but it works and it much better than the vinyl one I previously used (which felt like a sauna).</li>
            <li>The Velcro closing could be longer so it could be fit close to the neck for small adults and children.  </li>
            <li>It does the job, but just barely.</li>
            <li>you do light work in cutting hair, I recommend this cape; it is right on the pocket-book but also in its use.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of the clasp, and it seems pretty tight to my guys.</li>

            <li> Not only am I cloaked in darkness for my late-night super hero adventures, but it can also double as a haircutting gown, thus helping to conceal my secret identity.  </li>
            <li> I though my neck is pretty thick, but it still seems to be too slim for this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad when people who make these never try them on themselves to see if they fit.</li>
            <li> I would have bought one long ago.</li>
            <li> It took SO LONG to arrive (from China)</li>
            <li> The hook on the back doesn&#x27;t stay closed.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, item was as described.</li>
            <li> If you have the neck of the green giant it would work.</li>
            <li> Otherwise performed as expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel stiff, but it also feels like it will last a while.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this product, other that it functions.</li>
            <li> It seems to me like the metal clips would tear into the thin fabric it holds to in a short time, so I don&#x27;t see this lasting very long.</li>
            <li> One other thing -</li>
            <li> I received one that had little metal clips to use to tighten around the neck.</li>
            <li> Hair cutting cape for adult.</li>
            <li> This is too short and awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> I give frequent haircuts to my family members and had been using a stupid plastic cape that came in a clipper set.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you sweat, and yet seems tough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with that.  </li>
            <li> very thin, china made.</li>

            <li> However, capes are suppose to be that way; the person cutting the hair needs the additional area to work with the machine and razor.  </li>

            <li> The item shipped quickly and in excellent condition, it&#x27;s light weight material makes it comfortable and because it covers fully less hair on the client</li>
            <li> This is fabric not vinyl so haircuts times here in AZ are not nearly so miserable.</li>
            <li> The plastic version of this that came with my husband&#x27;s hair cutting kit was about torn  to pieces.....to the extent that I&#x27;d been putting a trash bag over him for hair cuts. If I&#x27;d know this existed earlier I would have bought one long ago. Works great!!</li>
            <li> Does the job but doesn&#x27;t connect very well in the back. The connectors are almost like 2 razor blades  but the price is right</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s OK, at best. It is very cheap and basically covers one&#x27;s clothing, but the clip for the neck closure leaves a lot to be desired. I think Velcro or a snap would be better. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again or not.</li>
            <li> I think that this was a good buy. It isn&#x27;t fancy, but it is exactly what I need when I cut my client&#x27;s hair. He likes it as well because it covers him up well.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new super hero cape, and while this isn&#x27;t your traditional cape, it does the job nicely.  Not only am I cloaked in darkness for my late-night super hero adventures, but it can also double as a haircutting gown, thus helping to conceal my secret identity.  Stray hairs don&#x27;t stand a chance against this cape, and with my super-hero powers, the world is a better, safer place - one haircut at a time.  You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li> The length is right, but the neck is huge -- they&#x27;ve made it for a giant, or they misplaced where they put the velcro since it doesn&#x27;t fit tight around a grown man&#x27;s neck</li>
            <li> The velcro strips were so short and set so far apart that the neck line could wrap around my waist before the velcro strips met to secure itself.. I had to remove it, add more velcro and readjust where to glue down the velcro strips on the neck line.. However, the material of the cape itself is good, so that&#x27;s what really matters.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but just barely. Hair gets stuck on it due to static electricity and cleaning it off is more problematic than it should be.</li>
            <li> It works great. It toies around the neck and gets the job done.  It keeps hair off nicely. Good product</li>
            <li> I was expecting a flimsy barbers gown but for the price I thought I would try it.  I was pleasantly surprised on the great quality of this item.  A family member is a hairdresser and she was surprised the quality was so good for the price.  She is suggesting getting some of these to her co-workers as backups when they teach classes.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to get to me, but it is long and love the fabric and works great.  Just what I was needing.</li>
            <li> matches description and functions well.</li>
            <li> Looks good, works great! Great Value!  I am 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; and this covers me completely while getting my hair cut.</li>
            <li> As with some others, I found the back to be a bit short for home haircuts, but it works and it much better than the vinyl one I previously used (which felt like a sauna).</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, item was as described. The velcro tabs to close seem not very tightly sewn on, but other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> The size is fine but the velcro attachment for the neck is too large. If you have the neck of the green giant it would work. I sewed on some more velcro for better attachment and it works fine. It&#x27;s sad when people who make these never try them on themselves to see if they fit. I gave it four stars for the price and for mostly working.</li>
            <li> As is described. Hair cutting cape for adult. My husband has short hair and some the shavings stick to the cape but it seems like it will be easy to wash. Has velcro at the neck and covers good.</li>
            <li> Great price, works great</li>
            <li> Very nice Cape cheap price works great, you don&#x27;t need an expensive cape this will do and it doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap even though it was cheap</li>
            <li> This works great for when my wife is cutting my hair at home.However, the back of the cape could have been longer.</li>
            <li> Does a good job. Fabric seems pretty sturdy and washes by hand satisfactorily. The Velcro closing could be longer so it could be fit close to the neck for small adults and children.  I&#x27;m just going to add a strip to the existing Velcro.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is a great gown for the price and for simple use at home.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  It doesn&#x27;t go all the way around the back, but it goes pretty far.  Velcro seems decent, but will probably wear out prematurely.  But, it was cheap, so I&#x27;ll just get another one.  One other thing - I bought this thing and forgot that I did.  It took SO LONG to arrive (from China), I was nicely surprised when it came.  Then, the nice surprise wore off and remembered how long this thing took to come.  Wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over six feet and this cape covers me very well and the material makes it easy to clean when done.</li>
            <li> I give frequent haircuts to my family members and had been using a stupid plastic cape that came in a clipper set. This is miles ahead of that! The velcro is in the right place and most of the hair slides right off.  You will need to give it a good shake out once the hair gets perfectly dry as some will stick just a little...</li>
            <li> The cape is fine but there&#x27;s no way to adjust it around the neck</li>
            <li> Extremely well made, large, good quality fabric.  A real steal at this price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a barbers cape.</li>
            <li> I though my neck is pretty thick, but it still seems to be too slim for this product. the back should have been bigger to ensure not hair will be on cloth</li>
            <li> My wife and I have gone through a couple of cuts with this, and this exceeded our expectations. It doesn&#x27;t feel stiff, but it also feels like it will last a while. I was expecting something that felt like a tarp, but this is surprisingly silky. For 5 bucks I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting this!</li>
            <li> Description says velcro closure.  Comes with two flimsy metal clips that don&#x27;t hold anything.  Save your money or spend more and get something better.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Large. Covers well. Decent material. Not thin and plasticy or heavy and plasticy. Doesn&#x27;t make you sweat, and yet seems tough.</li>
            <li> Durable, easy to wash, big size. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is too short and awkward to use.  I think it may work better for a small child, but for a grown man it really misses it&#x27;s mark. Hair gets everywhere and I stopped using it because it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! It is better than I expected which is always a plus. My only issue is the fastening piece on the neck, wish it was velcro because it would hold in place better. Other than that, I would give this a 5 * for great quality.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works well, it&#x27;s made well and was very cheap. I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and it&#x27;s as good as any.</li>
            <li> thrilled by the quality and price, an excellent value, exactly what I was looking for, could not have been any better</li>
            <li> For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat the deal.  The cape is of very good quality, and as you might expect, has velcro to tie around the neck.  It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have used this once on myself, and it is a very nice product.  The cut hair slides right off the cape.  It is much better than a plastic bag and using a large towel.  Around the neck, it is somewhat larger than neck.  However, capes are suppose to be that way; the person cutting the hair needs the additional area to work with the machine and razor.  Those who have received a haircut from a professional certified barber know what I am talking about.  Nonetheless, it also has the right covering in the back area to cover up to the shoulder blade area and keep hair of your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do light work in cutting hair, I recommend this cape; it is right on the pocket-book but also in its use.</li>
            <li> I recevied this item yesterday and was surprised when i opened the package.  It is made well and nice material.  It is such a big change over the plastic one that i started out with.  I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It just struck me that nothing I&#x27;ve purchased of any worth in some time now was made at home... Not even a barber&#x27;s cape...... Anyway, it does its job so I can can&#x27;t knock it for that and my attitude over everything seemingly being manufactured elsewhere is the sole reason for the loss of one star.  :(</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Covers nicely to keep hair off clothes.</li>
            <li> Product is as described.</li>
            <li> I received one that had little metal clips to use to tighten around the neck. I was expecting to get a velcro one, as others had said they received. It seems to me like the metal clips would tear into the thin fabric it holds to in a short time, so I don&#x27;t see this lasting very long.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this gown, I don&#x27;t like the clasps though.. you can probably replace with velcro or something.</li>
            <li> its plastic and black, should last awhile as long as you treat it nice. very thin, china made. Good price but could be better.</li>
            <li> The hook on the back doesn&#x27;t stay closed. Otherwise performed as expected.</li>
            <li> Fastens with a weird clip, would be better with velcro</li>
            <li> this haircutting gown is very lightweight which makes it much more comfortable to wear and easy to fasten. Reccommended for anyone who cuts hair.</li>
            <li> great product,  good quality material.  happier haircts</li>
            <li> I love the material and the hair just slides right off. I am not a big fan of the clasp, and it seems pretty tight to my guys. It works great though, and they did not have marks on their necks from it or anything. I have used it over a wheelchair, and it covered the majority of it. This replaced the plastic one that came with the clippers. Works a lot better and is higher quality.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this product, other that it functions. The material is just right to keep hair off of your clothes and it is large enough to fit most people&#x27;s needs. The price is just right for this product and is well worth it if you need one of these.</li>
            <li> I like the fabric of the cape.  It&#x27;s lightweight, but not too light.  The neckband is elastic.  (I didn&#x27;t realize that&#x27;s what I was getting.)  And, the clasp at the neck is a flimsy, lightweight metal hook.  I&#x27;m not impressed with that.  I&#x27;m keeping it because it was cheap, but I&#x27;ll never order this again.</li>
            <li> This Gown does its&#x27; job, keeping hair off me while getting a haircut. My wife likes the velcro which holds the gown securely in place around the neck and l like the fabric. It&#x27;s not plastic so it doesn&#x27;t get hot underneath and it&#x27;s not cloth so the hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it and shakes off easily. Great gown.</li>
