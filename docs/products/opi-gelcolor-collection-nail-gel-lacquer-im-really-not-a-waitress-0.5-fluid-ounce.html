            <li>It&#x27;s a great color for dressing up!</li>
            <li>I purchased this along with OPI&#x27;s Bubble Bath Gelcolor and am really impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>As someone mentioned before, two layers is perfect.</li>
            <li>but OPI is the best.</li>
            <li>OPI has always made the best products.</li>
            <li>I love this gel polish!!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great, wonderful, perfect, etc... perfect for work or play.</li>
            <li>Beautiful maroon color.</li>
            <li>Works great, like all opi products, beautiful color.  </li>

            <li>When i tell others that this is gel, they are stocked because its so glossy and bright.</li>

            <li>Gelish is better.</li>
            <li>so be sure you LOVE the color you&#x27;re buying.</li>
            <li>Perfect shade of red with a hint of sparkle/shimmer.  </li>
            <li>I love the OPI color</li>
            <li>I do wish their gel collection had more color choices</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that will come with time.</li>
            <li>Love the Gel colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that they started making it for gel.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Love the wearability.</li>
            <li>I just love the OPI</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a stunning color...</li>
            <li>with their UV drying light, of course!</li>
            <li>&amp;, subjectively, the opi colors appeal to me most.</li>
            <li>Gel color just works better for me in my line of work.</li>
            <li>Customer Service was fabulous!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Classic OPI color, elegant ruby red&lt;</li>
            <li>This is my favorite OPI shade</li>
            <li>Is there anyone on the planet who doesn&#x27;t love this color?</li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>This OPI color is fantastic, just the perfect shade of red!!!  </li>
            <li>I love my professional looking nails and proud that I can do it myself...</li>
            <li>I love OPI nail color, but the Gelcolor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>but it is not that easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a classic color that everybody wore and loved when it came out.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful red color.</li>
            <li>Did my nails a week and a half ago, they still look great!!  </li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>This is a great red color with just a pinch of sparkle!  </li>
            <li>That color looks kind of like a new paint job on a car.  </li>
            <li>I love the color it goes on smooth and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Great color as expected.</li>
            <li>1 coat, cure, 2nd coat, cure, top, cure... pure love!</li>
            <li>I just bought the UV light system and this was my first try.  </li>
            <li>with all opi colorgel colors, it wears like iron, looking great until it&#x27;s grown out halfway down your nail.</li>
            <li>First review ever!  </li>
            <li>Put on 4 coats: 1 clear coat, 2 color coats, 1 top coat.  </li>
            <li>In addition to the fast delivery service, I love the quality of OPI polishes and that I can get old favorite colors in the new gel formulas.  </li>
            <li>A true, vivid, bright, classic red.  </li>
            <li>I did my nails for the first time about 9 days ago.  </li>
            <li>This was always my favorite color and Opi discontinued it as a regular polish color.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite color in the regular polish and now in Gel.</li>
            <li>This was my favorite color in the regular nail color products and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this color before, so I knew what I was getting, but this was my first time using it at home.  </li>
            <li>This color is more of a flat muted ref pretty but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Looks very classy on, and it lasted the full two weeks</li>
            <li>Super shine, long wear, yet easy removal with the OPI or Sephora wraps</li>
            <li>Very pretty color red - nice blue undertone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I have ever been able to wear a red for nearly two weeks without a chip!</li>
            <li>I really like the color</li>
            <li>Because I love I&#x27;m Not Really A Waitress</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Gel is so much easier.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The only pitfall is the color choice is not as rich as gelish.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed nail tech and can not purchase this product, at such a great price, at any of the wholesale places I usually shop.</li>
            <li>This is a true red polish.  </li>
            <li>or they are fake because they always come out so beautifully with OPI.</li>
            <li>I particularly like this shade.  </li>
            <li>If that cute rodent wore a red hat, it would be this color red.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use this gel on my fingernails and I have the regular polish in the same color for my toes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend OPI Gel Lacquers...</li>
            <li>a rich, deep metallic red.</li>
            <li>It should be &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress&amp;#34;, but it was a true opi product.  </li>
            <li>The color is more orange, it&#x27;s dull.  </li>
            <li>but I really wanted to try OPI&#x27;s line since I already have a lot of their colors in regular polish.  </li>
            <li>This is a dark, candy-apple red - very much like a car finish with gloss over dark red and very fine gold glints giving an appearance of depth.</li>
            <li>It is a slightly differnt shade from the regular polish, as another lady in my office also had her nails done in the regular color while mine was the gel, but I think that I like the way mine came out better.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Red Carpet Manicure line of LED cured gel polish with decent results</li>
            <li>The color is exactly the same in the gel as it is in regular polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more pink and lighter shade than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Having used the Gelish line at Sally&#x27;s, I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth and light the nail polish is vs. the other brand which is a little thick.  </li>
            <li>It last a couple days without chipping I really like OPI products they last a long time</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It last a couple days without chipping I really like OPI products they last a long time</li>
            <li> They really last long</li>
            <li> I have always loved OPI&#x27;s polishes and I have not been disappointed with their gel line.  </li>
            <li> but it does not really match the regular polish!</li>
            <li> Long wearing and shine.  </li>
            <li> I have other brands of gel color, but nothing wears as long as opi.</li>
            <li> The only concern is it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not a waitress</li>
            <li> This color has a shimmer that was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a waitress.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to try gel polish and ordered the OPI base coat, OPI top coat and this color.  </li>
            <li> They may be costlier than the other brands but the quality truly makes the difference.</li>
            <li> It was not worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the polish but decided to try to use the RCM base &amp; top coat.  </li>
            <li> It got a pinky base so tones in with most clothes.</li>
            <li> I wanted a dark cherry...not black cherry but dark, I still like the color but still looking for what I wanted too.</li>
            <li> All other gel nailpolishes i have used, chip off after a few days.</li>
            <li> It seems a little brighter now than I remember or maybe I&#x27;ve grown out of this shade.</li>
            <li> Has a little sparkle, too.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had some bottles for a few months/years and they’re still going.</li>
            <li> The one thing bad about gel colors is that it comes in black bottles and have a slight different pigment than regular OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li> Not sure why its misnamed in the description</li>
            <li> ; and also seem really thick-- a little hard to &amp;#34;smooth over.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both Gelish n Opi, and prefer Opi since it turns hard as synthetic glass after 2min cure.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when ordering this polish, because the name is wrong in the listing.  </li>

            <li> I really like the color but it is not that easy to use.  Make sure the polish is on almost perfectly or it will not stay for two weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the best red I&#x27;ve worn. And now in gel!</li>
            <li> This is a true red polish.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, you will be pleased with this shade. I like to wear this in fall and winter. It&#x27;s a great color for dressing up!</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail color, but the Gelcolor is fantastic.  Depending on the rate of growth of my nails, I have kept this gelcolor on for 4 weeks without any signs of chipping.</li>
            <li> This is a classic color that everybody wore and loved when it came out.  It seems a little brighter now than I remember or maybe I&#x27;ve grown out of this shade.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Red Carpet Manicure line of LED cured gel polish with decent results but I really wanted to try OPI&#x27;s line since I already have a lot of their colors in regular polish.  I ordered the polish but decided to try to use the RCM base &amp; top coat.  It was a disaster.  Totally my fault for trying to save $50 but I&#x27;m posting this so no one else makes the same mistake.</li>
            <li> I bougth this brand thinking it would be better than Gelish, but sadly it wasn&#x27;t.  It was not worth what I paid for it.  Gelish is better.</li>
            <li> Beautiful red color. Did my nails a week and a half ago, they still look great!!  I would definitely recommend this color</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with OPI&#x27;s Bubble Bath Gelcolor and am really impressed with it.  Having used the Gelish line at Sally&#x27;s, I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth and light the nail polish is vs. the other brand which is a little thick.  The only concern is it&#x27;s a little pricey so be sure you LOVE the color you&#x27;re buying.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade of red with a hint of sparkle/shimmer.  Love the OPI Gel-Color!</li>
            <li> I love the OPI color I&#x27;m really not a waitress however this gel version is not even close.  The color is more orange, it&#x27;s dull.  You may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try gel polish and ordered the OPI base coat, OPI top coat and this color.  I did my nails for the first time about 9 days ago.  My nails look great.  This color reminds me of OPI&#x27;s Red, Red, Rhine which is regular polish.  I have always loved OPI&#x27;s polishes and I have not been disappointed with their gel line.  I do wish their gel collection had more color choices but I&#x27;m sure that will come with time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more pink and lighter shade than I was expecting.  I wanted a dark cherry...not black cherry but dark, I still like the color but still looking for what I wanted too.</li>
            <li> Love the Gel colors. They really last long but it does not really match the regular polish!</li>
            <li> In addition to the fast delivery service, I love the quality of OPI polishes and that I can get old favorite colors in the new gel formulas.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> This color has a shimmer that was not what I expected.  I thought it was going to be a solid matte shade, but it definitely has a shimmer to it.  If you don&#x27;t mind that look, otherwise the color is nice.  In terms of quality, OPI products are always reliable on that front.</li>
            <li> This product works like it says it will. Beautiful maroon color. I like the Opi collection in gel and non gel colors.</li>
            <li> It a great product but didn&#x27;t say anything about having to have a nail dryer for it.</li>
            <li> This was always my favorite color and Opi discontinued it as a regular polish color.  I&#x27;m so glad that they started making it for gel.</li>
            <li> The one thing bad about gel colors is that it comes in black bottles and have a slight different pigment than regular OPI nail polish. This has surpassed my expectations. I love this color and keep getting great compliments. When i tell others that this is gel, they are stocked because its so glossy and bright.</li>
            <li> OPI gel polish is a great product regardless of the color. I particularly like this shade.  Long wearing and shine.  Helps nails grow.</li>
            <li> First review ever!  Why? Because I love I&#x27;m Not Really A Waitress and I was so happy with it that I want you all to know.  I have used this color for years.  I just bought the UV light system and this was my first try.  You need to use 2 coats for perfection! 1 coat, cure, 2nd coat, cure, top, cure... pure love! Has a little sparkle, too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color in the regular polish and now in Gel. It is a slightly differnt shade from the regular polish, as another lady in my office also had her nails done in the regular color while mine was the gel, but I think that I like the way mine came out better. I do my own nails and everyone thinks I get them done at the salon or they are fake because they always come out so beautifully with OPI. As someone mentioned before, two layers is perfect. I&#x27;ll keep the regular polish for my toes, and will be using the gel for my fingernails. Also, my polish lasted for about two weeks without any problem.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love the color. Love the wearability.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly the same in the gel as it is in regular polish. Gel is so much easier.</li>
            <li> Great color as expected. Lasted over two weeks.</li>
            <li> All other gel nailpolishes i have used, chip off after a few days. OPI stayed on for 14+ days without chipping.</li>
            <li> I love the color it goes on smooth and dries fast. It last a couple days without chipping I really like OPI products they last a long time and I&#x27;ve had some bottles for a few months/years and they’re still going.</li>
            <li> I just love the OPI GelColor Nail Gel Laquer. This was my favorite color in the regular nail color products and the Lacquer did NOT dissappoint at all!!!</li>
            <li> The color of this polish seems different from the regurlar &amp;#34; I can&#x27;t believe.....,&amp;#34; and also seem really thick-- a little hard to &amp;#34;smooth over.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This color is definitely not the same as a regular OPI I&#x27;m not really a waitress.  That color looks kind of like a new paint job on a car.  This color is more of a flat muted ref pretty but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This OPI color is fantastic, just the perfect shade of red!!!  It has a great sheen to it, and just the right amount of sparkle!!!</li>
            <li> I love this gel polish!!! It&#x27;s a stunning color... a rich, deep metallic red. I have yet to be disappointed with any OPI gelcolor. (I&#x27;ve started to collect them!) It applies smoothly and easily. I&#x27;m like switching colors every week, but I kept this one on for two! It&#x27;s the first time I have ever been able to wear a red for nearly two weeks without a chip! I love my professional looking nails and proud that I can do it myself... and I&#x27;m saving TONS of money! I highly recommend OPI Gel Lacquers... with their UV drying light, of course!</li>
            <li> Put on 4 coats: 1 clear coat, 2 color coats, 1 top coat.  Peeled after 2 days.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It paints on the nails very easily and is a brilliant color. It got a pinky base so tones in with most clothes.</li>
            <li> Looks very classy on, and it lasted the full two weeks</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when ordering this polish, because the name is wrong in the listing.  It should be &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress&amp;#34;, but it was a true opi product.  Works great, like all opi products, beautiful color.  I am a licensed nail tech and can not purchase this product, at such a great price, at any of the wholesale places I usually shop.</li>
            <li> How to describe the color? It&#x27;s kinda a Mickey Mouse red. If that cute rodent wore a red hat, it would be this color red. A true, vivid, bright, classic red.  Cartoon red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all opi colorgel colors, it wears like iron, looking great until it&#x27;s grown out halfway down your nail. I have other brands of gel color, but nothing wears as long as opi. &amp;, subjectively, the opi colors appeal to me most. I also love their polishes the best. Why oh why can&#x27;t they get more of their great nail polish colors out in gelcolor faster??!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this color!  Had to have two bottles.  Gel color just works better for me in my line of work.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong withe this color gel by OPI!  Customer Service was fabulous!</li>
            <li> Good product, prompt delivery&lt;br /&gt;Classic OPI color, elegant ruby red&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a number of gel polishes but OPI is the best. Super shine, long wear, yet easy removal with the OPI or Sephora wraps</li>
            <li> OPI has always made the best products. They may be costlier than the other brands but the quality truly makes the difference. I love that I can use this gel on my fingernails and I have the regular polish in the same color for my toes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite OPI shade so I was delighted to find it in a gel. Every day I wear it I get compliments. This is a dark, candy-apple red - very much like a car finish with gloss over dark red and very fine gold glints giving an appearance of depth. The color goes with my peachy-tan color skin.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color red - nice blue undertone.  This is not an &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; red.</li>
            <li> Is there anyone on the planet who doesn&#x27;t love this color? Not sure why its misnamed in the description (hopefully I didn&#x27;t purchase a counterfeit nail polish) but it&#x27;s great, wonderful, perfect, etc... perfect for work or play.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this color before, so I knew what I was getting, but this was my first time using it at home.  I love this color and I get so many compliments on it.  I will continue to use it, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a great red color with just a pinch of sparkle!  Love it!  The packaging was great and arrived safe and sound.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a great color, and it looks fabulous as a pedicure.  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both Gelish n Opi, and prefer Opi since it turns hard as synthetic glass after 2min cure. The only pitfall is the color choice is not as rich as gelish. I will try to choose opi if I can find the color I want.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend opi to anyone picky about nail polishing!</li>
