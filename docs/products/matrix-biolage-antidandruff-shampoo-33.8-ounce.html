            <li>good stuff does the job better then most!</li>
            <li>I love the product &amp; I&#x27;m very glad to have stumbled onto it.  </li>
            <li>This product is absolutely the best antidandruff shampoo I have ever found over many years.</li>
            <li>It smells good and gets my hair really clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but effective in controlling dandruff, pleasant to use and works well as a shampoo in a variety of water types.</li>
            <li>Hope that helps :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it makes my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li>Nice clean fragrance too.</li>
            <li>(once is just fine).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Matrix Biolage product is a bit pricey, but it flat out works great.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I ordered this one through Amazon, and unlike others listed on Amazon, cannot tell the difference between this and the one I originally bought.</li>
            <li>As a woman that has dandruff and has colored hair, I cant express how happy I was to stumble across this shampoo!</li>
            <li>My barber recommended using Matrix Biolage Neutralizing shampoo to remove excess oils and get hair squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled when something finally worked.  </li>
            <li>They effectively provide relief from the constant itching and the embarrassing flaking.</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked, using this twice a week, with two washes each time has helped make a significant difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar in color yet a bit thicker than the Biolage and comes in a large handy pump bottle.</li>
            <li>Sure enough within the week this stuff worked.</li>
            <li>Works better than Head and Shoulders and others I&#x27;ve tried for dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>But it helps her scalp very must.</li>
            <li>thanks so much</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a bottle at a local salon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and leaves you hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It too is gentle and leaves you hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>unlike the normal &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>My new barber recommended I try Matrix Biolage and my dandruff</li>
            <li>Price was a little elevated due to shipping but product is good.</li>
            <li>if I scratch my head alot, but I use to have it on the first &amp; second day, scratching or no scratching.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and shiny every day.</li>
            <li>To answer Patty&#x27;s question: I honestly don&#x27;t know how it works in hard water, but it&#x27;s the only one of two Zinc Pyrithione shampoos that have ever worked for me (and I tried them all extensively over the years).</li>
            <li>It really works for dry scalp, dandruff etc.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I have to yet found an effective anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>I had used a lot of other shampoos but this one really helps control the falkiness.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent a little more time on this Amazon &amp;#34;comment&amp;#34; than usual.</li>
            <li> Pyrithione is probably the most widely used active ingredient to treat dandruff caused by Seborrheic Dermatitis on the market today.&amp;#34; Incidentally, just because a shampoo has this ingredient, doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to last for several days if you need to go that long between shampoos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shampoo that clears my dry scalp after having a relaxer.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works for my dandruff, dry &amp; itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> thanks so much and sorry it took so long to reply just goy</li>
            <li> Arrived a little early.</li>
            <li> Only problem is with cap; difficult to control amount of shampoo dispensed (seems they want you to use it up quickly).</li>
            <li> and although I have trace dandruff on the second day after shampooing (I shampoo my hair every other day)</li>
            <li> Every Day&amp;#34; (1%) is the only other one that also works for me.</li>
            <li> tried other OTC anti-dandruff shampoos, and this is the only one that works.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than grocery store brands, but it works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff, just a dry scalp &amp; I color my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dry hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended by my beautician for dry scalp!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to any one with dry scalp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 40 years brushing my shoulders &amp;</li>
            <li> After using the Biolage Scalptherapie shampoo and conditioner for a few days, my dandruff was totally gone.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not problem if you like to shampoo every day or every other day anyway.</li>
            <li> My scalp use to also feel odd when I would use other shampoos for dandruff, but not this one.  </li>
            <li> She uses it every other shampoo because it does make her hair a little oily but that is just her hair.</li>
            <li> BUT it has helped a lot and leaves my hair feeling tons softer than any other dandruff products Ive tried!</li>
            <li> I leave the shampoo on my scalp for a few minutes while I shower</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t worry about dandruff any longer, my scalp doesn&#x27;t flake and it isn&#x27;t dried out either.  </li>
            <li> Long ago when I started highlighting my poor hair</li>
            <li> One small recommendation: After using Matrix Biolage Antidandruff shampoo for a week my hair starts to become a bit oily.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what to say.</li>
            <li> I hated wearing a dark solid color suit because dandruff was always present.  </li>
            <li> No need to be afraid of discussing this topic in public either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the dandruff anymore and that frustrating oily cycle.</li>
            <li> I ordered for family member with horrible dandruff, no flakes at all and hair is very soft shiney and managable</li>
            <li> I have had prescriptions (that sadly smelled like tar and STILL didn&#x27;t work),</li>
            <li> No matter what I tried, conditioners, expensive shampoos, it persisted.</li>

            <li> This anti-dandruff shampoo works great on dandruff and smells good! unlike the normal &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tryed everything for dandruff.  I&#x27;ve spent 40 years brushing my shoulders &amp; I was thrilled when something finally worked.  I leave the shampoo on my scalp for a few minutes while I shower and although I have trace dandruff on the second day after shampooing (I shampoo my hair every other day) if I scratch my head alot, but I use to have it on the first &amp; second day, scratching or no scratching.  My scalp use to also feel odd when I would use other shampoos for dandruff, but not this one.  It doesn&#x27;t smell funky or make my scalp tingle when its on there.  I love the product &amp; I&#x27;m very glad to have stumbled onto it.  I recommend it to everyone with flakes or itchy scalp.  I also color my hair &amp; this product is great with my color.</li>
            <li> great product , prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Works great, smells good and even helps keep my psoriasis at bay.</li>
            <li> Best clarifying and helps with dandruff flaking also. Hoping to find it again and order more!</li>
            <li> To answer Patty&#x27;s question: I honestly don&#x27;t know how it works in hard water, but it&#x27;s the only one of two Zinc Pyrithione shampoos that have ever worked for me (and I tried them all extensively over the years). Fyi, &amp;#34;Zinc Pyrithione is probably the most widely used active ingredient to treat dandruff caused by Seborrheic Dermatitis on the market today.&amp;#34; Incidentally, just because a shampoo has this ingredient, doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matrix Biolage product is a bit pricey, but it flat out works great. It&#x27;s gentle and leaves you hair soft and manageable. Nice clean fragrance too. It seems to last for several days if you need to go that long between shampoos. It&#x27;s a top-shelf product. I&#x27;d give it 5 of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walleyworld&#x27;s &amp;#34;Equate Every Day&amp;#34; (1%) is the only other one that also works for me. It&#x27;s similar in color yet a bit thicker than the Biolage and comes in a large handy pump bottle. It too is gentle and leaves you hair soft and manageable. I do notice that after two days, my hair is a tad on the oily side. But that&#x27;s not problem if you like to shampoo every day or every other day anyway. Your mileage may vary.  This is what I&#x27;m currently using. I&#x27;d give it 4 of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent a little more time on this Amazon &amp;#34;comment&amp;#34; than usual. No need to be afraid of discussing this topic in public either. I&#x27;ve found that this condition seems to run in people&#x27;s families. Either of these two products are a godsend. No need to shampoo two times either (once is just fine). They effectively provide relief from the constant itching and the embarrassing flaking. For me, these two work where even prescription products were ineffective. Hope that helps :)</li>
            <li> After using the Biolage Scalptherapie shampoo and conditioner for a few days, my dandruff was totally gone.  I love the smell and how it makes my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY shampoo I use...it works no matter what..dandruff...no dandruff...amazing</li>
            <li> The product works well as it keeps the dandruff under check. I had used a lot of other shampoos but this one really helps control the falkiness. As for the seller the product arrived as promised and was packaged and shipped with care</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff since I was a kid. I have tried every drugstore product I could. But this is the only one that gets rid of it and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or my head itch. I had a 16.9 ounce bottle before I bought this big one and it lasted me 2 months. It is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter she loves it. She uses it every other shampoo because it does make her hair a little oily but that is just her hair. But it helps her scalp very must. Arrived a little early.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo for my daughter and she loved it.  We got it in Amazon for a great price!</li>
            <li> I have had dried scalp my whole life and could never find a shampoo that worked until I changed my barber.  My new barber recommended I try Matrix Biolage and my dandruff has gone away.  I hated wearing a dark solid color suit because dandruff was always present.  Now I don&#x27;t worry about dandruff any longer, my scalp doesn&#x27;t flake and it isn&#x27;t dried out either.  One small recommendation: After using Matrix Biolage Antidandruff shampoo for a week my hair starts to become a bit oily.  My barber recommended using Matrix Biolage Neutralizing shampoo to remove excess oils and get hair squeeky clean.  This has worked for me for over two years and I give this product my highest recommendation.  Try it and you&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> Good.  Keeps my hair soft and shiny every day.</li>
            <li> I have been adviced to use this shampoo as i have dandruff, by a beautician in parlour.  After using this my scalp itches like hell, and the hairfall is to the peaks.  I wonder how it is working so well on others, may be it has not suited my scalp.  I have switched back to head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Very happy to have gotten so quickly</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely the best antidandruff shampoo I have ever found over many years. It&#x27;s gentle but effective in controlling dandruff, pleasant to use and works well as a shampoo in a variety of water types.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended by my beautician for dry scalp!  I love it!  It really works for dry scalp, dandruff etc.  I recommend this to any one with dry scalp!</li>
            <li> thanks so much and sorry it took so long to reply just goy my computer back from the shop&lt;br /&gt;so thanks so much</li>
            <li> This is a great product, i have used this product before and knew what I was getting.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Before this I had tried a number of shampoos and conditioners and combinations. Nothing really worked, using this twice a week, with two washes each time has helped make a significant difference. I also condition afterward. Barber at Great Clips referred it to me, I am well pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Thank u for continuing to offer this great and effective product.</li>
            <li> Price was a little elevated due to shipping but product is good.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY shampoo I have ever found to relieve my dandruff. I have had prescriptions (that sadly smelled like tar and STILL didn&#x27;t work), tried other OTC anti-dandruff shampoos, and this is the only one that works. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shampoo that clears my dry scalp after having a relaxer. It smells good and gets my hair really clean. I recommend using the conditioner that goes with it as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years. When I can&#x27;t find it &amp; have to use something else I have a itchie scalp in 2 days. I don&#x27;t have dandruff, just a dry scalp &amp; I color my hair. It&#x27;s great with that also. I just wish it was easier to find.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dry hair. My scalp would over produce oil to compensate for the dryness causing my hair to be oily by the end of the day. I tried shampoos from the store and none of them would help. Someone told me about this shampoo and I have been hooked ever since. It works great! I don&#x27;t have the dandruff anymore and that frustrating oily cycle.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works for my dandruff, dry &amp; itchy scalp. I&#x27;ve tried everything else &amp; I always come back to this. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is the only anti-dandruff shampoo that I have found that works for all the members of my family. I have tried RX and every brand name imaginable.  It is more expensive than grocery store brands, but it works!</li>
            <li> Husband and daughter have a lot of flakiness but not after using this stuff! It&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s worked for them, they swear by it!</li>
            <li> This is the one and only product that has ever gotten rid of my dandruff. Long ago when I started highlighting my poor hair I got flakes. No matter what I tried, conditioners, expensive shampoos, it persisted. Now its gone!</li>
            <li> It says anti-dandruff on the bottle, but it doesn&#x27;t work. It hasn&#x27;t even reduced the amount dandruff. Unfortunately I have to yet found an effective anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a bottle at a local salon. They assured me that it would help with my dandruff issue where many of the others failed. Sure enough within the week this stuff worked. I ordered this one through Amazon, and unlike others listed on Amazon, cannot tell the difference between this and the one I originally bought. It works just as well, and the consistency is the same too.</li>
            <li> I ordered for family member with horrible dandruff, no flakes at all and hair is very soft shiney and managable</li>
            <li> does the job and cleans my hair and head. Not sure what to say. This was a great deal so I bought it to use.</li>
            <li> As a woman that has dandruff and has colored hair, I cant express how happy I was to stumble across this shampoo! It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of my dandruff all together BUT it has helped a lot and leaves my hair feeling tons softer than any other dandruff products Ive tried!</li>
