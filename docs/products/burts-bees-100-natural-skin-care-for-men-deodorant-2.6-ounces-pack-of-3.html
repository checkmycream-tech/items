            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an effective deodorant.</li>
            <li>This deodarant is kind of waxy.</li>
            <li>But to each their own.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>The best natural deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li>It holds up for both me and my husband and it has a great fresh scent.</li>
            <li>OK how do I put this kindly?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to try it out myself, and have been very happy so far.</li>
            <li>It has a great fragrance and stays on most of the day, even here in sweaty Florida.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees organic smells and ingregrediants are fantastic!</li>
            <li>We were expecting something better and will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li>Best deodorant that actually works by killing odor causing bacteria.</li>
            <li>The healthy choice is Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li>Good to use something natural instead of chemical, and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I have been getting rashes from many hypo allergenic deodorants.</li>
            <li>This is more for someone working at the office or not sweating at all.</li>
            <li>I had to use stain remover and wash more than once on my all cotton organic polo shirts to remove the stain.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product....</li>
            <li>Had to throw one shirt away, was able to salvage one &amp; the others</li>
            <li>Oh I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because it is oily and could use some work but better than the alternatives that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li>I hope Burt&#x27;s can come up with something better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this deoderant and my husband likes it too.</li>
            <li>I wish they did though, one with a more feminine scent.</li>
            <li>so I broke out the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s one more time.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees men&#x27;s deodorant for years so was glad I found it on Amazon after moving.  </li>
            <li>My boys are all happy to use it and it does a good job on teenage stink.  </li>
            <li>We husband uses the spray version, but the boys prefer the stick, and it&#x27;s more portable.</li>
            <li>Ruined my favorite shirt.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH IT!!</li>
            <li>This deodorant works very well, and it has a pleasant somewhat spicy smell.  </li>
            <li>It really gets into the clothing and isn&#x27;t particularly pleasant to apply.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like it go ahead and try Tom&#x27;s or Arm and hammer natural lol.</li>
            <li>All said and done I&#x27;m happy with the product but be careful if you are wearing a nice shirt with no undershirt...</li>
            <li>The strong scent stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t stop working.</li>
            <li>At first I really liked this deodorant.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>were just undershirts so fortunately it didn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>they are clean n fresh and good as new...  </li>
            <li>Unique fragrance, but not bad.</li>
            <li>Glad to get a decent price!</li>
            <li>Here is the full body of the response I received to my complaint:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It also only smells good -</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>But having to do that kind of defeats the non-irritating purpose of these natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had no bad reactions to this product; I feel like my armpits are happier with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Plus the scent is a bit strong and if you put on a normal amount it can be sort of strong for some people.</li>
            <li>Excellent product with a pleasantly subtle woodsy aroma.</li>
            <li>My pregnant wife compared the smell to Trix.</li>
            <li>I really loved it for a long time 4-5 months.  </li>
            <li>So, if you enjoy sporting stained armpits, or if you are just looking for an excuse to spend your time and money at the dry cleaners, this product may be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li>It is worth noting that this is not an antiperspirant, but as long as your goal is to not have BO, this is a good solution.  </li>
            <li>The deodorant smells good but other than that after using it for a couple of weeks it has stained his shirts and does only a good cover up the first 30 minutes to an hour of putting the deodorant on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s green and the bergamot helps it smell great.  </li>
            <li>It is now the only product I use for this, and I use it to go to the gym as well as in the office with a nice shirt and tie.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>However, it is very soft, and easy to put too much on.  </li>
            <li>I keep coming back to buy this stuff because my wife and I both love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I thought Burt&#x27;s Bees might send their apologies along with a semi-condescending gesture such as a coupon towards the purchase of more of their products.  </li>
            <li>First: yes, it does stain the armpits of your shirts.</li>
            <li>Costs more than regular deodorant but does not irritate my underarms.</li>
            <li>It went on clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product when I was living in Santa Fe NM.</li>
            <li>First off, yes beeswax can stain, but unless they are putting on 100 swipes, it shouldn&#x27;t be to the degree that some are implying.</li>
            <li>It smells great (like a sweet earl grey tea, I think), but within a couple hours that smell becomes mixed with BO and for some reason the new sweetened BO smell is almost works that just BO alone.  </li>
            <li>I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and was excited to try this and get away from all the metals and chemicals in normal deodorant.  </li>
            <li>it was actually a sign from some superior power to send the item back immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my experience, this is the only all natural deodorant that actually works all day and smells very nice, almost like a perfume.</li>
            <li>but it leaves stains on certain shirts.</li>
            <li>Has a great smell, its all natural, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>I only used it for workouts, which is fortunate because it stained the armpits of all my gym T-shirts before I discovered the problem.</li>
            <li>It felt very waxy and</li>
            <li>I am very upset and will contact the company.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>It really stained my clothes.</li>
            <li>This does not do much to prevent odor.  </li>
            <li>IF U APPLY TOO MUCH</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>So I really wanted to like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very sticky and sort of got everywhere.</li>
            <li>In this Climate, which is really humid</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;m buying it in bulk online because I can&#x27;t find it in store.</li>
            <li>The only one we have tried so far that does not irritate Hubby&#x27;s skin (and we&#x27;ve tried many).  </li>
            <li>But having to do that kind of defeats the \\&quot;green\\&quot; purpose of these natural deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other issues though.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was ok.</li>
            <li>I really like the natural manly scent of this deodrant better then the other&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t use it with more expensive shirts.</li>
            <li>It would work for a little while, and smelled quite nice, but after a couple of hours or any level of activity, it seemed to mix with my BO to make a much worse, more powerful smell.</li>
            <li>It works for a little bit but not for more than maybe 3 hours.  </li>
            <li>It does not last as long as the deoderant with all of the harmful chemicals of course, but it is much better for him.</li>
            <li>I have atopic dermatitis and normal antiperspirants/deodorants break me out to no end.</li>
            <li>the only downside it the price as you&#x27;re paying 3x the price compared to right guard, etc.  </li>
            <li>But I can live with this one.</li>
            <li>I put the stuff away and didn&#x27;t use it for a while...until I moved to New Orleans.</li>
            <li>Where normal gym-goers will have sweat stains that disappear as they cool off, your pitstains will stick with you until you finally are so embarrassed that you throw all of your shirts away or potentially forego leaving your house</li>
            <li>Much of those stains are most likely the toxins that have been trapped in the glands because the alum causes swelling of the sweat gland duct thereby preventing toxins from being purged through the sweat.</li>
            <li>If you wear light shirts next to skin such as gray or white, and apply to much deoderant then they will become stained.</li>
            <li>If neither of these applies to you, I suggest you steer clear of this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, we can recommend a few ways to remove any staining.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>whose parent company (Clorox) is anything but natural.  </li>
            <li>I had never used all natural deoderant before, so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Care For men Deodrant.  </li>
            <li>Here I was sweating constantly, and I found that my normal natural deodorants wore off in a couple of hours of me working as a bartender.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but I&#x27;ll soon be trying a different brand.</li>
            <li>They most likely are putting it on heavy to compensate for the initial phase of switching to a non alumilized product.</li>
            <li>I picked this up for my 7 year old son who&#x27;s starting to get some under arm odor playing sports, and was looking for a natural solution since he has a minor skin condition that reacts negatively to certain chemicals.</li>
            <li>Never buying this again, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to any of you either, unless you want to order a new pair of undershirts at the same time.</li>
            <li>IT WASTES QUICK</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and it&#x27;s very hard to find in-store.  </li>
            <li>I generally use Arm&amp;Hammer Naturals, but it contains the antimicrobial Triclosan, or Dove, but it contains some mystery ingredients as well.</li>
            <li>I like the product, only thing I would change....its soft.</li>
            <li>Apparently one of the oils does not wash out.</li>
            <li>Obviously, there is a give and take when switching to a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Or perhaps those fake wax candy teeth that are so popular around Halloween.</li>
            <li>If large dark stains under the armpits of all your shirts is the look you are going for, by all means purchase this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Like the other reviewers mentioned, it absolutely destroyed several of my shirts.</li>
            <li>A whole season of concert tshirts down the drain.</li>
            <li>You could explain to them that it is the new style, or that it&#x27;s prescribe by your doctor to help your atopic dermatitis, but you would be able to tell by their worrisome stares that you are simply a crazy beach</li>
            <li>It took me weeks to notice, but now a bunch of my t-shirts and dress shirts (anything that isn&#x27;t black) have a dark, oily black stain under the pits that does not come out in the wash, and many of these I only wore once or twice while using the deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but if you just imagine eating your Trix out of a giant bowl of aged sweat, I think you&#x27;ll get an accurate flavor profile in mind.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I really wanted to love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> But having to do that kind of defeats the non-irritating purpose of these natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had no bad reactions to this product; I feel like my armpits are happier with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Plus the scent is a bit strong and if you put on a normal amount it can be sort of strong for some people.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with a pleasantly subtle woodsy aroma.</li>
            <li> My pregnant wife compared the smell to Trix.</li>
            <li> I really loved it for a long time 4-5 months.  </li>
            <li> So, if you enjoy sporting stained armpits, or if you are just looking for an excuse to spend your time and money at the dry cleaners, this product may be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li> It is worth noting that this is not an antiperspirant, but as long as your goal is to not have BO, this is a good solution.  </li>
            <li> The deodorant smells good but other than that after using it for a couple of weeks it has stained his shirts and does only a good cover up the first 30 minutes to an hour of putting the deodorant on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s green and the bergamot helps it smell great.  </li>
            <li> It is now the only product I use for this, and I use it to go to the gym as well as in the office with a nice shirt and tie.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> However, it is very soft, and easy to put too much on.  </li>
            <li> I keep coming back to buy this stuff because my wife and I both love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I thought Burt&#x27;s Bees might send their apologies along with a semi-condescending gesture such as a coupon towards the purchase of more of their products.  </li>
            <li> First: yes, it does stain the armpits of your shirts.</li>
            <li> Costs more than regular deodorant but does not irritate my underarms.</li>
            <li> It went on clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product when I was living in Santa Fe NM.</li>
            <li> First off, yes beeswax can stain, but unless they are putting on 100 swipes, it shouldn&#x27;t be to the degree that some are implying.</li>
            <li> It smells great (like a sweet earl grey tea, I think), but within a couple hours that smell becomes mixed with BO and for some reason the new sweetened BO smell is almost works that just BO alone.  </li>
            <li> I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and was excited to try this and get away from all the metals and chemicals in normal deodorant.  </li>
            <li> it was actually a sign from some superior power to send the item back immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my experience, this is the only all natural deodorant that actually works all day and smells very nice, almost like a perfume.</li>
            <li> but it leaves stains on certain shirts.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell, its all natural, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I only used it for workouts, which is fortunate because it stained the armpits of all my gym T-shirts before I discovered the problem.</li>
            <li> It felt very waxy and</li>
            <li> I am very upset and will contact the company.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> It really stained my clothes.</li>
            <li> This does not do much to prevent odor.  </li>
            <li> IF U APPLY TOO MUCH</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> I really did.</li>
            <li> So I really wanted to like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sticky and sort of got everywhere.</li>
            <li> In this Climate, which is really humid</li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;m buying it in bulk online because I can&#x27;t find it in store.</li>
            <li> The only one we have tried so far that does not irritate Hubby&#x27;s skin (and we&#x27;ve tried many).  </li>
            <li> But having to do that kind of defeats the \\&quot;green\\&quot; purpose of these natural deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other issues though.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was ok.</li>
            <li> I really like the natural manly scent of this deodrant better then the other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t use it with more expensive shirts.</li>
            <li> It would work for a little while, and smelled quite nice, but after a couple of hours or any level of activity, it seemed to mix with my BO to make a much worse, more powerful smell.</li>
            <li> It works for a little bit but not for more than maybe 3 hours.  </li>
            <li> It does not last as long as the deoderant with all of the harmful chemicals of course, but it is much better for him.</li>
            <li> I have atopic dermatitis and normal antiperspirants/deodorants break me out to no end.</li>
            <li> the only downside it the price as you&#x27;re paying 3x the price compared to right guard, etc.  </li>
            <li> But I can live with this one.</li>
            <li> I put the stuff away and didn&#x27;t use it for a while...until I moved to New Orleans.</li>
            <li> Where normal gym-goers will have sweat stains that disappear as they cool off, your pitstains will stick with you until you finally are so embarrassed that you throw all of your shirts away or potentially forego leaving your house</li>
            <li> Much of those stains are most likely the toxins that have been trapped in the glands because the alum causes swelling of the sweat gland duct thereby preventing toxins from being purged through the sweat.</li>
            <li> If you wear light shirts next to skin such as gray or white, and apply to much deoderant then they will become stained.</li>
            <li> If neither of these applies to you, I suggest you steer clear of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, we can recommend a few ways to remove any staining.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> whose parent company (Clorox) is anything but natural.  </li>
            <li> I had never used all natural deoderant before, so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Care For men Deodrant.  </li>
            <li> Here I was sweating constantly, and I found that my normal natural deodorants wore off in a couple of hours of me working as a bartender.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but I&#x27;ll soon be trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> They most likely are putting it on heavy to compensate for the initial phase of switching to a non alumilized product.</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my 7 year old son who&#x27;s starting to get some under arm odor playing sports, and was looking for a natural solution since he has a minor skin condition that reacts negatively to certain chemicals.</li>
            <li> Never buying this again, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to any of you either, unless you want to order a new pair of undershirts at the same time.</li>
            <li> IT WASTES QUICK</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and it&#x27;s very hard to find in-store.  </li>
            <li> I generally use Arm&amp;Hammer Naturals, but it contains the antimicrobial Triclosan, or Dove, but it contains some mystery ingredients as well.</li>
            <li> I like the product, only thing I would change....its soft.</li>
            <li> Apparently one of the oils does not wash out.</li>
            <li> Obviously, there is a give and take when switching to a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Or perhaps those fake wax candy teeth that are so popular around Halloween.</li>
            <li> If large dark stains under the armpits of all your shirts is the look you are going for, by all means purchase this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers mentioned, it absolutely destroyed several of my shirts.</li>
            <li> A whole season of concert tshirts down the drain.</li>
            <li> You could explain to them that it is the new style, or that it&#x27;s prescribe by your doctor to help your atopic dermatitis, but you would be able to tell by their worrisome stares that you are simply a crazy beach</li>
            <li> It took me weeks to notice, but now a bunch of my t-shirts and dress shirts (anything that isn&#x27;t black) have a dark, oily black stain under the pits that does not come out in the wash, and many of these I only wore once or twice while using the deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but if you just imagine eating your Trix out of a giant bowl of aged sweat, I think you&#x27;ll get an accurate flavor profile in mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply dishwashing liquid directly to stain on wet clothing and let it sit for at least an hour, then wash as usual, before drying check to make sure the stain is removed.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good idea to wear light t-shirts as there is the possibility of stains (as with any other brand)</li>
            <li> Soak clothing in hot water with dishwashing liquid detergent for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li> Consider how strange people will look at you with your underarms covered in giant patches of wax.</li>
            <li> I mean, you could live nowhere near a beach</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cureious about the garments that others cmaim this product has stained because I have not had a single white T shirt stain and those would get the brunt of the work out since my pits are warmer</li>
            <li> However it ruined a couple of my favorite shirts because of the oil used in the ingredients which was really, really disappointing.</li>
            <li> yet if I decided not to reapply, it&#x27;s effectiveness was minimal if not completely absent after mid-day the next day.</li>
            <li> I found that the waxy nature of it really coated too thickly when applied</li>
            <li> Assume you actually do something other than sit in front of your computer all day.</li>
            <li> Try an \\&quot;oxygen cleaner\\&quot; or dry cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really bummed that this was such a poor experience.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to smell for the second half of all of my shifts</li>
            <li> Very dry place.</li>
            <li> melted a little, but looking back</li>
            <li> Too bad because the product itself has a lovely odor but does nothing for B.O.</li>
            <li> They now look wet stained.</li>
            <li> I even wear it everyday, where I use to avoid regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> Bottom line won&#x27;t  last but a few hours.</li>
            <li> I firmly believe that this substance actually makes your sweat rancid as it coats your sweat glands and traps the sweat</li>
            <li> tried all of their suggestions other than the dry cleaning--none of them removed the dark stains.  </li>
            <li> It did not damage or mark my clothes, and there is very little residual smell left on the garment.  </li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> I just throw my tshirts in with my other whits and wash them with bleach and detergent and BAM...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with BO with any other deodorants/antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> But even when other sticks don&#x27;t contain a chemical antiperspirant they come up with some other way (Triclosan) to defeat odor.</li>
            <li> Second, it actually made me smell worse.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed the stains on my shirts that others have noted, but even if it did leave a stain (which is expected), it shouldnt be too cumbersome given that the area will be mostly hidden.</li>
            <li> I love other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and it&#x27;s very disappointing  how ineffective this product is.</li>
            <li> It turns in to an impossible to clean grease which will coat your shirts as your body temperature rises.</li>
            <li> The deodorant ruins all of your shirts and will not come out.  </li>
            <li> you would find running down the side of a candle.</li>
            <li> I am not generally one to write in complaint to a company.  </li>
            <li> I have also had instances when I will be doing a heavy activity, and still protects me from getting smelly; other times, I will need to reapply.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell (heavy on the patchouli)</li>
            <li> I stunk after a few hours.</li>
            <li> The oily stains left behind were not acceptable and I should have returned this product.  </li>
            <li> even bouth a few for a couple friends who also like it now.</li>
            <li> JUST NOTE GOES ON HEAVY ND</li>
            <li> but they are missing some incite on what they are experiencing.</li>
            <li> Sticky and only seemed to make me smell worse than if I didn&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> The deoderant is gooey and messy, and feels that way when applied to the underarm.</li>
            <li> This is why the first few weeks on a natural are the worst.</li>
            <li> However, I usually wear an undershirt so its not a huge deal.  </li>
            <li> This product is good and all the bad whiny reviews are annoying it has not stained anything</li>
            <li> and then it was near impossible to get off of my skin in the shower</li>
            <li> Within just a few hours of showering, the sweet smell of Trix had morphed into the somewhat awful smell of Sweaty Trix.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s all natural, but I smell bad when I wake up in the morning after putting it on at night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure but that this stuff makes me smell even worse.</li>
            <li> approximately two weeks i found it did not work at all on me.</li>
            <li> I like other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but find their deodorant product to be totally, worthlessly ineffective.</li>
            <li> I was wrong; they were fully condescending.  </li>
            <li> I tried different stain treatments and while I got rid of the worst of the stains</li>
            <li> Also, it smells a bit weird.</li>
            <li> You think the deodorant is expensive, wait until you consider the cost of replacing your</li>
            <li> Sorry that I purchased this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Your body can finally get rid of some nasty stuff easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sad I bought a six pack</li>
            <li> We are very sorry to hear our Burt&#x27;s Bees Mens Deodorant stained your clothing.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> and I have no problem with bad smells.  </li>
            <li> Worst deodorant!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this stuff - awful.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees organic smells and ingregrediants are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and it doesn&#x27;t work very well. The deodorant smells good but other than that after using it for a couple of weeks it has stained his shirts and does only a good cover up the first 30 minutes to an hour of putting the deodorant on. We were expecting something better and will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I liked it and i like the scent but the wax in this product ruined the armpits of all my shirts. They now look wet stained. A whole season of concert tshirts down the drain.</li>
            <li> I like the product, only thing I would change....its soft. I had to keep it in the refrigerator to harden it up.</li>
            <li> Worst deodorant! It will leave all your shirts stained. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works very well, and it has a pleasant somewhat spicy smell.  It did not damage or mark my clothes, and there is very little residual smell left on the garment.  It is worth noting that this is not an antiperspirant, but as long as your goal is to not have BO, this is a good solution.  It is now the only product I use for this, and I use it to go to the gym as well as in the office with a nice shirt and tie.</li>
            <li> It has a great fragrance and stays on most of the day, even here in sweaty Florida.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to buy this stuff because my wife and I both love the smell of it. It makes me smell like a forest!</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant for my husband because I loved the fragrance of this line of products. For weeks I raved about how delicious he smelled. Then, he showed me his shirts. The deodorant stained his shirts and ruined them for wear. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Great but it leaves stains on certain shirts.</li>
            <li> I started wearing this because I loved the smell and am trying limit the amount of chemicals I put on my skin.  I really loved it for a long time 4-5 months.  However recently I am starting to notice that my armpits in my shirts are stained.  So I am going to stop.  I think I am going to try Tom&#x27;s next.</li>
            <li> I like the smell (heavy on the patchouli) and it&#x27;s an effective deodorant. I only used it for workouts, which is fortunate because it stained the armpits of all my gym T-shirts before I discovered the problem. Glad I didn&#x27;t use it with more expensive shirts. Apparently one of the oils does not wash out. Too bad. Otherwise it works well.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell, its all natural, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.  I put some on at 7AM, by 11:30 it was starting to wear off.  Also, I found myself needing to twist the knob at the bottom every couple days because it kept running low.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant that actually works by killing odor causing bacteria. Do yourself a favor and stop using aluminum zirconium. The healthy choice is Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> Perfect for men and women. Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Works as a deodorant should.  The only one we have tried so far that does not irritate Hubby&#x27;s skin (and we&#x27;ve tried many).  However, it is very soft, and easy to put too much on.  Laundry becomes MUCH more difficult if that happens, as it likes to stay in fabrics.</li>
            <li> If large dark stains under the armpits of all your shirts is the look you are going for, by all means purchase this deodorant.  I purchased it for my teenage son, and now his back-to-school shirts all need to be replaced.  I am not generally one to write in complaint to a company.  However considering the money I had lost on this overpriced product, the ruined shirts, and the multiple stain removers I subsequently purchased, I wanted to communicate my frustration.  I thought Burt&#x27;s Bees might send their apologies along with a semi-condescending gesture such as a coupon towards the purchase of more of their products.  I was wrong; they were fully condescending.  Here is the full body of the response I received to my complaint:&lt;br /&gt;  \\&quot;Thank you for contacting us. We are very sorry to hear our Burt&#x27;s Bees Mens Deodorant stained your clothing. Fortunately, we can recommend a few ways to remove any staining.&lt;br /&gt;1. Soak clothing in hot water with dishwashing liquid detergent for at least 1 hour. Repeat if necessary until the stain is removed.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply dishwashing liquid directly to stain on wet clothing and let it sit for at least an hour, then wash as usual, before drying check to make sure the stain is removed.&lt;br /&gt;3. Try an \\&quot;oxygen cleaner\\&quot; or dry cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your continued loyalty to Burt&#x27;s Bees and please do not hesitate to contact us in the future. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried all of their suggestions other than the dry cleaning--none of them removed the dark stains.  So, if you enjoy sporting stained armpits, or if you are just looking for an excuse to spend your time and money at the dry cleaners, this product may be perfect for you.  Or perhaps you like having your money go towards a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product from the Burt&#x27;s Bees brand whose parent company (Clorox) is anything but natural.  If neither of these applies to you, I suggest you steer clear of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> This product was somewhat of a test to see how well it worked. I had never used all natural deoderant before, so I thought I would give it a try. It does work and has a pleasant smell to it. The only problem I have with this product is its oily. If you wear light shirts next to skin such as gray or white, and apply to much deoderant then they will become stained. Other than that it was ok.</li>
            <li> At first I really liked this deodorant. Good to use something natural instead of chemical, and it smells good. However it ruined a couple of my favorite shirts because of the oil used in the ingredients which was really, really disappointing. I tried different stain treatments and while I got rid of the worst of the stains the patches are still visible.</li>
            <li> First: yes, it does stain the armpits of your shirts. I have several shirts that can attest to that. Second, it actually made me smell worse. It would work for a little while, and smelled quite nice, but after a couple of hours or any level of activity, it seemed to mix with my BO to make a much worse, more powerful smell. I now use Arm and Hammer Naturals or Essentials or whatever, and it smells great all day.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find an aluminum-free deodorant. I love other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and it&#x27;s very disappointing  how ineffective this product is. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I stunk after a few hours. Too bad because the product itself has a lovely odor but does nothing for B.O.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant because I stopped using antiperspirants because they ruin my shirts.  I used this product four times and ruined four shirts!  It felt very waxy and the stains on my shirts looked like melted candles. I am very upset and will contact the company.</li>
            <li> The best natural deodorant on the market. It holds up for both me and my husband and it has a great fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This deodarant is kind of waxy. It really gets into the clothing and isn&#x27;t particularly pleasant to apply. Also, it smells a bit weird.</li>
            <li> I have been getting rashes from many hypo allergenic deodorants. This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t bother me. Smells greats.</li>
            <li> This deodorant worked wonders for someone who perspires a lot and needs a good smelling deodorant.  It worked very well.</li>
            <li> The deodorant ruins all of your shirts and will not come out.  Do not buy this stuff - awful.  It also only smells good - does not actually help prevent you from smelling while working out.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause a rash. Excellent product with a pleasantly subtle woodsy aroma.</li>
            <li> It really stained my clothes.</li>
            <li> Leaves stains on my shirt</li>
            <li> In my experience, this is the only all natural deodorant that actually works all day and smells very nice, almost like a perfume.</li>
            <li> Costs more than regular deodorant but does not irritate my underarms. Smells nice too! I even wear it everyday, where I use to avoid regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> Had to apply several times a day to get some result and approximately two weeks i found it did not work at all on me. I want to put out that if you are an athlete or getting this product for some activity at all is not going to work. This is more for someone working at the office or not sweating at all. Also you will need to take one with you at all times.</li>
            <li> It works but too perfumie.</li>
            <li> It works for a little bit but not for more than maybe 3 hours.  I like that it&#x27;s all natural, but I smell bad when I wake up in the morning after putting it on at night.  I&#x27;ll stick with Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; product.  It does stain my husband&#x27;s shirts.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers mentioned, it absolutely destroyed several of my shirts. Will never use this garbage again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this deodorant.  It&#x27;s green and the bergamot helps it smell great.  The oily stains left behind were not acceptable and I should have returned this product.  I had to use stain remover and wash more than once on my all cotton organic polo shirts to remove the stain.  No thanks!</li>
            <li> This did NOT stain ANY of my Tea Shirts.  I have to wear a suit every day for work.  I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Care For men Deodrant.  It smells great and I have no problem with bad smells.  I really like the natural manly scent of this deodrant better then the other&#x27;s i&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m cureious about the garments that others cmaim this product has stained because I have not had a single white T shirt stain and those would get the brunt of the work out since my pits are warmer wehn i have to wear the deodrant covered by a tshirt and then covered b a dress shirt that is again covered by a suit.  and then in winter even an outer jacket.  NO problems with staining.  I just throw my tshirts in with my other whits and wash them with bleach and detergent and BAM... they are clean n fresh and good as new...  LOVE this product.... even bouth a few for a couple friends who also like it now.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> This does not do much to prevent odor.  I had high hopes, but I&#x27;ll soon be trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SCENT AND WELL WORTH IT!! YOU WONT REGRET TGIS PRODUCT JUST NOTE GOES ON HEAVY ND IF U APPLY TOO MUCH IT WASTES QUICK</li>
            <li> the only downside it the price as you&#x27;re paying 3x the price compared to right guard, etc.  But its all organic and smells very good for something that doesn&#x27;t have any added fragrances.</li>
            <li> This deodorant will stain your shirts!  Had to throw one shirt away, was able to salvage one &amp; the others were just undershirts so fortunately it didn&#x27;t matter.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good non-toxic deodorant that works and won&#x27;t stain your shirts Primal Pit Paste is a really good one.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it and it works great as a deodorant. Have not noticed the stains on my shirts that others have noted, but even if it did leave a stain (which is expected), it shouldnt be too cumbersome given that the area will be mostly hidden.</li>
            <li> smelled like gasoline !</li>
            <li> This product is good and all the bad whiny reviews are annoying it has not stained anything and it smells great. If you don&#x27;t like it go ahead and try Tom&#x27;s or Arm and hammer natural lol. I got the 3 pack so I&#x27;m set or awhile. Oh I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because it is oily and could use some work but better than the alternatives that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li> I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and was excited to try this and get away from all the metals and chemicals in normal deodorant.  It smells great (like a sweet earl grey tea, I think), but within a couple hours that smell becomes mixed with BO and for some reason the new sweetened BO smell is almost works that just BO alone.  I did use this for almost a month to let my body adjust, as another reviewer suggested, but the problem did not get any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem, however, is that this product will ruin your shirts.  It took me weeks to notice, but now a bunch of my t-shirts and dress shirts (anything that isn&#x27;t black) have a dark, oily black stain under the pits that does not come out in the wash, and many of these I only wore once or twice while using the deodorant.  How on earth Burt&#x27;s decided that this was an acceptable product to sell given this problem is beyond me.  You think the deodorant is expensive, wait until you consider the cost of replacing your wardrobe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really bummed that this was such a poor experience.  I hope Burt&#x27;s can come up with something better.</li>
            <li> Bottom line won&#x27;t  last but a few hours. Sorry that I purchased this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this deoderant and my husband likes it too. It does not last as long as the deoderant with all of the harmful chemicals of course, but it is much better for him. He smells great :)</li>
            <li> This waxy deoderant gets abosrbed into all your clothes on contact and builds up a embarrasing waxy stain. They should discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. I really did. I have atopic dermatitis and normal antiperspirants/deodorants break me out to no end. I generally use Arm&amp;Hammer Naturals, but it contains the antimicrobial Triclosan, or Dove, but it contains some mystery ingredients as well. So I really wanted to like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience was that when the box arrived, there was a giant grease stain soaking through it. I assumed it was just the summer heat and the sticks melted a little, but looking back it was actually a sign from some superior power to send the item back immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the deodorant, it was a rather delightful experience. It went on clear and smooth. My pregnant wife compared the smell to Trix. Yes, the cereal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t consider myself an exceptionally sweaty person. I&#x27;ve never had problems with BO with any other deodorants/antiperspirants. But even when other sticks don&#x27;t contain a chemical antiperspirant they come up with some other way (Triclosan) to defeat odor. Burt&#x27;s Bees seem to not have considered this. Within just a few hours of showering, the sweet smell of Trix had morphed into the somewhat awful smell of Sweaty Trix. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but if you just imagine eating your Trix out of a giant bowl of aged sweat, I think you&#x27;ll get an accurate flavor profile in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that were the only problem, I suppose it could be remedied. I could take 2 or 3 showers per day, of course. But having to do that kind of defeats the \\&quot;green\\&quot; purpose of these natural deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other issues though. The deodorant contains beeswax, which, after applying it, is comparable to wax you would find running down the side of a candle. Or perhaps those fake wax candy teeth that are so popular around Halloween. This is what will be coating the underside of your arm. I firmly believe that this substance actually makes your sweat rancid as it coats your sweat glands and traps the sweat inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If thatwere all, I suppose it, too, could be remedied. I could go to the hardware store and get a putty knife and literally scrape the excess wax from my underarms. But having to do that kind of defeats the non-irritating purpose of these natural deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s assume this. Assume you actually do something other than sit in front of your computer all day. What if you go to the beach? Consider how strange people will look at you with your underarms covered in giant patches of wax. You could explain to them that it is the new style, or that it&#x27;s prescribe by your doctor to help your atopic dermatitis, but you would be able to tell by their worrisome stares that you are simply a crazy beach person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That may not be a problem for some. I mean, you could live nowhere near a beach, right? You could be embarrassed to take your shirt off in public. That&#x27;s fine. Nobody can blame you there. But what if you just go outside for a walk or to the gym?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final problem: the deodorant melts. It turns in to an impossible to clean grease which will coat your shirts as your body temperature rises. Where normal gym-goers will have sweat stains that disappear as they cool off, your pitstains will stick with you until you finally are so embarrassed that you throw all of your shirts away or potentially forego leaving your house altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing,&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend buying this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I use the men&#x27;s deodorant because I don&#x27;t think BB&#x27;s makes womens. I wish they did though, one with a more feminine scent. But I can live with this one. The best chemical free deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product when I was living in Santa Fe NM. Very dry place. And it didn&#x27;t work well for me. Very sticky and sort of got everywhere. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it staining my clothing though. Plus the scent is a bit strong and if you put on a normal amount it can be sort of strong for some people. I put the stuff away and didn&#x27;t use it for a while...until I moved to New Orleans. Here I was sweating constantly, and I found that my normal natural deodorants wore off in a couple of hours of me working as a bartender. I didn&#x27;t want to smell for the second half of all of my shifts so I broke out the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s one more time. Fantastic. In this Climate, which is really humid and you sweat a lot, I find it to be perfect. The strong scent stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t stop working. And the stickiness problems I had before were put to rest by the humidity as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this stuff so much I&#x27;m buying it in bulk online because I can&#x27;t find it in store. Give it a shot. Smells amazing. But to each their own.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now.  It does leave stain marks underneath my shirts for me.  However, I usually wear an undershirt so its not a huge deal.  Obviously, there is a give and take when switching to a natural deodorant.  I have also had instances when I will be doing a heavy activity, and still protects me from getting smelly; other times, I will need to reapply.  I&#x27;ve also had no bad reactions to this product; I feel like my armpits are happier with this stuff.  All said and done I&#x27;m happy with the product but be careful if you are wearing a nice shirt with no undershirt... it will leave a mark.  PS - you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot.</li>
            <li> I like other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but find their deodorant product to be totally, worthlessly ineffective. No matter how sweet smelling or wholesome the ingredients of this deodorant may be, it&#x27;s no good if it doesn&#x27;t have the desired utility. I&#x27;m not sure but that this stuff makes me smell even worse.</li>
            <li> I do like the product but wish they had a different applicator.  I found that the waxy nature of it really coated too thickly when applied and then it was near impossible to get off of my skin in the shower yet if I decided not to reapply, it&#x27;s effectiveness was minimal if not completely absent after mid-day the next day.</li>
            <li> OK how do I put this kindly? Some people that post reviews may not be the brightest crayons in the box. Good on them for getting away from toxic deodorant but they are missing some incite on what they are experiencing. First off, yes beeswax can stain, but unless they are putting on 100 swipes, it shouldn&#x27;t be to the degree that some are implying. They most likely are putting it on heavy to compensate for the initial phase of switching to a non alumilized product. Much of those stains are most likely the toxins that have been trapped in the glands because the alum causes swelling of the sweat gland duct thereby preventing toxins from being purged through the sweat. This is why the first few weeks on a natural are the worst. Your body can finally get rid of some nasty stuff easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, the stuff works. Give it a couple of weeks and your body will balance out. You don&#x27;t have to wear a cake in your pits either.  This is about as good as you are going to get unless you make your own.</li>
            <li> Sticky and only seemed to make me smell worse than if I didn&#x27;t use it at all. Sad I bought a six pack</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees men&#x27;s deodorant for years so was glad I found it on Amazon after moving.  I find that after using this stuff for several days that it continues to work even if I skip a day.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Given that these are made of wax, be prepared for your t-shirts to get ruined. The deoderant is gooey and messy, and feels that way when applied to the underarm. All of my white t-shirts basically need to be thrown about because the wax melts into the shirt and sticks and does not come off in the laundry. Never buying this again, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to any of you either, unless you want to order a new pair of undershirts at the same time.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Unique fragrance, but not bad.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and it&#x27;s very hard to find in-store.  The smell is very nice, and not too herby.  My boys are all happy to use it and it does a good job on teenage stink.  We husband uses the spray version, but the boys prefer the stick, and it&#x27;s more portable. Glad to get a decent price!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is NOT an anti-antiperspirant so if you have a sweating problem this is not the deodorant for you. I picked this up for my 7 year old son who&#x27;s starting to get some under arm odor playing sports, and was looking for a natural solution since he has a minor skin condition that reacts negatively to certain chemicals. I&#x27;ve decided to try it out myself, and have been very happy so far. It&#x27;s not a good idea to wear light t-shirts as there is the possibility of stains (as with any other brand) but it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be spot treated.</li>
            <li> Ruined my favorite shirt. Terrible product.</li>
