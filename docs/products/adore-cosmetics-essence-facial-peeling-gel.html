            <li>(my husband was asked if he was famous, my children told that they were gorgeous)...  </li>
            <li>I stated that I do not have that kind of money.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this if you are looking for the best skin exfoliator.</li>

            <li>I noted that the sales slip also refers to the Fox Run Mall Adore store as “Top management llc”.</li>
            <li>I noted that the sales slip also refers to the Fox Run Mall Adore store as “Top management llc”.</li>
            <li>This stuff comes with a list of &amp;#34;inventive&amp;#34; ingredients that would confuse even the most savvy cosmetic scientist.</li>
            <li>I had picked up a flyer that had the home company&#x27;s contact (number and address used by many entities), called and tried to get satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely phenomenal and would recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>i dont care what they post ,its true they promotion talking nice try</li>
            <li>these products are very helpful.now its your chance to experience good quality.</li>
            <li>But if you can get them down to a price you are happy with, the products are actually really good.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, he pulled his chair right in front of mine, effectively boxing me in.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s easy to find out whether they are licensed to do business, online).</li>
            <li>I will strongly suggest to everyone.</li>
            <li>I did not read the “fine print” at the bottom of the receipt.</li>
            <li>Please note that this fine print was never discussed before I paid via my Chase Freedom Visa, nor was it pointed out to me after I was handed the sales receipt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even use these products if they were given to me for free.</li>
            <li>but whenever I call the corporate office I always get a great promotion or discount all you have to do</li>
            <li>Kind of scared after ready the reveiws.</li>
            <li>He also said that he would include the products in the damaged box for free.</li>
            <li>He also stated that I would also receive six free facials.</li>
            <li>I believed every word he said – that this advanced system would rebuild my collagen and get rid of my lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>He also said that he would include the products in the damaged box for free.</li>
            <li>He also stated that I would also receive six free facials.</li>
            <li>I believed every word he said – that this advanced system would rebuild my collagen and get rid of my lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>free.</li>
            <li>No phone number or any info is available online.</li>
            <li>Never ever fall for their tactics, the discounts and free stuff.</li>
            <li>Even offered 1 product with another free.</li>
            <li>I just started using this, so far so good.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t be willing to spend more than $30 on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I must say that is the best facial exfoliator I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li>He pointed to the receipt and listed off each product I had purchased, and the percentages off the original prices I had received.</li>
            <li>He again provided a receipt and pointed out the two products, the price I paid and the percentage off the original prices that I had received.</li>
            <li>He again provided a receipt and pointed out the two products, the price I paid and the percentage off the original prices that I had received.</li>
            <li>He further explained how pure gold benefits the skin, and that Cleopatra, “the most beautiful woman who ever lived” used pure gold on her face.</li>
            <li>My skin is aMazing I&#x27;M 65 years old</li>
            <li>mostly me saying I wouldnt pay that much for face product,</li>
            <li>He hand wrote this full refund claim.</li>
            <li>I asked if I could return the products for a full refund and was told “no”.</li>
            <li>I asked if I could return the products for a full refund and was told “no”.</li>
            <li>I was one of the lucky ones and managed to get out of the chair and walk away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, if something was so magical they wouldn&#x27;t have to do high pressure sales.</li>
            <li>and she wanted us to have a product that would help it better than Clean &amp; Clear</li>
            <li>He stated that these highly specialized stem cells came from a very rare Swiss apple, and that these stem cells penetrate all seven layers of skin and cause collagen to grow which gets rid of wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Stay away, I fell for their very agressive sales technique and apparent good deal.</li>
            <li>If you are a person who wants to use Botox, I tell you first try this product, you&#x27;ll love.</li>
            <li>He explained that the first step is the application of the “Superior Facial Thermal Mask”.</li>
            <li>had I known because I have very sensitive skin and most products</li>
            <li>had I known because I have very sensitive skin and most products</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money or feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a &amp;#34;special price&amp;#34; &amp;#34;just for you&amp;#34;  Trained con artist is all they are, the product isn&#x27;t even that great.</li>
            <li>I am not even sure it is all natural like they say because of the way my face felt like it was on fire.&lt;br</li>
            <li>people,,any one have problem with the skin after used this product?i love this product after i used it.my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really love the results from this product, my skin feels smooth and clean does not feel dry but hydrated.</li>
            <li>and i could honestly say im finally</li>
            <li>It has completely got rid of my acne problem and has made me look much younger and expressive.</li>
            <li>is right by the entrance</li>
            <li>However I got this and put it on right away</li>
            <li>He offered to try the products on the right side of my face, and I agreed.</li>
            <li>Yeah, right.</li>
            <li>the answer is right here.</li>
            <li>, the bad times are over, I love this product has returned me the confidence in myself, i feel that I look younger and more radiant, soon after first use I see very rapid changes; one more time recommend this excellent product, and encourage everyone to buy it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure and said no, he presented the dry skin exfoliating cream for free.</li>
            <li>I let the girl do her demo on me, told her I saw no difference with the tightening &amp;#34;anti wrinkle&amp;#34; stuff, and then let her do the peeling gEl on my wrist, which I again saw not much difference (I am 33 and actually have very good skin everywhere except my face) .</li>
            <li>This product gave me a fresh look to my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is better than any other available products in market.</li>
            <li>She ended up selling me a brand new jar of the peeling gel for $34 and put a huge handful of the sample lotions in my bag (this was after a 10 minute conversation,</li>
            <li>He put some “Advanced Firming Eye Serum”, followed by “Advanced Firming Eye Cream” under my left eye and then had me look in a mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very strong old rose scent that is not becoming.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend the product to everyone who is struggling with skin issues specially like acne ,fine lines,dull skin...</li>
            <li>I did not see a difference but he assured me that my right side was more “lifted” and pliable than the left side, and that the longer I left the mask on, the better it would work.</li>
            <li>My experience is very similar to many of these reviews I have read.  </li>
            <li>Maybe one day I&#x27;ll even show the before ;)</li>
            <li>It helped me with acne, and made my face look 5 years younger :)...</li>
            <li>I stated I&#x27;ve never paid more the $50 for any facial gel.</li>
            <li>religiously used the product as it was instructed and in one month my skin had become adorable...</li>
            <li>Many of my friends said i look younger</li>
            <li>He asked me if I was willing to “invest” in my face.</li>
            <li>I assumed that a reputable business would accept products back if they did not perform as described or if I had an allergic reaction, etc.</li>
            <li>The saleswoman made sure that I understood that all sales were final before I purchased any clothing.</li>
            <li>I would not have been interested in this product</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is water.  </li>
            <li>I was willing to pay this exorbitant price because I believed everything I was told by Mr. Baras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I assumed that a reputable business would accept products back if they did not perform as described or if I had an allergic reaction, etc.</li>

            <li>I was willing to pay this exorbitant price because I believed everything I was told by Mr. Baras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can buy $5 products at Walgreens with higher quality ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you buy it from a store, you will be high pressed with the aggressive sales that make a used car dealer and a time share salesman look like a mild mannered kitten.  </li>
            <li>Iresponded by stating the fine lines around my eyes was my major concern.</li>
            <li>He then wet his hands and rubbed the mask over the right side of my face, which generated more heat.</li>
            <li>I have a few of their products and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Acne has been in my life for as long as I remember and I have tried many products and spend so much money trying to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li>she made no mention of me being able to returN it and was overall very up front with me, though still trying high pressure sales.</li>
            <li>He then showed me a jar of what appeared to be large salt crystals.</li>
            <li>and I thought that I was purchasing cream containing pure gold.</li>
            <li>Therefore, Mr. Baras outright lied to me that the gold-colored balls were in fact pure gold.</li>
            <li>and I thought that I was purchasing cream containing pure gold.</li>
            <li>Therefore, Mr. Baras outright lied to me that the gold-colored balls were in fact pure gold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, very high pressured selling tactics.</li>
            <li>He then said that Adore products are “very high end” and therefore cost quite a bit of money.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t talk to these people, very high pressure...</li>
            <li>This product was amazing and cleared my acne within a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I see  really here is that people just don&#x27;t like the sales people.</li>
            <li>Run fast when you see this company.  </li>
            <li>you can get for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>If you are walking by one of their stores run fast....</li>
            <li>i really like these products, since i started using Adore products</li>
            <li>I am using Adore products and they are very helpful.</li>
            <li>and my skin returned back to being blemish free.</li>
            <li>i am very concerned about my color..</li>
            <li>i was very worried..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care so much about having to wipe it off, but just the attitude.  </li>
            <li>They are very pushy and aggressive too.</li>
            <li>He asked me if organic facial products were important to me, to which I responded “yes”.</li>
            <li>am very ashamed that I fell for this scam, and I can ill-afford $1,200.</li>
            <li>am very ashamed that I fell for this scam, and I can ill-afford $1,200.</li>
            <li>If it was a legitimate product that really did what it is supposed to do they wouldn&#x27;t have guys trying to pull you in off the street.</li>
            <li>I was told no problem when I said I had sensitive skin on returning -LIE!!!</li>
            <li>Since my teenage years, I&#x27;d been through the problem of dealing with acne and pimples on my face making me less expressive and less confident.</li>
            <li>He rubbed the product in with a white plastic spatula and while waiting for it to dry, he explained that we have seven layers of skin and most products only work on the top layer.</li>
            <li>The main feature of this product is that its very natural and its pretty much royal.</li>
            <li>I bought this product from the mall kiosk like the other two reviewers did and the salesperson, while being very pleasant and amiable, was very pushy and hard set into having me</li>
            <li>He punched in some numbers and stated that he could use his “voucher” to give me a special deal but that I could not tell a soul about the deal because he was offering it only to me.</li>
            <li>I certainly am not wealthy by any means and that kind of money is out of my reach.</li>
            <li>just fine,,not red or bump,but smooth and soft ..</li>
            <li>There were several large signs placed next to the cash registers that all sales were final.&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Baras was so professional and believable that I fell for it all – hook, line and sinker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were several large signs placed next to the cash registers that all sales were final.&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Baras was so professional and believable that I fell for it all – hook, line and sinker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moreover , their customer service personnel are very intuitive, professional , and helpful !</li>
            <li>The products are highly chemical, nothing organic about them.</li>
            <li>this product is high priced.</li>
            <li>Adore&#x27;s Facial Peeling Gel along with some other products that I&#x27;ve tried in the past and immediately became a permanent part of my skin care &amp;#34;arsenal&amp;#34; is AMAZING !!!</li>
            <li>Then I was offered hundreds of dollars of complimentary product with the purchase of a gold facial.  </li>
            <li>I was at an \\&quot;Adore Cosmetics\\&quot; store, and was told, not that I believed it, the peel normally costs $600 (the receipt says the $160 paid was a 73% discount).</li>
            <li>As Tresor Rare products are sold by the same bunch of salesmen/women, in the same aggressive manner, I would advise anyone to steer clear of Tresor Rare products too.</li>
            <li>My mom tested the product in New York and after 2 weeks contacted Tony at the Adore booth at 3663 las vegas blvd and was told to file a customer claim form.</li>
            <li>He stated that the CELLMAX products penetrate all seven layers of the skin and cause the skin to generate stem cells that form new collagen.</li>
            <li>I researched New Hampshire’s SOS website and found that there is no company registered under this name.</li>
            <li>I researched New Hampshire’s SOS website and found that there is no company registered under this name.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t produce promised or expected results any more than a $15 product from your local CVS or Walgreens, yet you can&#x27;t return it at all.</li>
            <li>I thought I was receiving a terrific deal for such technologically advanced products.</li>
            <li>After having me smell the salt, he stated that the salt crystals came from the Dead Sea and had very special properties.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I took the cover off and removed the plastic from the jar opening.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I took the cover off and removed the plastic from the jar opening.</li>
            <li>and it was becoming very dark ..</li>
            <li>There were results, the exact same results I get when I bother to use the moisturizer I have at home.  </li>
            <li>First of all they practically block your way in the local mall and</li>
            <li>(After thinking about the entire sales pitch, I believe that it was most likely the power of suggestion that caused me to think that my treated wrist looked different.)</li>
            <li>Their products are not worth a penny; now that i tried their products, i wouldn&#x27;t take them even if offered for free.</li>
            <li>He then stated that for $400 ($200 for the eye serum and $200 for the eye cream) he would add in the face cream, the facial peeling gel, the Dead See salt and the Body Butter for free – and he then added another “free” product to the pile called “Essence Facial Cleanser”.</li>
            <li>On Saturday, December 27, 2014, I was on my way out of the Fox Run Mall located in Newington, New Hampshire, when I made eye contact with a young man named Jonathan Baras.</li>
            <li>I stated that I have very sensitive skin and frequently break out in eczema.</li>
            <li>After applying the cream and another product called CELLMAX Elite Facial Serum to the right side of my face, he handed me a mirror and told me that he definitely could see a difference between the left and right sides of my face.</li>
            <li>I know that the current price of pure gold is around $1,100 an ounce</li>
            <li>I then looked at the ingredients of the CELLMAX facial cream – the one that purportedly contains balls of pure gold.</li>
            <li>I know that the current price of pure gold is around $1,100 an ounce</li>
            <li>I then looked at the ingredients of the CELLMAX facial cream – the one that purportedly contains balls of pure gold.</li>
            <li>Do not waste our money.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>so we can&#x27;t afford this, and she said that since we have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The eye area is too sensitive for this overpriced product .</li>
            <li>, my acne finally is over , thanks to Adore.</li>
            <li>I have always have acne breakouts and this does open my pores and really cleans up my face.</li>
            <li>When I start to use this product it gives my face a extra fairness.my face is becomes very shiny and brightness.</li>
            <li>This so-called “novel” technology was developed by Mibelle Biochemistry, a Swiss company that develops products for use in the cosmetic industry.  </li>
            <li>This so-called “novel” technology was developed by Mibelle Biochemistry, a Swiss company that develops products for use in the cosmetic industry.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a complete care for these acne and pimples</li>
            <li>i prefer natural products with moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Was there for at least 30 min or more.</li>
            <li>that case all you can do is complain to the FDA about suspicious practices and write an honest poor review as I&#x27;m doing here.</li>
            <li>then asked me what my major facial skin concern was, and like most middle aged women,</li>
            <li>Product 100% recommended, my face was a total mess, this product has been a real blessing, this product has helped me with my acne, my face is much cleaner, healthier, my self-esteem is very high</li>
            <li>I only purchase my products directly from the source since I love the ingredients but the prices on the website are a little over my budget personally</li>
            <li>He said that what he had placed on the table before me was a year’s supply of all the products and that Adore was having a special sale on the Dead Sea Salt and the Body Butter.</li>
            <li>I use bare escentuals for most of my makeup, and a few other high end cosmetics (guerlain, dior, to name two).</li>
            <li>He then asked me to hold out my right wrist, and he place a small amount of the product on the underside of my wrist, explaining that the facial skin was very much like the wrist skin.</li>
            <li>He at first tried to sell me a $200 bundle, then offered to give me a 50% discount voucher, but would only get half the bundle (which isn&#x27;t really a discount?</li>
            <li>I explained that I live 110 miles away from the mall, and asked if I could ship the products back.</li>
            <li>I explained that I live 110 miles away from the mall, and asked if I could ship the products back.</li>
            <li>(I later learned that the product’s main ingredient, Sodium Potassium Aluminum Silicate, produces an exothermic chemical reaction when mixed with water.</li>
            <li>I will steer clear of this store next time</li>
            <li>I would stay as far away as possible.  </li>
            <li>this is a complete product for your facial pblms .</li>
            <li>Went as far as to admire my jewelry and tell me that he wanted to get some like it for his dear mom back in Israel.</li>
            <li>Watch out San Francisco---they are planning to open a store near Union Square.</li>
            <li>The store apparently has no business license or state registration (if it does, it&#x27;s under some name not on the store/receipts).</li>
            <li>He allowed her 30 days to test the product and get a full refund if not satisfied.</li>
            <li>It did appear that in a few seconds a laugh line was lighter.</li>
            <li>Organic Innovation\\&quot; allegedly organic cleanser and moisturizer, and they were not what I experienced in store---had a horrible smell, and I would never buy anything with a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I was stonewalled;not giving up; will spend as much time as it takes, go to the store and hand my research to every potential victim before they set foot in the store, if necessary.    </li>
            <li>He showed me that the box was damaged (there was a small tear in the top layer of paper in one corner of the black box)</li>
            <li>He showed me that the box was damaged (there was a small tear in the top layer of paper in one corner of the black box)</li>
            <li>The rubbing action caused a large number of small oblong-shaped masses to appear.</li>
            <li>He scooped a small amount out of the jar and placed it in the palm of my right hand.</li>
            <li>it really does clear your acne,i was a bit skeptical at first but after using it.</li>

            <li> (my husband was asked if he was famous, my children told that they were gorgeous)...  </li>

            <li> I noted that the sales slip also refers to the Fox Run Mall Adore store as “Top management llc”.</li>
            <li> I noted that the sales slip also refers to the Fox Run Mall Adore store as “Top management llc”.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes with a list of &amp;#34;inventive&amp;#34; ingredients that would confuse even the most savvy cosmetic scientist.</li>
            <li> I had picked up a flyer that had the home company&#x27;s contact (number and address used by many entities), called and tried to get satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely phenomenal and would recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> i dont care what they post ,its true they promotion talking nice try</li>
            <li> these products are very helpful.now its your chance to experience good quality.</li>
            <li> But if you can get them down to a price you are happy with, the products are actually really good.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, he pulled his chair right in front of mine, effectively boxing me in.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s easy to find out whether they are licensed to do business, online).</li>
            <li> I will strongly suggest to everyone.</li>
            <li> I did not read the “fine print” at the bottom of the receipt.</li>
            <li> Please note that this fine print was never discussed before I paid via my Chase Freedom Visa, nor was it pointed out to me after I was handed the sales receipt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even use these products if they were given to me for free.</li>
            <li> but whenever I call the corporate office I always get a great promotion or discount all you have to do</li>
            <li> Kind of scared after ready the reveiws.</li>
            <li> He also said that he would include the products in the damaged box for free.</li>
            <li> He also stated that I would also receive six free facials.</li>
            <li> I believed every word he said – that this advanced system would rebuild my collagen and get rid of my lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> He also said that he would include the products in the damaged box for free.</li>

            <li> I believed every word he said – that this advanced system would rebuild my collagen and get rid of my lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> free.</li>
            <li> No phone number or any info is available online.</li>
            <li> Never ever fall for their tactics, the discounts and free stuff.</li>
            <li> Even offered 1 product with another free.</li>
            <li> I just started using this, so far so good.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t be willing to spend more than $30 on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I must say that is the best facial exfoliator I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> He pointed to the receipt and listed off each product I had purchased, and the percentages off the original prices I had received.</li>
            <li> He again provided a receipt and pointed out the two products, the price I paid and the percentage off the original prices that I had received.</li>
            <li> He again provided a receipt and pointed out the two products, the price I paid and the percentage off the original prices that I had received.</li>
            <li> He further explained how pure gold benefits the skin, and that Cleopatra, “the most beautiful woman who ever lived” used pure gold on her face.</li>
            <li> My skin is aMazing I&#x27;M 65 years old</li>
            <li> mostly me saying I wouldnt pay that much for face product,</li>
            <li> He hand wrote this full refund claim.</li>
            <li> I asked if I could return the products for a full refund and was told “no”.</li>
            <li> I asked if I could return the products for a full refund and was told “no”.</li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky ones and managed to get out of the chair and walk away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, if something was so magical they wouldn&#x27;t have to do high pressure sales.</li>
            <li> and she wanted us to have a product that would help it better than Clean &amp; Clear</li>
            <li> He stated that these highly specialized stem cells came from a very rare Swiss apple, and that these stem cells penetrate all seven layers of skin and cause collagen to grow which gets rid of wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Stay away, I fell for their very agressive sales technique and apparent good deal.</li>
            <li> If you are a person who wants to use Botox, I tell you first try this product, you&#x27;ll love.</li>
            <li> He explained that the first step is the application of the “Superior Facial Thermal Mask”.</li>
            <li> had I known because I have very sensitive skin and most products</li>
            <li> had I known because I have very sensitive skin and most products</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money or feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a &amp;#34;special price&amp;#34; &amp;#34;just for you&amp;#34;  Trained con artist is all they are, the product isn&#x27;t even that great.</li>
            <li> I am not even sure it is all natural like they say because of the way my face felt like it was on fire.&lt;br</li>
            <li> people,,any one have problem with the skin after used this product?i love this product after i used it.my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really love the results from this product, my skin feels smooth and clean does not feel dry but hydrated.</li>
            <li> and i could honestly say im finally</li>
            <li> It has completely got rid of my acne problem and has made me look much younger and expressive.</li>
            <li> is right by the entrance</li>
            <li> However I got this and put it on right away</li>
            <li> He offered to try the products on the right side of my face, and I agreed.</li>
            <li> Yeah, right.</li>
            <li> the answer is right here.</li>
            <li> , the bad times are over, I love this product has returned me the confidence in myself, i feel that I look younger and more radiant, soon after first use I see very rapid changes; one more time recommend this excellent product, and encourage everyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure and said no, he presented the dry skin exfoliating cream for free.</li>
            <li> I let the girl do her demo on me, told her I saw no difference with the tightening &amp;#34;anti wrinkle&amp;#34; stuff, and then let her do the peeling gEl on my wrist, which I again saw not much difference (I am 33 and actually have very good skin everywhere except my face) .</li>
            <li> This product gave me a fresh look to my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is better than any other available products in market.</li>
            <li> She ended up selling me a brand new jar of the peeling gel for $34 and put a huge handful of the sample lotions in my bag (this was after a 10 minute conversation,</li>
            <li> He put some “Advanced Firming Eye Serum”, followed by “Advanced Firming Eye Cream” under my left eye and then had me look in a mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very strong old rose scent that is not becoming.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend the product to everyone who is struggling with skin issues specially like acne ,fine lines,dull skin...</li>
            <li> I did not see a difference but he assured me that my right side was more “lifted” and pliable than the left side, and that the longer I left the mask on, the better it would work.</li>
            <li> My experience is very similar to many of these reviews I have read.  </li>
            <li> Maybe one day I&#x27;ll even show the before ;)</li>
            <li> It helped me with acne, and made my face look 5 years younger :)...</li>
            <li> I stated I&#x27;ve never paid more the $50 for any facial gel.</li>
            <li> religiously used the product as it was instructed and in one month my skin had become adorable...</li>
            <li> Many of my friends said i look younger</li>
            <li> He asked me if I was willing to “invest” in my face.</li>
            <li> I assumed that a reputable business would accept products back if they did not perform as described or if I had an allergic reaction, etc.</li>
            <li> The saleswoman made sure that I understood that all sales were final before I purchased any clothing.</li>
            <li> I would not have been interested in this product</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is water.  </li>
            <li> I was willing to pay this exorbitant price because I believed everything I was told by Mr. Baras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> You can buy $5 products at Walgreens with higher quality ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you buy it from a store, you will be high pressed with the aggressive sales that make a used car dealer and a time share salesman look like a mild mannered kitten.  </li>
            <li> Iresponded by stating the fine lines around my eyes was my major concern.</li>
            <li> He then wet his hands and rubbed the mask over the right side of my face, which generated more heat.</li>
            <li> I have a few of their products and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Acne has been in my life for as long as I remember and I have tried many products and spend so much money trying to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> she made no mention of me being able to returN it and was overall very up front with me, though still trying high pressure sales.</li>
            <li> He then showed me a jar of what appeared to be large salt crystals.</li>
            <li> and I thought that I was purchasing cream containing pure gold.</li>
            <li> Therefore, Mr. Baras outright lied to me that the gold-colored balls were in fact pure gold.</li>

            <li> Therefore, Mr. Baras outright lied to me that the gold-colored balls were in fact pure gold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, very high pressured selling tactics.</li>
            <li> He then said that Adore products are “very high end” and therefore cost quite a bit of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t talk to these people, very high pressure...</li>
            <li> This product was amazing and cleared my acne within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I see  really here is that people just don&#x27;t like the sales people.</li>
            <li> Run fast when you see this company.  </li>
            <li> you can get for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> If you are walking by one of their stores run fast....</li>
            <li> i really like these products, since i started using Adore products</li>
            <li> I am using Adore products and they are very helpful.</li>
            <li> and my skin returned back to being blemish free.</li>
            <li> i am very concerned about my color..</li>
            <li> i was very worried..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care so much about having to wipe it off, but just the attitude.  </li>
            <li> They are very pushy and aggressive too.</li>
            <li> He asked me if organic facial products were important to me, to which I responded “yes”.</li>
            <li> am very ashamed that I fell for this scam, and I can ill-afford $1,200.</li>
            <li> am very ashamed that I fell for this scam, and I can ill-afford $1,200.</li>
            <li> If it was a legitimate product that really did what it is supposed to do they wouldn&#x27;t have guys trying to pull you in off the street.</li>
            <li> I was told no problem when I said I had sensitive skin on returning -LIE!!!</li>
            <li> Since my teenage years, I&#x27;d been through the problem of dealing with acne and pimples on my face making me less expressive and less confident.</li>
            <li> He rubbed the product in with a white plastic spatula and while waiting for it to dry, he explained that we have seven layers of skin and most products only work on the top layer.</li>
            <li> The main feature of this product is that its very natural and its pretty much royal.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from the mall kiosk like the other two reviewers did and the salesperson, while being very pleasant and amiable, was very pushy and hard set into having me</li>
            <li> He punched in some numbers and stated that he could use his “voucher” to give me a special deal but that I could not tell a soul about the deal because he was offering it only to me.</li>
            <li> I certainly am not wealthy by any means and that kind of money is out of my reach.</li>
            <li> just fine,,not red or bump,but smooth and soft ..</li>
            <li> There were several large signs placed next to the cash registers that all sales were final.&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Baras was so professional and believable that I fell for it all – hook, line and sinker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were several large signs placed next to the cash registers that all sales were final.&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Baras was so professional and believable that I fell for it all – hook, line and sinker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moreover , their customer service personnel are very intuitive, professional , and helpful !</li>
            <li> The products are highly chemical, nothing organic about them.</li>
            <li> this product is high priced.</li>
            <li> Adore&#x27;s Facial Peeling Gel along with some other products that I&#x27;ve tried in the past and immediately became a permanent part of my skin care &amp;#34;arsenal&amp;#34; is AMAZING !!!</li>
            <li> Then I was offered hundreds of dollars of complimentary product with the purchase of a gold facial.  </li>
            <li> I was at an \\&quot;Adore Cosmetics\\&quot; store, and was told, not that I believed it, the peel normally costs $600 (the receipt says the $160 paid was a 73% discount).</li>
            <li> As Tresor Rare products are sold by the same bunch of salesmen/women, in the same aggressive manner, I would advise anyone to steer clear of Tresor Rare products too.</li>
            <li> My mom tested the product in New York and after 2 weeks contacted Tony at the Adore booth at 3663 las vegas blvd and was told to file a customer claim form.</li>
            <li> He stated that the CELLMAX products penetrate all seven layers of the skin and cause the skin to generate stem cells that form new collagen.</li>
            <li> I researched New Hampshire’s SOS website and found that there is no company registered under this name.</li>
            <li> I researched New Hampshire’s SOS website and found that there is no company registered under this name.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce promised or expected results any more than a $15 product from your local CVS or Walgreens, yet you can&#x27;t return it at all.</li>
            <li> I thought I was receiving a terrific deal for such technologically advanced products.</li>
            <li> After having me smell the salt, he stated that the salt crystals came from the Dead Sea and had very special properties.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I took the cover off and removed the plastic from the jar opening.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I took the cover off and removed the plastic from the jar opening.</li>
            <li> and it was becoming very dark ..</li>
            <li> There were results, the exact same results I get when I bother to use the moisturizer I have at home.  </li>
            <li> First of all they practically block your way in the local mall and</li>
            <li> (After thinking about the entire sales pitch, I believe that it was most likely the power of suggestion that caused me to think that my treated wrist looked different.)</li>
            <li> Their products are not worth a penny; now that i tried their products, i wouldn&#x27;t take them even if offered for free.</li>
            <li> He then stated that for $400 ($200 for the eye serum and $200 for the eye cream) he would add in the face cream, the facial peeling gel, the Dead See salt and the Body Butter for free – and he then added another “free” product to the pile called “Essence Facial Cleanser”.</li>
            <li> On Saturday, December 27, 2014, I was on my way out of the Fox Run Mall located in Newington, New Hampshire, when I made eye contact with a young man named Jonathan Baras.</li>
            <li> I stated that I have very sensitive skin and frequently break out in eczema.</li>
            <li> After applying the cream and another product called CELLMAX Elite Facial Serum to the right side of my face, he handed me a mirror and told me that he definitely could see a difference between the left and right sides of my face.</li>
            <li> I know that the current price of pure gold is around $1,100 an ounce</li>
            <li> I then looked at the ingredients of the CELLMAX facial cream – the one that purportedly contains balls of pure gold.</li>
            <li> I know that the current price of pure gold is around $1,100 an ounce</li>
            <li> I then looked at the ingredients of the CELLMAX facial cream – the one that purportedly contains balls of pure gold.</li>
            <li> Do not waste our money.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> so we can&#x27;t afford this, and she said that since we have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The eye area is too sensitive for this overpriced product .</li>
            <li> , my acne finally is over , thanks to Adore.</li>
            <li> I have always have acne breakouts and this does open my pores and really cleans up my face.</li>
            <li> When I start to use this product it gives my face a extra fairness.my face is becomes very shiny and brightness.</li>
            <li> This so-called “novel” technology was developed by Mibelle Biochemistry, a Swiss company that develops products for use in the cosmetic industry.  </li>
            <li> This so-called “novel” technology was developed by Mibelle Biochemistry, a Swiss company that develops products for use in the cosmetic industry.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a complete care for these acne and pimples</li>
            <li> i prefer natural products with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Was there for at least 30 min or more.</li>
            <li> that case all you can do is complain to the FDA about suspicious practices and write an honest poor review as I&#x27;m doing here.</li>
            <li> then asked me what my major facial skin concern was, and like most middle aged women,</li>
            <li> Product 100% recommended, my face was a total mess, this product has been a real blessing, this product has helped me with my acne, my face is much cleaner, healthier, my self-esteem is very high</li>
            <li> I only purchase my products directly from the source since I love the ingredients but the prices on the website are a little over my budget personally</li>
            <li> He said that what he had placed on the table before me was a year’s supply of all the products and that Adore was having a special sale on the Dead Sea Salt and the Body Butter.</li>
            <li> I use bare escentuals for most of my makeup, and a few other high end cosmetics (guerlain, dior, to name two).</li>
            <li> He then asked me to hold out my right wrist, and he place a small amount of the product on the underside of my wrist, explaining that the facial skin was very much like the wrist skin.</li>
            <li> He at first tried to sell me a $200 bundle, then offered to give me a 50% discount voucher, but would only get half the bundle (which isn&#x27;t really a discount?</li>
            <li> I explained that I live 110 miles away from the mall, and asked if I could ship the products back.</li>
            <li> I explained that I live 110 miles away from the mall, and asked if I could ship the products back.</li>
            <li> (I later learned that the product’s main ingredient, Sodium Potassium Aluminum Silicate, produces an exothermic chemical reaction when mixed with water.</li>
            <li> I will steer clear of this store next time</li>
            <li> I would stay as far away as possible.  </li>
            <li> this is a complete product for your facial pblms .</li>
            <li> Went as far as to admire my jewelry and tell me that he wanted to get some like it for his dear mom back in Israel.</li>
            <li> Watch out San Francisco---they are planning to open a store near Union Square.</li>
            <li> The store apparently has no business license or state registration (if it does, it&#x27;s under some name not on the store/receipts).</li>
            <li> He allowed her 30 days to test the product and get a full refund if not satisfied.</li>
            <li> It did appear that in a few seconds a laugh line was lighter.</li>
            <li> Organic Innovation\\&quot; allegedly organic cleanser and moisturizer, and they were not what I experienced in store---had a horrible smell, and I would never buy anything with a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I was stonewalled;not giving up; will spend as much time as it takes, go to the store and hand my research to every potential victim before they set foot in the store, if necessary.    </li>
            <li> He showed me that the box was damaged (there was a small tear in the top layer of paper in one corner of the black box)</li>
            <li> He showed me that the box was damaged (there was a small tear in the top layer of paper in one corner of the black box)</li>
            <li> The rubbing action caused a large number of small oblong-shaped masses to appear.</li>
            <li> He scooped a small amount out of the jar and placed it in the palm of my right hand.</li>
            <li> it really does clear your acne,i was a bit skeptical at first but after using it.</li>
            <li> He pointed to what appeared to be small, gold colored balls dispersed in the white cream, and he stated that the balls were “pure gold”.  </li>
            <li> There was no change in the color of my facial skin, and the dry flakey skin that was on my nose was still there.</li>
            <li> There was no change in the color of my facial skin, and the dry flakey skin that was on my nose was still there.</li>
            <li> In the bag was Deep Sea Cosmetics, the alleged lower end line of the company that owns both (Universal Handicraft, Inc. out of Florida).</li>
            <li> The white balls remained white and did not turn dark.</li>
            <li> The white balls remained white and did not turn dark.</li>
            <li> The long list of ingredients includes esters and silicones.</li>
            <li> The long list of ingredients includes esters and silicones.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are extremely pushy sales people, especially the guy in Vegas (must be Tony).  </li>
            <li> He said that the product would get rid of eczema and all other facial skin conditions.</li>
            <li> He placed the damaged box next to the other box.</li>
            <li> He placed the damaged box next to the other box.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t remove the product from my face and said they wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the other side unless I bought the $3000 facial set</li>
            <li> I would hate someone else falling into the same trap and for this reason I am writing a review (my first ever).&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, the shop off Oxford Street no longer sells Adore products which they swiftly replaced with Tresor Rare cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Then he launched into a very long sales pitch, and demonstrated (on my wrist)</li>
            <li> After I let it dry, I rubbed it as Mr. Baras had rubbed my wrist, and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> After I let it dry, I rubbed it as Mr. Baras had rubbed my wrist, and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> There is no New Hampshire company called Adore Organic Innovation or any variation thereof.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is no New Hampshire company called Adore Organic Innovation or any variation thereof.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s apparently the product composition that turns into little balls of gel.</li>
            <li> If there was a sign near the register stating that refunds are not allowed, it must have been quite small as I did not see it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Seeing as I&#x27;m paying half and only receiving half).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked at the ingredients and was shocked to see “sea salt” (not Dead Sea salt) and “Mineral Oil” (a non-organic oil derived from petroleum) as the first and second ingredients.</li>
            <li> I looked at the ingredients and was shocked to see “sea salt” (not Dead Sea salt) and “Mineral Oil” (a non-organic oil derived from petroleum) as the first and second ingredients.</li>
            <li> I had to pull it off in little balls that were actually adhered to my face.</li>
            <li> I am ashamed to say that I have been conned and regret bitterly having spent all this money.</li>
            <li> A few days after starting to use this product notice the change</li>
            <li> This facial peeling gel by Adore showed some promise to me after a few days of usage, my acne was reduced drastically and it also got rid of the lines</li>
            <li> it did nothing remotely resembling skin removal.</li>
            <li> and I saw absolutely no change at all.</li>
            <li> Jonathan stated that what he was rubbing off from my wrist was “dead skin cells and impurities” located deep within my skin.  </li>
            <li> He appeared to be very knowledgeable about the Adore products, and he explained the science behind the “fruit stem cells” upon which these organic products were based.</li>
            <li> are minimally visible.</li>
            <li> are minimally visible.</li>
            <li> one online report said the victim put the peel on a granite counter and a toilet seat, and the \\&quot;dead skin\\&quot; peeled off just as it did on his face.</li>
            <li> This was certainly not the product that Mr. Baras used on my wrist – not even close.</li>
            <li> This was certainly not the product that Mr. Baras used on my wrist – not even close.</li>
            <li> He showed me a small jar of what appeared to be a white substance, and asked me to smell it.</li>
            <li> He also produced four other boxes, containing the eye gel, the eye cream, the face cream and the peeling gel.</li>
            <li> He stated that the heat meant that the product was working and building collagen under my skin.&lt;br /&gt;After washing the mask off with paper towels, he showed me a small pot of the CELLMAX “Redefining Facial Cream”.</li>
            <li> In other words, these claims have not been scientifically proven and are therefore untrue.</li>
            <li> In other words, these claims have not been scientifically proven and are therefore untrue.</li>
            <li> Extremely pushy sales people.</li>
            <li> Without a second thought, I decided to buy and try it on me, and the result has been unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Two other products were thrown in-\\&quot;Adore</li>
            <li> And on my way out, i would hear other salespersons use words like:</li>
            <li> My skin was very rough.</li>
            <li> I am also wondering if he put some dirt or other black substance on his fingers before rubbing it off from my wrist to make it appear that dirt and impurities were being removed from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am also wondering if he put some dirt or other black substance on his fingers before rubbing it off from my wrist to make it appear that dirt and impurities were being removed from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I encountered a store at my local mall and they push really hard.  </li>
            <li> it was totally lifeless and dull..</li>
            <li> As he kept rubbing, the masses turned dark, indicating the removal of dirt.</li>
            <li> After it dried, I started to rub it, and a few round white balls were formed.</li>
            <li> After it dried, I started to rub it, and a few round white balls were formed.</li>
            <li> and I mean a lot of money back.  </li>
            <li> then produced two jars – one containing the Dead Sea salt scrub, and the other containing the Body Butter cream.</li>
            <li> Then nobody tells you you can&#x27;t return it if even a few minutes later even if no guarantees of a product that are promised during the hard sale take place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He motioned for me to approach him, and he handed me a small white bag containing a small sample of Adore Nourishing Hand and Body Lotion.</li>
            <li> I thought I saw a difference in that the treated eye seemed to have less visible lines.</li>
            <li> then placed a black box containing all three CELLMAX products in front of me, and said that he could sell the system to me for $1,600.</li>
            <li> He then said – as he had said previously – “let me see what I can do for you”.</li>
            <li> He then said – as he had said previously – “let me see what I can do for you”.</li>
            <li> Thinking that perhaps I used too little, I applied a thicker coating to my face.</li>
            <li> Thinking that perhaps I used too little, I applied a thicker coating to my face.</li>
            <li> mediocre product that you can get from Target in a pretty packaging at ridiculous prices.</li>
            <li> My heart sank as I read complaint after complaint from people who had purchased Adore products at boutiques located in different parts of the country.</li>
            <li> My heart sank as I read complaint after complaint from people who had purchased Adore products at boutiques located in different parts of the country.</li>
            <li> This company is also known as Dead Sea Cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> I let them waste their time with me but bought nothing.  </li>
            <li> My three children under 5 are what saved me and allowed an escape from the heavy pressure that was being applied, thank goodness.  </li>
            <li> Besides for a few blemishes here and there, my acne is gone.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife since she are using it for a few months</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> the product on my wrist had dried, he began to rub it with his fingers.</li>
            <li> After a few seconds, he poured water over my hands to get rid of the salt, and after drying my hands with a paper towel; he placed some “Calming Body Butter” cream on the tops of my hands and asked me to feel the tops of my hands.</li>
            <li> then decided to use the Dead Sea salt.</li>
            <li> then decided to use the Dead Sea salt.</li>
            <li> Which I did buy a few items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced such intimidation, by 2 people who surrounded me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; dead skin.    </li>
            <li> this is a really heavily perfumed product.</li>
            <li> The pitch was all about 100% organic (that could only apply to Adore&#x27;s Organic Innovation line, and it&#x27;s false, in my opinion--read the label, with a magnifying glass).</li>
            <li> We left without buying anything and spent the next several hours wiping the nasty, crusty residue off our faces.</li>
            <li> Bad cosmetic,  absolutely overpriced, aggressive selling...</li>
            <li> This is a totally fraudulent scam/pressurized marketing operation using way substandard and often harmful mediocre cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Your left with that stomach churning feeling that you&#x27;ve just been had...</li>
            <li> it is past.</li>
            <li> He then said that the salt was activated with water, and he had me place my hands over a bowl while he poured out a small amount of water.</li>
            <li> Rude and pushy after repetitively telling them I was&#x27;t buying</li>
            <li> hard</li>
            <li> I  accidentally caught eye contact, some guy named Ian (could be Ivan, but hard to tell), approached me about how I should do a demo of their products and when I told him after about 10 times that I am not purchasing it, he refused remove it.  </li>
            <li> Just rude and dismissive additude.</li>
            <li> I could feel the heat as soon as he applied the thick cream to my face, and when I communicated this, he acted relieved that the product would work for me.</li>
            <li> was duped out of $1,200 for worthless products that contain the same ingredients (other than the apple culture) as those products that can be found at Wal-Mart, CVS, or Walgreens.</li>

            <li> The Facial Peeling Dead Sea Minerals is horrible!</li>
            <li> The reason I googled this company is because of the uneasy experience I had and the poor quality of the product which was being sold at quite a lofty price.</li>
            <li> (I have since learned that although gold is malleable, it is pressed into thin sheets and gold leaf using metal presses – not ones finger.)  </li>
            <li> I tried thermal mask, peeling gel and eye serum, and i just hate myself for actually spending money on them.</li>
            <li> People have been asking me what is my secret</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for the people who got scammed.</li>
            <li> Worst facial gel product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> BUT after I purchased this expensive line and got home, used it faithfully for 2 months and saw nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> had I known it was merely a jar of salt and mineral</li>
            <li> had I known it was merely a jar of salt and mineral</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s illegal in my state.    </li>
            <li> Just wasted 4250.00-the worst decision I made on this Maui vacation.</li>
            <li> He then offered to show me a revolutionary, cutting edge eye serum and eye cream that would get rid of the wrinkles, regenerate my collagen and remove the under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> He stated that this product works as well as a surgical face-lift – without cutting into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> The skin didn&#x27;t feel any softer than the untreated one, though it did tingle unpleasantly, like a sort of chemical burn.</li>
            <li> It was an unpleasant product and experience.</li>
            <li> Bad, bad, bad...</li>
            <li> At one point Mr. Baras stated that he used to have really bad acne and that that this product got rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> If you thinking about buying expensive acne products save your money!!</li>
            <li> it was my sister&#x27;s wedding and my skin was going through a very bad phase...</li>
            <li> ADORE Cosmetics does not tell you ever until after purchasing their horrible products they are non refundable.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Stay away from Adore products and anyone trying to sell them. I am ashamed to say that I have been conned and regret bitterly having spent all this money. None of the products I tried worked as I saw no improvements whatsoever, despite using the products for 2 months and following the guidelines to the letter. A total rip off. I would hate someone else falling into the same trap and for this reason I am writing a review (my first ever).&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, the shop off Oxford Street no longer sells Adore products which they swiftly replaced with Tresor Rare cosmetics. As Tresor Rare products are sold by the same bunch of salesmen/women, in the same aggressive manner, I would advise anyone to steer clear of Tresor Rare products too.</li>
            <li> Stay away! mediocre product that you can get from Target in a pretty packaging at ridiculous prices. Pushy salespeople are all over you. If you-ESCAPE AND RUN! Do not waste our money. Spend them on drinks at the bar. Just wasted 4250.00-the worst decision I made on this Maui vacation.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re now in the UK in London selling from Covent Garden and Westfield. Stay away, I fell for their very agressive sales technique and apparent good deal. They&#x27;re relentless and they do not refund their products even if they make your skin itchy. The products are highly chemical, nothing organic about them.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I see  really here is that people just don&#x27;t like the sales people. My skin is aMazing I&#x27;M 65 years old and I see great difference in my skin. and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> great results, my skin feels smoother than ever</li>
            <li> ADORE Cosmetics does not tell you ever until after purchasing their horrible products they are non refundable.  Run fast when you see this company.  I was told no problem when I said I had sensitive skin on returning -LIE!!! I have been fighting 3 months to get my money back and I mean a lot of money back.  This company is also known as Dead Sea Cosmetics.  I had an allergic reaction to the product, returned and refused shipment so I am out $2300 with nothing to show for it.  This company does not tell the truth at all.  I would stay as far away as possible.  I am not even sure it is all natural like they say because of the way my face felt like it was on fire.&lt;br /&gt;If I could do under 1 star I would.</li>
            <li> I encountered a store at my local mall and they push really hard.  I let them waste their time with me but bought nothing.  The guy did try products on me, putting some stuff on one eye.  There were results, the exact same results I get when I bother to use the moisturizer I have at home.  There is no reason to buy this stuff, it is overpriced and relies on mind games to sell it.  Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I, like many people, was pulled in while walking through a shopping area in Paris casino in vegas. I let the girl do her demo on me, told her I saw no difference with the tightening &amp;#34;anti wrinkle&amp;#34; stuff, and then let her do the peeling gEl on my wrist, which I again saw not much difference (I am 33 and actually have very good skin everywhere except my face) . I asked her for a sample of the peeling gel since I didn&#x27;t want to try it on my face there, with my makeup. she made no mention of me being able to returN it and was overall very up front with me, though still trying high pressure sales. She ended up selling me a brand new jar of the peeling gel for $34 and put a huge handful of the sample lotions in my bag (this was after a 10 minute conversation, mostly me saying I wouldnt pay that much for face product, after her showinge the great $160 deal she could give me for the gel). I figured, for just under $40, if it didn&#x27;t work I wouldn&#x27;t mind. but I use it on my face and neck once a week, see a wonderful improvement and difference in my skin, and even the lotion samples she gave me are fresh and lightweight and effective.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if something was so magical they wouldn&#x27;t have to do high pressure sales. I&#x27;m sorry for the people who got scammed. But if you can get them down to a price you are happy with, the products are actually really good. For reference, I do not put just anything on my face. I use bare escentuals for most of my makeup, and a few other high end cosmetics (guerlain, dior, to name two).</li>
            <li> I bought this product from the mall kiosk like the other two reviewers did and the salesperson, while being very pleasant and amiable, was very pushy and hard set into having me and my friend make a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;We were at the kiosk for probably 20 minutes getting the different products tested on us and we told the saleswoman that We have student loans to pay so we can&#x27;t afford this, and she said that since we have sensitive skin and she wanted us to have a product that would help it better than Clean &amp; Clear, she offered to drop the price from $199 to $175. So that got me thinking and I told her I&#x27;m broke and don&#x27;t have that kind of money to spend on something I know nothing about and I wouldn&#x27;t be willing to spend more than $30 on it.&lt;br /&gt;She thought about it and said since she wants us to have this product for our beautiful faces she can drop the price to $39.99&lt;br /&gt;So me and my friend both walked away with this $200 chemical peel for $40.&lt;br /&gt;You just have to haggle.</li>
            <li> This is a totally fraudulent scam/pressurized marketing operation using way substandard and often harmful mediocre cosmetics.  AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE &amp; raise awareness with appropriate consumer authorities.</li>
            <li> fantastic product ! my skin look so much better now ! love it!</li>
            <li> Product 100% recommended, my face was a total mess, this product has been a real blessing, this product has helped me with my acne, my face is much cleaner, healthier, my self-esteem is very high, the bad times are over, I love this product has returned me the confidence in myself, i feel that I look younger and more radiant, soon after first use I see very rapid changes; one more time recommend this excellent product, and encourage everyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> Bad, bad, bad... Bad cosmetic,  absolutely overpriced, aggressive selling... Never again!!!</li>
            <li> I was leaving the mall and the Adore shop is right by the entrance so I got stopped by a salesman. He offered to show me some of their products and had me sit on a chair. To my surprise, he pulled his chair right in front of mine, effectively boxing me in. Then he launched into a very long sales pitch, and demonstrated (on my wrist) their exfoliating cream, lotion, and toner. The skin didn&#x27;t feel any softer than the untreated one, though it did tingle unpleasantly, like a sort of chemical burn. He at first tried to sell me a $200 bundle, then offered to give me a 50% discount voucher, but would only get half the bundle (which isn&#x27;t really a discount? Seeing as I&#x27;m paying half and only receiving half).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, very high pressured selling tactics. Their products aren&#x27;t any different from stuff you can get for much cheaper. They smell nice, but that&#x27;s about it. I will steer clear of this store next time I visit the mall.</li>
            <li> My experience is very similar to many of these reviews I have read.  I, too, was pulled in and given numerous complements (my husband was asked if he was famous, my children told that they were gorgeous)...  The sales man did not want me to try the product on my face, only my wrist; I put it on my face anyway.  It was an unpleasant product and experience. Then I was offered hundreds of dollars of complimentary product with the purchase of a gold facial.  My three children under 5 are what saved me and allowed an escape from the heavy pressure that was being applied, thank goodness.  The reason I googled this company is because of the uneasy experience I had and the poor quality of the product which was being sold at quite a lofty price. I wouldn&#x27;t even use these products if they were given to me for free. Please beware.</li>
            <li> I love this brand. I have a few of their products and have been very satisfied with the results. Also I think the sales personnel are extremely good at their job!</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using Adore products because a friend recommended it. This product is wonderful to combat expression lines. A few days after starting to use this product notice the change, I recommend it 100%. If you are a person who wants to use Botox, I tell you first try this product, you&#x27;ll love.</li>
            <li> do u have skin allergies .do u have pimples . so this product is best for u . this is a complete product for your facial pblms . u will not regret using this product . and it is moderately priced . delivery of amazon is excellent . you will love this product. I have used this product it has helped my face to look 5years younger and it is better than botox</li>
            <li> This product is a rip off ... Burns the skin ... Washed it off .... Still burning ... The eye area is too sensitive for this overpriced product . If you are walking by one of their stores run fast.... Someone needs to call the TV News stations and report this company, possibly a reporter can go under cover and expose them</li>
            <li> I literally couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product . Adore&#x27;s Facial Peeling Gel along with some other products that I&#x27;ve tried in the past and immediately became a permanent part of my skin care &amp;#34;arsenal&amp;#34; is AMAZING !!! Not over priced for the quality that you get .&lt;br /&gt;Moreover , their customer service personnel are very intuitive, professional , and helpful !&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended .</li>
            <li> I only purchase my products directly from the source since I love the ingredients but the prices on the website are a little over my budget personally but whenever I call the corporate office I always get a great promotion or discount all you have to do is call! I&#x27;m even posting my &#x27;after&#x27; pic so you can see how great this peeling mask works!!! Maybe one day I&#x27;ll even show the before ;)</li>
            <li> My senior parents bought this product at a retail store in las vegas during a trip . Tony at the Adore store at the miracle mile shops in vegas assured my mom that the $491.86 of Adore product including the facial peeling gel would work wonders. He allowed her 30 days to test the product and get a full refund if not satisfied. He hand wrote this full refund claim. My mom tested the product in New York and after 2 weeks contacted Tony at the Adore booth at 3663 las vegas blvd and was told to file a customer claim form.After weeks of waiting, my parents called Tony back and were told to dispute the refund through their credit card. Nothing ever came of that even after repeated followups. The credit card cannot help as they say that Tony at the Adore shop manipulated the sales receipt. There are no refunds and Tony scammed my parents. Adore will not help as they say you can only return unopened packages. So how is someone supposed to test it to see if it helps !! The product made no difference in  my mom&#x27;s skin. Do not buy this product as it is ineffective. And do not give Tony at the Adore at 3663 Las Vegas Blvd any of your trust.</li>
            <li> i really like these products, since i started using Adore products my face looks 5 years younger, my acne finally is over , thanks to Adore. these products are very helpful.now its your chance to experience good quality.</li>
            <li> I am Using Adore Products for Two Years. And I am Very Happy With Their Product. They All are Good. This Product is Really Very Effective. They Made My Face Look 5 Years Younger. This Product is Really Better Than Botox Product. I see Changes to My Face within Some Days. Now my Face is Much Clean, Healthy and good looking. This is a Excellent Product. I Recommended it to Use.</li>
            <li> This Produkt ist absolut helpful against acne. It made my face look 5 years younger. I still tried everything I promise, but that Peeling is the best solution ever.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Adore Essence Facial Peeling Gel for about a week now and I must say that is the best facial exfoliator I&#x27;ve used so far! I have always have acne breakouts and this does open my pores and really cleans up my face. I have been monitoring its effects, and the changes are obvious. I highly recommend this if you are looking for the best skin exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I am using Adore products and they are very helpful. It helped me with acne, and made my face look 5 years younger :)...I will strongly suggest to everyone.</li>
            <li> I was pressured by this Italian salesman at Palazzo Las Vegas and was promised that I can  return the product, no questions asked. Not only did the products not work, but they did not accept my returns, nor did my credit card dispute work. Do not give in to them. Stay away!</li>
            <li> i dont care what they post ,its true they promotion talking nice try hard cos they want this job..im understand,,we buy thier product not thier people,,any one have problem with the skin after used this product?i love this product after i used it.my sensitive skin just fine,,not red or bump,but smooth and soft ..shine clear,,,thank adore</li>
            <li> When I start to use this product it gives my face a extra fairness.my face is becomes very shiny and brightness.I 100% recommended it.My skin was very rough. After Using this I feel it is a excellent product.</li>
            <li> I also bought 3 Adore products--- have not &#x27;dared&#x27; to try the facial peeling gel yet though.  Yes, they are extremely pushy sales people, especially the guy in Vegas (must be Tony).  As soon as I got back from Vegas, I called my cc company and disputed the sale (using the 3 day decision guideline).  Had not opened the boxes.  Adore insisted i could not return it, i insisted I could! and would!  The dispute ended happily for me.  They did not pursue it, I kept their rotten products.</li>
            <li> My skin looks 100% better after using this product. Besides for a few blemishes here and there, my acne is gone. This was my second time ordering it and I cut it a bit too close because I started to break out like before. However I got this and put it on right away and my skin returned back to being blemish free. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, it has been one of the only things that has worked for me! Great product that gives great results!</li>
            <li> Acne has been in my life for as long as I remember and I have tried many products and spend so much money trying to get rid of it.  This facial peeling gel by Adore showed some promise to me after a few days of usage, my acne was reduced drastically and it also got rid of the lines plus my face looks much younger and radiant.  But I see it is unavailable at the moment, when are you going to replenish your stock?</li>
            <li> First of all they practically block your way in the local mall and double team you for the sale. The quote was for $150. I stated I&#x27;ve never paid more the $50 for any facial gel. POOF! Magically they&#x27;re selling to you today for $49.95. that should have set off alarm bells but they were very good. Looking over their shoulder at a person who appeared to be a manager type and speaking in hushed tones as to not draw attention to their sale price offer, they bum rushed me into the sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried the product and it did nothing remotely resembling skin removal. Worst facial gel product I&#x27;ve ever tried. What a scam! No refunds. No help at the website. Just rude and dismissive additude. Your left with that stomach churning feeling that you&#x27;ve just been had... and you have.</li>
            <li> i totally loved the product...it gave amazing results to my skin..it was my sister&#x27;s wedding and my skin was going through a very bad phase...being a dusky complexion i am very concerned about my color..and it was becoming very dark ..it was totally lifeless and dull..also i was struggling with my acne problem..i was very worried..when i bought this product it gave me amazing results in no time..it comes in beautiful packaging .i religiously used the product as it was instructed and in one month my skin had become adorable...my acne were gone ,my skin become radiant, and also the complexion was also improved to 2 shades...my skin was looking 5 years younger !!! it gave Botox like results...I would totally recommend the product to everyone who is struggling with skin issues specially like acne ,fine lines,dull skin...its an amazing amazing product to try on...Do use the product and feel like princess as i do :) :)</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife since she are using it for a few months and i have to admit her face is really better now looks like five year younger and her acne almost dissapeared, now she is very happy and im very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Yeah, the guys at the Kiosks are so pushy, especially at the Aventura Malll.  I  accidentally caught eye contact, some guy named Ian (could be Ivan, but hard to tell), approached me about how I should do a demo of their products and when I told him after about 10 times that I am not purchasing it, he refused remove it.  I don&#x27;t care so much about having to wipe it off, but just the attitude.  Geez, how unprofessional.  I would never buy your products just from the behavior of the sales people.</li>
            <li> Was in Las Vegas and had several pushy people trying to get us to stop and let them try a product on us. Unfortunately, I finally did.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever they put on your face, is not what they sell you! It did appear that in a few seconds a laugh line was lighter. BUT after I purchased this expensive line and got home, used it faithfully for 2 months and saw nothing.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very strong old rose scent that is not becoming. The Facial Peeling Dead Sea Minerals is horrible! When used, it would roll and stick to my face. I had to pull it off in little balls that were actually adhered to my face. It makes your face feel greasy and I saw absolutely no change at all. What a waste of money. Any try returning it! There is no way to get your hundreds of dollars back and return this product. Stay out of the stores that are scamming women!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it a 2 rating for now. Kind of scared after ready the reveiws. I was approached and lured in at the mall. After saying no he showed me the damaged box, just like one of the reveiws said was done to her, and said he would sale me the facial serum for 200.00 and give me the callogen cream for free.when I wasn&#x27;t sure and said no, he presented the dry skin exfoliating cream for free. So I got all three for 200.00. I used them on my face, but it has only been one night. I like the way my face feels, but I need to wait for some time to tell if it is a total scam. I do think thought hat this product is high priced. They are very pushy and aggressive too.</li>
            <li> it really does clear your acne,i was a bit skeptical at first but after using it. Many of my friends said i look younger and it&#x27;s really better than botox</li>
            <li> One of the best facials I have ever used, it turned out to be very refreshing and made me look naturally shiny which I wanted. .This product will be provided with a solution for expression lines. The main feature of this product is that its very natural and its pretty much royal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Now my face looks younger and my problem with acne it is past. I really love the results from this product, my skin feels smooth and clean does not feel dry but hydrated. I recommend 100% this product</li>
            <li> I just started using this, so far so good.</li>
            <li> If you buy it from a store, you will be high pressed with the aggressive sales that make a used car dealer and a time share salesman look like a mild mannered kitten.  Then nobody tells you you can&#x27;t return it if even a few minutes later even if no guarantees of a product that are promised during the hard sale take place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself doesn&#x27;t work for what it is marketed.  It doesn&#x27;t produce promised or expected results any more than a $15 product from your local CVS or Walgreens, yet you can&#x27;t return it at all. Stay away but it&#x27;s possible if you&#x27;re reading this you might have been suckered into buying it like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that case all you can do is complain to the FDA about suspicious practices and write an honest poor review as I&#x27;m doing here.</li>
            <li> Excellent experience at Lincoln rd in Miami this weekend  :)&lt;br /&gt;Love the product !!!</li>
            <li> On Saturday, December 27, 2014, I was on my way out of the Fox Run Mall located in Newington, New Hampshire, when I made eye contact with a young man named Jonathan Baras. He motioned for me to approach him, and he handed me a small white bag containing a small sample of Adore Nourishing Hand and Body Lotion. Once he handed the bag to me, he asked me to enter the boutique and stated that he had something to show me. He had me sit in a chair at one of the several stations located inside the store. He asked me if organic facial products were important to me, to which I responded “yes”. He showed me a small jar of what appeared to be a white substance, and asked me to smell it. He then asked me to hold out my right wrist, and he place a small amount of the product on the underside of my wrist, explaining that the facial skin was very much like the wrist skin. He rubbed the product in with a white plastic spatula and while waiting for it to dry, he explained that we have seven layers of skin and most products only work on the top layer. He further explained that Adore’s “Essence Facial Peeling Gel” works on all seven layers of skin, removing impurities and ridding the skin of toxins. I stated that I have very sensitive skin and frequently break out in eczema. He said that the product would get rid of eczema and all other facial skin conditions. At one point Mr. Baras stated that he used to have really bad acne and that that this product got rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;Once the product on my wrist had dried, he began to rub it with his fingers. The rubbing action caused a large number of small oblong-shaped masses to appear. Jonathan stated that what he was rubbing off from my wrist was “dead skin cells and impurities” located deep within my skin.  As he kept rubbing, the masses turned dark, indicating the removal of dirt. He then cleaned it off with water and a cotton pad, and had me compare my two wrists. He indicated that the treated wrist looked “brighter” than the untreated wrist. I thought that the treated wrist looked different than the untreated wrist; however I was wearing a watch on my left wrist. (After thinking about the entire sales pitch, I believe that it was most likely the power of suggestion that caused me to think that my treated wrist looked different.) He then put some “Essence Facial Hydrating Cream” on the treated wrist and asked me to feel how silky my wrist now was.&lt;br /&gt; He appeared to be very knowledgeable about the Adore products, and he explained the science behind the “fruit stem cells” upon which these organic products were based. He stated that these highly specialized stem cells came from a very rare Swiss apple, and that these stem cells penetrate all seven layers of skin and cause collagen to grow which gets rid of wrinkles and fine lines. He then showed me a jar of what appeared to be large salt crystals. There was no liquid or oil in the jar – just the salt crystals. After having me smell the salt, he stated that the salt crystals came from the Dead Sea and had very special properties. He scooped a small amount out of the jar and placed it in the palm of my right hand. He then said that the salt was activated with water, and he had me place my hands over a bowl while he poured out a small amount of water. He then asked me to scrub the tops of my hands and my fingers with the salt and water mixture. After a few seconds, he poured water over my hands to get rid of the salt, and after drying my hands with a paper towel; he placed some “Calming Body Butter” cream on the tops of my hands and asked me to feel the tops of my hands. I noted that my hands were very smooth and silky. Mr. Baras then stated that the silky smoothness would last an entire week, through showers and hand washings. (The silky smoothness disappeared when I washed my hands with soap and water after leaving the mall.)&lt;br /&gt;He then asked me what my major facial skin concern was, and like most middle aged women, Iresponded by stating the fine lines around my eyes was my major concern. He then offered to show me a revolutionary, cutting edge eye serum and eye cream that would get rid of the wrinkles, regenerate my collagen and remove the under eye puffiness. He put some “Advanced Firming Eye Serum”, followed by “Advanced Firming Eye Cream” under my left eye and then had me look in a mirror. He said that he could already see a big difference between my two eyes. I thought I saw a difference in that the treated eye seemed to have less visible lines. (This was only because the eye products contain silicones which temporarily fill in wrinkles until washed off.)&lt;br /&gt;He then produced two jars – one containing the Dead Sea salt scrub, and the other containing the Body Butter cream. He also produced four other boxes, containing the eye gel, the eye cream, the face cream and the peeling gel. He said that what he had placed on the table before me was a year’s supply of all the products and that Adore was having a special sale on the Dead Sea Salt and the Body Butter. He stated that both products were only $800. I stated that I could not afford to pay $800. He then said that Adore products are “very high end” and therefore cost quite a bit of money. He asked me if I was willing to “invest” in my face. I said that I was, but not for $800. He then said “let me see what I can do for you” and he left to retrieve what appeared to be an iPad with the calculator app activated. He punched in some numbers and stated that he could use his “voucher” to give me a special deal but that I could not tell a soul about the deal because he was offering it only to me. He then turned the iPad toward me so that I could see the $400 figure. He then stated that for $400 ($200 for the eye serum and $200 for the eye cream) he would add in the face cream, the facial peeling gel, the Dead See salt and the Body Butter for free – and he then added another “free” product to the pile called “Essence Facial Cleanser”. I thought I was receiving a terrific deal for such technologically advanced products. I followed him to the register, where he took my credit card and swiped it. He handed me the slip to sign, then he produced the sales receipt. He pointed to the receipt and listed off each product I had purchased, and the percentages off the original prices I had received. I did not read the “fine print” at the bottom of the receipt. Please note that this fine print was never discussed before I paid via my Chase Freedom Visa, nor was it pointed out to me after I was handed the sales receipt.&lt;br /&gt;As I started to walk out, he said “let me show you something else”. He then pointed to the “CELLMAX – Maximizing Skin Stem Cells Rejuvenation” line of products, and explained that the cost of the three individual products was $2,300. He offered to try the products on the right side of my face, and I agreed. I had no intention of purchasing the $2,300 treatment. I certainly am not wealthy by any means and that kind of money is out of my reach. He stated that the CELLMAX products penetrate all seven layers of the skin and cause the skin to generate stem cells that form new collagen. He explained that the first step is the application of the “Superior Facial Thermal Mask”. As he was preparing to place this cream on my face, he stated that it doesn’t work for all people, and that if I did not feel the mask heating up, it would not work on my skin. I asked what would cause the mask not to work and he replied that if there is not enough collagen under the skin, the mask wouldn’t work. I could feel the heat as soon as he applied the thick cream to my face, and when I communicated this, he acted relieved that the product would work for me. (I later learned that the product’s main ingredient, Sodium Potassium Aluminum Silicate, produces an exothermic chemical reaction when mixed with water. Therefore, the heat is produced regardless of one’s collagen level. This claim was yet another falsehood.) He then wet his hands and rubbed the mask over the right side of my face, which generated more heat. He stated that the heat meant that the product was working and building collagen under my skin.&lt;br /&gt;After washing the mask off with paper towels, he showed me a small pot of the CELLMAX “Redefining Facial Cream”. He pointed to what appeared to be small, gold colored balls dispersed in the white cream, and he stated that the balls were “pure gold”.  He further explained how pure gold benefits the skin, and that Cleopatra, “the most beautiful woman who ever lived” used pure gold on her face. He stated that in order to use the product properly, one must ensure that a “gold” ball is included in the cream removed from the jar. He further explained that the gold ball must then be rubbed with a finger and mixed with the white cream. He demonstrated this to me by placing some cream (with a gold ball) on the back of his hand and pressing on the gold ball with his finger. The gold ball flattened out and mixed in with the white cream. (I have since learned that although gold is malleable, it is pressed into thin sheets and gold leaf using metal presses – not ones finger.)  After applying the cream and another product called CELLMAX Elite Facial Serum to the right side of my face, he handed me a mirror and told me that he definitely could see a difference between the left and right sides of my face. I did not see a difference but he assured me that my right side was more “lifted” and pliable than the left side, and that the longer I left the mask on, the better it would work. He stated that this product works as well as a surgical face-lift – without cutting into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;He then placed a black box containing all three CELLMAX products in front of me, and said that he could sell the system to me for $1,600. I stated that I do not have that kind of money. He then said “let me see what I can do for you”. He walked over to a display kiosk, and came back with a second CELLMAX box. He showed me that the box was damaged (there was a small tear in the top layer of paper in one corner of the black box) and he stated that his boss would not let him sell the item because the box was damaged. He placed the damaged box next to the other box. I again stated that I could not afford $1,600. He then said – as he had said previously – “let me see what I can do for you”. He punched some numbers into his iPad, and muttered something about using another employee’s “voucher”. He then turned the iPad toward me. It stated $800. He said that he could sell me the $2,300 treatment for $800, but I could not tell his boss because he was selling it to me at a loss. He also said that he would include the products in the damaged box for free. He also stated that I would also receive six free facials. (That was never put in writing and therefore I have no proof of this “extra bonus”.) I was elated. I know that the current price of pure gold is around $1,100 an ounce and I thought that I was purchasing cream containing pure gold. I believed every word he said – that this advanced system would rebuild my collagen and get rid of my lines and wrinkles. He again swiped my card and I signed the slip. He again provided a receipt and pointed out the two products, the price I paid and the percentage off the original prices that I had received. Again, he did not at any time state that the products cannot be returned for a refund. I assumed that a reputable business would accept products back if they did not perform as described or if I had an allergic reaction, etc. The only time that I purchased non-returnable items was when Coldwater Creek was going out of business. The saleswoman made sure that I understood that all sales were final before I purchased any clothing. There were several large signs placed next to the cash registers that all sales were final.&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Baras was so professional and believable that I fell for it all – hook, line and sinker.&lt;br /&gt;On December 28, 2014, I tried the facial peel. I applied it to my face in the same manner that he applied it to my wrist. After I let it dry, I rubbed it as Mr. Baras had rubbed my wrist, and nothing happened. I then tried the product on the left underside of my wrist, and again nothing happened. Nothing rubbed off. Thinking that perhaps I used too little, I applied a thicker coating to my face. After it dried, I started to rub it, and a few round white balls were formed. They did not rinse off with water, and I had to literally pull them from my face. There was no change in the color of my facial skin, and the dry flakey skin that was on my nose was still there. The white balls remained white and did not turn dark. This was certainly not the product that Mr. Baras used on my wrist – not even close. I am also wondering if he put some dirt or other black substance on his fingers before rubbing it off from my wrist to make it appear that dirt and impurities were being removed from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I then decided to use the Dead Sea salt. The jar itself is a smoky-colored glass and the contents of the jar are minimally visible. I was very surprised when I took the cover off and removed the plastic from the jar opening. This was not the product that Mr. Baras demonstrated on my hands. This jar contained oil along with salt. I looked at the ingredients and was shocked to see “sea salt” (not Dead Sea salt) and “Mineral Oil” (a non-organic oil derived from petroleum) as the first and second ingredients. The product that Mr. Baras showed to me was a jar containing only salt with no oil. I would not have been interested in this product had I known it was merely a jar of salt and mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;I then looked at the ingredients of the purportedly organic CELLMAX products. The second ingredient in the thermal mask is PEG-8. PEG stands for “Polyethylene Glycol” – this is antifreeze! I then looked at the ingredients of the CELLMAX facial cream – the one that purportedly contains balls of pure gold. The first ingredient is water.  The long list of ingredients includes esters and silicones. Gold is not listed in the ingredients. Therefore, Mr. Baras outright lied to me that the gold-colored balls were in fact pure gold. The CELLMAX facial serum also contains mineral oil, as does the Calming Body Butter and the eye serum.&lt;br /&gt;I then went online and “Googled” Adore Organic Innovation. My heart sank as I read complaint after complaint from people who had purchased Adore products at boutiques located in different parts of the country. The complaints described the same sales tactics as were used on me – including the “don’t tell a soul about this deal”. The complaints also stated that the customers could not get their money back. I immediately then looked at the sales receipts and my heart sank even further when I saw “No Refund!” written at the bottom. Jonathan Baras never told me that refunds were not permitted. I would not have purchased the products had I known because I have very sensitive skin and most products make my face break out. This no refund policy is disreputable in and of itself. If there was a sign near the register stating that refunds are not allowed, it must have been quite small as I did not see it.&lt;br /&gt;I then did some research on the so-called Swiss apple stem cells – referred to as “Mauls Domestic Fruit Cell Culture” in the list of ingredients for each product. Each time this ingredient is listed, it is followed by an asterisk (*.) At the end of the ingredient list, there is another asterisk followed by the words “Stem Cell Activator”. I didn’t think my heart could sink any lower, but it did.  Adore did not discover, create, make, or otherwise produce the purported stem-cell technology. This so-called “novel” technology was developed by Mibelle Biochemistry, a Swiss company that develops products for use in the cosmetic industry.  Although Mibelle claims that its product protects longevity of skin stem cells, delays senescence of essential cells and combats chronological aging, there is no conclusive scientific data backing these claims. In other words, these claims have not been scientifically proven and are therefore untrue. I noted that the sales slip also refers to the Fox Run Mall Adore store as “Top management llc”. I researched New Hampshire’s SOS website and found that there is no company registered under this name. There is no New Hampshire company called Adore Organic Innovation or any variation thereof.&lt;br /&gt;I then called the Adore store at the Fox Run Mall and explained why I was dissatisfied. I asked if I could return the products for a full refund and was told “no”. I was told that I need to come to the mall in person to further discuss this. I explained that I live 110 miles away from the mall, and asked if I could ship the products back. I was told that there was nothing they could do over the telephone and that I had to come in person. I again asked if they would give me a refund and I again was told that they would not.&lt;br /&gt;I was duped out of $1,200 for worthless products that contain the same ingredients (other than the apple culture) as those products that can be found at Wal-Mart, CVS, or Walgreens. The claims regarding the stem cells are false.&lt;br /&gt;I am very ashamed that I fell for this scam, and I can ill-afford $1,200. I was willing to pay this exorbitant price because I believed everything I was told by Mr. Baras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to ship the products back too the Fox Run Mall store, and I have opened a dispute case with my credit card company.t I can do for you”. He walked over to a display kiosk, and came back with a second CELLMAX box. He showed me that the box was damaged (there was a small tear in the top layer of paper in one corner of the black box) and he stated that his boss would not let him sell the item because the box was damaged.

            <li> Watch out Santa Barbara. These guys are located on State Street. If it was a legitimate product that really did what it is supposed to do they wouldn&#x27;t have guys trying to pull you in off the street. I got the whole &amp;#34;You have beautiful eyes&amp;#34; treatment. Went as far as to admire my jewelry and tell me that he wanted to get some like it for his dear mom back in Israel. Yeah, right. This stuff comes with a list of &amp;#34;inventive&amp;#34; ingredients that would confuse even the most savvy cosmetic scientist. I let him put some goo on my hand to get rid of him and it burned within 15 minutes. Watch out San Francisco---they are planning to open a store near Union Square. I wonder if these guys are related to the &amp;#34;Dead Sea&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Oro Gold&amp;#34; people that you see hawking similar junk in the malls.</li>
            <li> Extremely pushy sales people. Wouldn&#x27;t remove the product from my face and said they wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the other side unless I bought the $3000 facial set (In a joking manner of course). Just no. Rude and pushy after repetitively telling them I was&#x27;t buying and I was in a hurry they wouldn&#x27;t stop. It&#x27;s almost harassment, I felt like I was being bullied into buying. Which I did buy a few items. They work, but just as well as Clique. I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money or feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a &amp;#34;special price&amp;#34; &amp;#34;just for you&amp;#34;  Trained con artist is all they are, the product isn&#x27;t even that great.</li>
            <li> I was also scammed by this &amp;#34;adore&amp;#34; company in  Las Vegas. I was suckered into buying the eye firming syrum and instant face lift cream. It has practically burned my under eye area. I tried to take the products back within two days and was told they do not do refunds or returns...so I disputed with my credit card. Hopefully I can recoup the charges.  Don&#x27;t talk to these people, very high pressure...</li>
            <li> My Mom used this instead of her botox and she told me to use for my acne. I tried it for my acne and i could honestly say im finally acne free. If you think about doing botox save your money the answer is right here. If you thinking about buying expensive acne products save your money!!</li>
            <li> Since my teenage years, I&#x27;d been through the problem of dealing with acne and pimples on my face making me less expressive and less confident. I was looking for a complete care for these acne and pimples and I found Adore Cosmetics Essence Facial Peeling Gel. Without a second thought, I decided to buy and try it on me, and the result has been unbelievable. It has completely got rid of my acne problem and has made me look much younger and expressive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced such intimidation, by 2 people who surrounded me. I finally succumbed, planning to return it for a refund,just to escape. Got home with the bag, and there was a bait&amp;switch, in my opinion. I was at an \\&quot;Adore Cosmetics\\&quot; store, and was told, not that I believed it, the peel normally costs $600 (the receipt says the $160 paid was a 73% discount). (It&#x27;s posted at adorecosmetics.com for $189--maybe the store had a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; site to show customers?) When I started to use my phone to look it up, the aggressive woman said,\\&quot; no, no, here it is\\&quot; (on her phone).    In the bag was Deep Sea Cosmetics, the alleged lower end line of the company that owns both (Universal Handicraft, Inc. out of Florida). It goes for a max. $65 online (and it&#x27;s at their proprietary site, so obviously inflated). Two other products were thrown in-\\&quot;Adore Organic Innovation\\&quot; allegedly organic cleanser and moisturizer, and they were not what I experienced in store---had a horrible smell, and I would never buy anything with a strong smell. Bait&amp;switch, in my opinion.    The pitch was all about 100% organic (that could only apply to Adore&#x27;s Organic Innovation line, and it&#x27;s false, in my opinion--read the label, with a magnifying glass). Deep Sea doesn&#x27;t even claim to be organic.    The kicker--one online report said the victim put the peel on a granite counter and a toilet seat, and the \\&quot;dead skin\\&quot; peeled off just as it did on his face. It&#x27;s apparently the product composition that turns into little balls of gel. It&#x27;s not \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; dead skin.    There was no visible notice of any no-refund policy. It was only on the receipt. That&#x27;s illegal in my state.    I&#x27;ve done a lot of research. The store apparently has no business license or state registration (if it does, it&#x27;s under some name not on the store/receipts). There is no working phone number on the receipts (calls meet a \\&quot;voicemail not set up\\&quot; message). No phone number or any info is available online. It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t exist, in an age where everything is online.    I had picked up a flyer that had the home company&#x27;s contact (number and address used by many entities), called and tried to get satisfaction. I was stonewalled;not giving up; will spend as much time as it takes, go to the store and hand my research to every potential victim before they set foot in the store, if necessary.    Dispute the charges on a credit card. Report them to BBB. Report them to your city and state authorities (it&#x27;s easy to find out whether they are licensed to do business, online). This post is my opinion only.    Btw, they claim the stuff sold on Amazon, E-Bay, etc., for lower prices, is \\&quot;fake.\\&quot; Sure.</li>
            <li> Never ever fall for their tactics, the discounts and free stuff. Their products are not worth a penny; now that i tried their products, i wouldn&#x27;t take them even if offered for free. I tried thermal mask, peeling gel and eye serum, and i just hate myself for actually spending money on them. For me, all red flags were raised when the sales person offered a mind blowing discount, which i should refused. And on my way out, i would hear other salespersons use words like: this is only for you, which part of their selling tactics.</li>
            <li> These products are completely useless and this company is nothing more than a scam operation. If you&#x27;re not convinced by the reviews here, take a look at the list of ingredients on their products (oh wait, you can&#x27;t find an ingredients list online). You can buy $5 products at Walgreens with higher quality ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A salesperson put a collagen treatment on my face and my mother&#x27;s face. We left without buying anything and spent the next several hours wiping the nasty, crusty residue off our faces. Yuck!</li>
            <li> this is a really heavily perfumed product. I used it as a sample and it gave me a migraine from all the fragrance. i prefer natural products with moisturizer. also there have never been proven benefits of plant stem cells.</li>
            <li> Two words - FRAUD &amp; SCAM</li>
            <li> This product was amazing and cleared my acne within a few weeks. It&#x27;s absolutely phenomenal and would recommend to all my friends. People have been asking me what is my secret and I tell them it&#x27;s this facial peeling gel. I&#x27;m so happy with this product. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I just returned from Vegas and had the same experience. Some man just pulled me out of the crowds walking by. I got all the same info given to me. Was there for at least 30 min or more. Did not want to take NO for an answer. Even offered 1 product with another free. I was one of the lucky ones and managed to get out of the chair and walk away. Boy am I glad I did. I knew when I got home I would look up the prduct to get info for myself. Thank goodness I did not purchase this!!!!!!!!! Thanks for the reviews!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Adore cosmetic product is one of the best products i have used.It helped me for my acne treatment.This product gave me a fresh look to my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is better than any other available products in market.</li>
