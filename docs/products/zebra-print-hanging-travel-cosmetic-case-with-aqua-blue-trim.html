            <li> I would have rather had the turquoise blue shown in the picture, the actual blue is much deeper.  </li>
            <li> but now I give it a 1 star because it didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the last one I purchased which mind you lasted 2 years before I needed to replace.</li>
            <li> it is bigger than i expected.</li>
            <li> So now, I have to be careful every time I open this cosmetic bag all the way because all my stuff with just fall out which is a pain.</li>
            <li> She actually keeps her tools in it, pink mini hammer, screw driver, nails, screws, etc</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is if you have tons of makeup like me you will take up most of the room of the bag.</li>
            <li> On the trip home I had to stuff a few more things in and it became difficult to close...</li>
            <li> A little smaller than expected, but holds a lot of items.  </li>
            <li> it closed</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful not to fill the sections too tight.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this one to replace another I had previously bought 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> The color is a little darker but its still aqua/blue.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product, shouldn&#x27;t break this easily.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>

            <li> This Cosmetic bag is very pretty. The only bad thing is if you have tons of makeup like me you will take up most of the room of the bag. I still have some room but I have a lot of makeup. Has many different zippers to organize better. Overall a great purchase</li>

            <li> I purchased this for my teenage neice. It is perfect for any type of traveling over night or for before and after sport events. Design makes it perfect for all ages</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup bag for my daughters dance competition.  Two of the pockets ripped after one use.  All we did is hang it on our rack and took makeup out of it and back into it during one show.  The pockets just came apart like the thing was made of tissue.  Horrible product.</li>
            <li> This make-up bag holds everything I need! I love it!</li>
            <li> Great toiletry bag.  Provides much versatility and fits easily into luggage.  Good construction and nice size.  May consider buying more for gifts</li>
            <li> First time I used it the plastic  ripped away so you have to be careful not to fill the sections too tight.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this item but it didn&#x27;t come with a hook that&#x27;s why its 4 instead of 5&lt;br /&gt;zebra fan love the fabric</li>
            <li> I am only giving this 4 stars because the color blue in the picture is much lighter than on the actual product.  I would have rather had the turquoise blue shown in the picture, the actual blue is much deeper.  Product itself was nice.</li>
            <li> Perfect alternituve to your traditional college bathroom caddy. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this! it is bigger than i expected. the bottom bag is attached so that is a huge plus. it is also very spacious. i dont really have a big makeup collection but being a member of ipsy my makeup collection is starting to grow. The color is a little darker but its still aqua/blue.</li>
            <li> Not as many pockets as my dying one.....but it will do.  Kind of a funky smell but aired out well.</li>
            <li> Love this bag and cute color, my boyfriend made a comment it was nice looking!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and print. Worked exactly for what I needed it for. On the trip home I had to stuff a few more things in and it became difficult to close...other than that it was a perfect purchase! I even designed a passport cover and luggage tag to match!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this one to replace another I had previously bought 2 years ago. I was putting all my cosmetics into this one and upon zipping it closed the zipper flew right off. So now, I have to be careful every time I open this cosmetic bag all the way because all my stuff with just fall out which is a pain. I have this review a 2 originally because it&#x27;s a very cute design but now I give it a 1 star because it didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the last one I purchased which mind you lasted 2 years before I needed to replace. Very disappointed with this product, shouldn&#x27;t break this easily.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used for over a year or more now, has moved it back and forth from a dorm, to a sorority house, back home and back again and it has held up very well. She actually keeps her tools in it, pink mini hammer, screw driver, nails, screws, etc and it has held up with the extra weight so will totally work for your beauty items!</li>
            <li> Used this for a business trip. I was able to store all my bathroom toiletries inside. The bottom part of the bag is nice and roomy enough for small bottles. Great product!</li>
            <li> When I received my product I found that the velcro part is on the opposite side of the bag so I can not close the bag at all. Then a week or so later one of the zippers broke. Just seems all around cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Great travel helper.  Hangs up easily in the bathroom.  Easy visibility and organization of cosmetics.  Love that my cosmetics are all in one place and easily seen.</li>
