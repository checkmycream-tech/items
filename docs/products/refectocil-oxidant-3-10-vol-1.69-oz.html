            <li>This works great with the brow dye and it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It seems to me they want you to believe you need to purchase this for the dye to be effective.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, worth the price and works perfect with Refectocil cream dye (I use it for brow tinting only).  </li>

            <li>#34;Natural Brown&amp;#34; color and also for the &amp;#34;Light Brown&amp;#34; color for a more detailed review and helpful suggestions/ tips.</li>
            <li>I was torn on how many stars to give it, in theory, it is 5 stars because the product is effective, it is what it claims to be, and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>great product the best product for eye brows and lash tint our clients prefer it to any other product last for ever</li>
            <li>I tried this product and must say that I think it is better to let a professional do this.</li>
            <li>This brand seems to be consistent and is as represented by the description.</li>
            <li>It is just a way for them to over charge for something you can buy cheaper, and most likely have at home.</li>
            <li>So please be aware of this.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see that much change.</li>

            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This is the exact same thing as hydrogen peroxide you most likely have at home!</li>
            <li>Given that I only needed a few drops of this with the eyebrow dye, I thought it was a good value.</li>
            <li>Yes this works just as they stated it would I can highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>The active ingredients are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve found that actually puts color onto my pale eyebrows and lashes and lasts.  </li>

            <li> This little bottle will last a very long time if  you use it for eyebrows about once a month, but in the future I will do the same and bye regular hydrogen peroxide from Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to process and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li> You can check this products active ingredients, and the active ingredients on a bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide side by side, and observe they are the same.</li>
            <li> Please read my 2 other reviews on the Refectocil cream dye in &amp;</li>
            <li> Too large of a bottle for home use, I&#x27;m afraid it will expire by the time Im done using it.</li>
            <li> This develop very much work with RefectiCil color base.</li>
            <li> No More Mascara!</li>
            <li> BUT, I wanted to give it 1 star because it is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a money-saver no more expensive salon visits!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Best possible lash tint!</li>
            <li> This brand seems to be consistent and is as represented by the description. Utility product with no specifics of importance.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same thing as hydrogen peroxide you most likely have at home! I was torn on how many stars to give it, in theory, it is 5 stars because the product is effective, it is what it claims to be, and the shipping was fast. BUT, I wanted to give it 1 star because it is unnecessary. It is just a way for them to over charge for something you can buy cheaper, and most likely have at home. It seems to me they want you to believe you need to purchase this for the dye to be effective. That is not the case. You can use any hydrogen peroxide you have at home. The active ingredients are exactly the same. You can check this products active ingredients, and the active ingredients on a bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide side by side, and observe they are the same. So please be aware of this. But as I said, the product does work, it is what it says it is, and I did receive it on time. I will leave it up to you to decide what you think of this information. This information is my understanding, and what I personally observed with my experience with the product. I am not an expert. But I don&#x27;t think you need to be to make this simple observation. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great find. No More Mascara!</li>
            <li> I use this product for many years,I am happy to find this in USA too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve found that actually puts color onto my pale eyebrows and lashes and lasts.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to process and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  The color stays on my brows for weeks instead of fading in a week or so.  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Given that I only needed a few drops of this with the eyebrow dye, I thought it was a good value.</li>
            <li> Too large of a bottle for home use, I&#x27;m afraid it will expire by the time Im done using it.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the delivery of the product. It does everything that it states it will do. A lot of reviews before me said that they used peroxide from the drug store. This little bottle will last a very long time if  you use it for eyebrows about once a month, but in the future I will do the same and bye regular hydrogen peroxide from Target or Walmart. This was about 13.00 dollars and a bottle at target is like 88 cents.</li>
            <li> Yes this works just as they stated it would I can highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s a money-saver no more expensive salon visits!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and must say that I think it is better to let a professional do this. I really didn&#x27;t see that much change.</li>
            <li> great product the best product for eye brows and lash tint our clients prefer it to any other product last for ever</li>
            <li> easy to apply - into it about a month and still looks great</li>
            <li> This develop very much work with RefectiCil color base. I like this product, very well. I can&#x27;t do My coloring without RefectoCil Oxidant.</li>
            <li> You need the Oxidant to mix with the Hair Dye. This isn&#x27;t a bad product...my star rating is based on the fact that the LIQUID Oxidant doesn&#x27;t mix well with the CREAM hair dye. Next time I&#x27;m going to order the Cream oxidant and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be happier.</li>
            <li> Too watery. I would rather use a cream peroxide to mix my tint with.</li>
            <li> Use this with dye for eyebrows, works really well.</li>
            <li> This works great with the brow dye and it is easy to use.  I love using this and the results works for weeks.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Awesome product, worth the price and works perfect with Refectocil cream dye (I use it for brow tinting only).  Please read my 2 other reviews on the Refectocil cream dye in &amp;#34;Natural Brown&amp;#34; color and also for the &amp;#34;Light Brown&amp;#34; color for a more detailed review and helpful suggestions/ tips.</li>
