            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>The service was excellent.</li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I recommend sticking to the directions on the container, which state to apply to the under arms before bed for best results.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this from winter to summer and the results have been great.  </li>
            <li>like you&#x27;re wearing aromatic, pleasant tea all day</li>
            <li>the best and most cost effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pit juice, what more can you say.</li>
            <li>Really glad I tried this product</li>
            <li>I am glad I made the move.  </li>

            <li>I have to retract my earlier review of this product, which was not favorable, and tell you that this new oxygen formula is just as good as the original.</li>
            <li>Old products were better.</li>
            <li>but these are rarely in stock at the grocery store and I&#x27;m rarely at a drugstore where it&#x27;s much more likely to be available.</li>
            <li>but I am not a fan of this new oxygen  advanced.  </li>
            <li>My daily under arm perspiration has been negligible, with the exception of working out or working outside on a hot day, these perform greatly, to the point, where I can confidently wear a blue tailored shirt w/o an undershirt and not worry about stains under my arms.  </li>
            <li>In fact just a little better because it dries much faster then the original Mitchum.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just trying to market a distinctiveness against Certain Dri, but reality is, it&#x27;s 20% aluminum chloride, or a derivative, anyhow, and that&#x27;s why it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks alot Mitchum, you just lost a customer.</li>
            <li>They better bring the old formula back or lose a lot of customers.</li>
            <li>On really hot days, I might notice a slight dampness, but the whole &amp;#34;blocks your worst-smelling sweat&amp;#34; at that level of sweat release really is true-- highly marginal</li>
            <li>I like this new Mitchum except for the fact that it says it&#x27;s made for Men.</li>
            <li>Was a Mitchum customer for over 20 years, until this new redesign.</li>
            <li>Looks like I need to find a new underarm deodorant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apply before night night, so it has a chance to get in your skin a bit, then only splash soap and some water on underarms briefly next morning before lightly rinsing, and re-apply.</li>
            <li>right, I&#x27;m a guy, but I don&#x27;t smell like deodorant or a 40 year old&#x27;s cologne&amp;#34; kinda clean, subtle smell.</li>
            <li>and I think that developed a quasi-immunity to their products.  </li>
            <li>overall dampness doesn&#x27;t really care any odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice I&#x27;m sweating more than usual, but definitely am not odor free half way through the day.</li>
            <li>They changed the formula, but it seems to work the same as the old stuff.  </li>
            <li>The bottle looks a little too much like a sex toy, but that has no bearing on effectiveness, which is all I care about.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s pit juice, what more can you say. Old products were better.</li>
            <li> I like this new Mitchum except for the fact that it says it&#x27;s made for Men. I am a woman. Where is the female version of this product?</li>
            <li> Roll-on balls do NOT work correctly.  To difficult to deal with.  Was a Mitchum customer for over 20 years, until this new redesign.</li>
            <li> Great product!  The service was excellent.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with my other deodorants - either problems with odors, or else my shirts would eventually build up with deodorant in the armpits of the shirt making the fabric stiff. With this stuff, I never have problems with either. Really glad I tried this product and I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Gillette Clinical Protection guy for years and I think that developed a quasi-immunity to their products.  After research and reading reviews, I went &amp;#34;all in&amp;#34; on these Mithchum sticks.  I am glad I made the move.  They are odorless and colorless.  I recommend sticking to the directions on the container, which state to apply to the under arms before bed for best results.  I have been using this from winter to summer and the results have been great.  My daily under arm perspiration has been negligible, with the exception of working out or working outside on a hot day, these perform greatly, to the point, where I can confidently wear a blue tailored shirt w/o an undershirt and not worry about stains under my arms.  These do not leave any residue on my body or my clothes.  Keep in mind, there is a roll on ball which makes application easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a deodorant that compares to it&#x27;s effectiveness, duration and lack of stickiness.  I only wish they made a scented version.</li>
            <li> I only use Mitchum and the liquid is in my opinion the best and most cost effective. These are a bit expensive online but these are rarely in stock at the grocery store and I&#x27;m rarely at a drugstore where it&#x27;s much more likely to be available.</li>
            <li> Even better than the original.</li>
            <li> on time, as advertized</li>
            <li> Have used Mitchum rollon for over 30 years!  This new formula is no good.  Looks like I need to find a new underarm deodorant. They better bring the old formula back or lose a lot of customers.</li>
            <li> I love mitchum but I am not a fan of this new oxygen  advanced.  I don&#x27;t notice I&#x27;m sweating more than usual, but definitely am not odor free half way through the day.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula, but it seems to work the same as the old stuff.  The bottle looks a little too much like a sex toy, but that has no bearing on effectiveness, which is all I care about.</li>

            <li> Evidently the ones that gave this a good review haven&#x27;t used the original formula. If you are a long time user, you will be disappointed. This formulation doesn&#x27;t even last until the end of the day. I&#x27;ve used Mitchum for around 20 years but they have just lost a customer.</li>
            <li> Works fine but is &#x27;gooey&#x27; . Thats why only four stars.</li>
            <li> I used Mitchum for over 20 years because it is the one deodorant I&#x27;m not allergic to. They&#x27;ve changed their formula and call it &amp;#34;Oxygen&amp;#34; odor control. After trying it once, I broke out in a rash. Thanks alot Mitchum, you just lost a customer.</li>
            <li> Would use any other deoderant</li>
            <li> I use to resort to using Botox injections in my underarm (do not do this unless your cosmetic dermatologist has experience with botox for axillary hyperhydrosis, as it&#x27;s called) due to medication-induced perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is basically Drysol (20% aluminum chloride) and it works just as well as Botox, almost. On really hot days, I might notice a slight dampness, but the whole &amp;#34;blocks your worst-smelling sweat&amp;#34; at that level of sweat release really is true-- highly marginal overall dampness doesn&#x27;t really care any odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best part: like Drysol, this is odorless, so you can use The Body Shop&#x27;s for Men&#x27;s Maca root deodorant, which has a nice, masculine-yet-not-Old-Spicey, more... refreshing, clean, masculine, in a, &amp;#34;oh right, I&#x27;m a guy, but I don&#x27;t smell like deodorant or a 40 year old&#x27;s cologne&amp;#34; kinda clean, subtle smell. If you don&#x27;t want that (despite its cheap price online @ body shop&#x27;s website) to add to this, try Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s antiperspirant (non-alluminum, so it doesn&#x27;t add on to an already potent level) Men&#x27;s deodorant-- mountain spring for men is invigorating, clean, smelling-- but if you can still find it, their best is their unisex &amp;#34;Lemongrass,&amp;#34; but you&#x27;ll likely have to find it online (smells actually like lemongrass-- like you&#x27;re wearing aromatic, pleasant tea all day long-- even if you do Yoga, those weirdos won&#x27;t complain of it, since it doesn&#x27;t remotely smell synthetic) to add to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply before night night, so it has a chance to get in your skin a bit, then only splash soap and some water on underarms briefly next morning before lightly rinsing, and re-apply. I use 10 rolls, but you&lt;br /&gt;may get away with 5 or so, depends on your sweat levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;oxygen formula&amp;#34; is entirely contrived-- I&#x27;ve noticed no difference since reformulation, and chemically, how this would even work-- makes no plausible sense. They&#x27;re just trying to market a distinctiveness against Certain Dri, but reality is, it&#x27;s 20% aluminum chloride, or a derivative, anyhow, and that&#x27;s why it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have insurance, just ask your doc to rx you Drysol-- it&#x27;s generic, and has the same amount of aluminum, and unless your copays are ridiculous, it&#x27;s a generic roll-on. FYI: If this doesn&#x27;t work, adjust any stimulating medication, and keep in mind Botox injections for underarms works-- and insurance pays for it $1600 otherwise) because it&#x27;s FDA-approved for axillary hyperhydrosis (underarm excess sweating).</li>
