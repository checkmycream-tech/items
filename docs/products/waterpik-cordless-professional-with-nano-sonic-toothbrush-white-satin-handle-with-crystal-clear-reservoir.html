            <li>waterpik works great.</li>
            <li>so it is a win, win.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing a great job.</li>
            <li>but it is great for travel.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Product was that great anyway.</li>
            <li>My waterpik works great.</li>
            <li>If you travel on business or pleasure this would probably be a great unit to have and take with you.  </li>
            <li>Would be great for travel and of course doesn&#x27;t replace the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>This has a great design.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is also great bonus and works well.</li>
            <li>Does a great job...</li>
            <li>great tool, for the money.</li>
            <li>It works great with the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, these flossers do a great job for me in keeping my teeth and gums in great shape.</li>
            <li>It worked great... for 40 days.</li>
            <li>Works great for awhile.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have that option, or plan on traveling a lot, this waterpik is a great pick.</li>
            <li>Maybe I expect more of something!!    </li>
            <li>sonic toothbrush, however, was a VERY nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>It is very effective in removing food particles from between teeth.</li>
            <li>I would have liked this to come with the Tongue cleaner, and maybe the toothbrush tip!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re as nice as my teeth now!</li>
            <li>Good for teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Good replacement for the series with the rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>so this is a good way to take it with on the plane.  </li>
            <li>Good noisy drips a bit</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not that the Waterpik doesn&#x27;t work; it works fairly well, I suppose, but it&#x27;s quite a bit burdensome to operate.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Like the product, does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Cordless always seems like a good idea.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use an electric toothbrush because all my sink space is occupied by my beloved Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>But it does a good job in spite of the drawbacks.</li>
            <li>it is actually really good.</li>
            <li>If you want to take one to travel with, or you have a kid with braces that needs to floss often, this might be a good one to try.</li>
            <li>I like the feel of a good washing.  </li>
            <li>I think it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s bulky to hold and still do a good job of flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a good buy.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist said my gums are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous gums.</li>
            <li>Not as good as it was advertised.</li>
            <li>The pressure isn&#x27;t sufficient to feel like it&#x27;s doing much good.</li>
            <li>this was good service on their part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you didn&#x27;t have an electric toothbrush already, this would be a good starter one, I guess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First the good.</li>
            <li>So weigh out the options and determine if it is good for you.</li>
            <li>a good electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Not as strong as a plug in water flosser, but still very good.</li>
            <li>Works great and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>summarize: it is great for travel or for a beginner, but better models do exist.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>feel like this is works ok, but I have a really great Sonicare toothbrush that removes plaque and leaves my teeth feeling</li>
            <li>From my wife Sarah: I&#x27;ve been using this Waterpick Cordless Water Flosser for years, and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>... cleans better then any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, and is easily the best part of this package.</li>
            <li>I ever purchased and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>, I was impressed the first time I used it</li>
            <li>LOVE this water flosser!  </li>
            <li>So happy I purchased this carry water Flosser for traveling it works just fine and take with me when I travel.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li>for what it is, its amazing.</li>
            <li>Try effectively cleaning your teeth in 45 seconds.  </li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be done effectively.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this to take on a trip, and though it is not as forceful as the one I have at home, it did the job nicely, I can&#x27;t do without my waterpik</li>
            <li>It is effective in cleaning under permanent bridges and around crowns.  </li>
            <li>This portable cordless irrigator is so handy to use and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on my bathroom countertop.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush that&#x27;s included doesn&#x27;t impress me, but would be a handy travel toothbrush because of its size.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to have an opportunity to try the product through Amazon Vine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that at some point the novelty will wear off but for now, I&#x27;m loving my water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My family liked that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This waterpik seems to be a newer version of a waterpik I already own, which is the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This is definitely nice product for traveling or for urgent flossing during the day in the office.</li>
            <li>included toothbrush is a nice travel toothbrush</li>
            <li>The bonus toothbrush was a nice addition.</li>
            <li>Seems to be effective at removing food particles.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy and effective.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is really nice too.</li>
            <li>Good to keep healthy gums</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt the urge to fill it more than twice for a good flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tooth brush is nothing like one of those electric tooth brushes, but itâ€™s compact and nice to have one when traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But those who like this style of toothbrush may find handy for travel.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush can&#x27;t compare with my Sonicare, but it&#x27;s nice to have on overnight trips.</li>
            <li>I liked that one</li>
            <li>toothbrush is not as nice as the electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>waterpik is good at flosser but Philips&#x27; toothbrush is much more better than this one.</li>
            <li>People with braces will probably benefit most from it because flossing is practically a non-option, but everyone will be able to get good use from the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it is very easy to fill the reservoir.</li>
            <li>I feel very comfortable using MMS, and find it amazing.</li>
            <li>Two outstanding products wrapped  into a nice package.</li>
            <li>A toothpick is more effective as this model.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the device is suitable for children for a number of reasons, including this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- More effective than flossing</li>
            <li>The vibrating toothbrush seems like a novelty more than actually effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;MMS is a bit controversial</li>
            <li>but I find it utterly amazing and safer than most drugs.</li>
            <li>The water pressure just doesn&#x27;t seem that strong -- it seems like if I put water or mouthwash in my mouth and swish it around, forcing it through the spaces in my teeth, that it would be just as good or better.  </li>
            <li>Just right size for bathroom counter works great</li>
            <li>What I dont like is that the water runs out very quickly!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>- warm water is MUCH more comfortable!</li>
            <li>think this waterflosser does a great job for what its intended to be: a smaller, more portable version of a great device.  </li>
            <li>While the device claims to be the easy and more effective way to floss, I like to use it to supplement my string flossing.  </li>
            <li>But they work great and can certainly improve your dental check-ups.</li>
            <li>Product meets expectations,,, wish it was a bit more forcefull...</li>
            <li>sure if it truly makes a difference or not ?</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll find yourself sending more time refilling the machine than using it.  </li>
            <li>Hope my dental checkups will be better than ever.</li>
            <li>Love the flosser.</li>
            <li>And problem solved :)</li>
            <li>It seems like it needs more power.  </li>
            <li>I love Waterpik products.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be better if the water blast was stronger</li>
            <li>I love the brush :)</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to my family and friends and we all just love it.</li>
            <li>I thought that Waterpik that have been doing this for ages would have a stronger and better product than</li>
            <li>I should have read more of the online reviews with many complaints about the charger failing to work.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My gums are much better.</li>
            <li>Better yet, it&#x27;s time for them to transition to inductive charging the way the Philips flossers have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The instructions with the unit could be better.  </li>
            <li>You can veryquickly go through your top set of teeth with 45 seconds</li>
            <li>Now that I know what 5 stars means I can only give this excellent product 4 stars because love is precious and in my opinion reserved for people and living things.</li>
            <li>Battery life is ok nothing to brag about for sure.</li>
            <li>Well this works OK</li>
            <li>I love the portability of it and it seems to do a better job than just flossing.  </li>
            <li>I do use an electric tooth brush that I love.   </li>
            <li>There is not any place on this, or anything to keep your tips that fit on the waterpik after you use them!  </li>
            <li>It is ok, but you have to keep filling up water.</li>
            <li>I like my electronic toothbrush much better.</li>
            <li>I love love love the Cordless Waterpik.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, I admit --</li>
            <li>I have been a supporter of Waterpiks for many years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rechargeable, which is a must for me, so I don&#x27;t go through so many batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The flosser comes with a toothbrush which works ok, but just vibrates.  </li>
            <li>I fill the tank twice to use two times in order to get a more thorough flossing.  </li>
            <li>and it feels more like getting your teeth</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind, I love using this).</li>
            <li>It is not asked to do much more.</li>
            <li>it should be better if the water flow could be controlled by pressure.</li>
            <li>But are better than nothing when traveling.</li>
            <li>More work than string flossing</li>
            <li>Requires some counter space (certainly more than a pack of string</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the waterpik, I have braces and using this</li>
            <li>Love it but does splash all over my sink</li>
            <li>I bought the newer handheld version and found that one charge lasts for many, many uses.  </li>
            <li>Would like more volume.</li>
            <li>but we love it and have one in all our bathrooms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is OK.</li>
            <li>It has two pressure setting to which was OK.</li>
            <li>This design is also more ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also a much better electronic toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best bang for your buck, especially if you&#x27;ve never used a liquid flosser before.  </li>
            <li>This is the best bang for your buck, especially if you&#x27;ve never used a liquid flosser before.  </li>
            <li>What I need, healthy teeth every day.</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I almost feel goofy holding this monstrosity.</li>
            <li>The new Nano Sonic toothbrush is portable (great for traveling), easy to use, and does a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds charge okay and has nice water pressure to clean in between the teeth.</li>
            <li>works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s like sticking a Dremel tool in your mouth, but that would be an insult to the fine tools by Dremel with which you can do very detailed work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked great for a couple months, great idea, however I&#x27;ve had trouble with battery life.</li>
            <li>Love it and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean and I&#x27;ve had  no mold issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IF cords are important, you might consider the counter top model.</li>
            <li>I love to travel and travel light.  </li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s small and handy; perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s small and handy; perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>it takes up a fair amount of premium bathroom-counter real estate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact in comparison to other ones I&#x27;ve seen and the best part is that it&#x27;s cordless</li>
            <li>That is a true bonus for me!  </li>
            <li>Not as many pressure settings as the original.</li>
            <li>device is great for travel (not too bulky, can be wrapped around your towel to prevent it from breaking) but if you primarily are just going to use it at home, get the Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser, which is 90 seconds instead of 45, 7 tips instead of 4, with 10 pressure settings instead of 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s easy to carry.</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to use</li>
            <li>summarize: it is great for travel or for a beginner, but better models do exist.nded up briefly trying his cord waterpik, and would have to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>The batteries last for many uses on a charge, so I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Below where you put the tip in, is the tip Rotator, turn that to get the tip in..fits in easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate and maintain.</li>
            <li>They have kept my gums healthy and my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to hold, it is easy to operate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more &#x27;fun&#x27; than string flossing and more</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>The water gets under and on the gums and between teeth, easily cleaning between teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>but it leaked and wasn&#x27;t easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s too hazardous to put Li-ION inside, but I really wish this device had more water pressure.</li>
            <li>variety of tips are nice and with some patience you can get a good cleaning, however unless you have a reason for needing a cordless unit, I would strongly recommend sticking with a standard, corded unit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, I filled the water reservoir (which you can also fill with mouthwash for a better clean) and turn on the devise.</li>
            <li>This Waterpik is a good starter model for those who are new to water flossing or Waterpik.</li>
            <li>It really is comfortable and easy to hold and operate in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want the Waterpik flosser, fine.  </li>
            <li>and it does the job fine.  </li>
            <li>The unit work fine.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik is huge.</li>
            <li>Works great now and we&#x27;ll see 5 months from now when I go back for my DDS appointment.</li>
            <li>Water irrigation is so important for oral care .</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this Waterpik and will continue to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>This waterpik will make your teeth feel like you just came home from the dentist--clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great when it lasted - but very short life.</li>
            <li>Our bathroom water isn&#x27;t filtered, so warm tap water isn&#x27;t very tasty for us.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The included sonic toothbrush is fantastic</li>
            <li>I will happily use it as a travel Waterpik, when I always miss my big bulky buddy.  </li>
            <li>Even though there is a place to fill a tank with water, I found it to sit comfortably in my hand.</li>
            <li>Waterpic flossers fit it).  </li>
            <li>I also worried about how hygienic it was -- it wasn&#x27;t easy to drain the residual water or clean the interior of the device.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really great especially for those people that have braces.</li>
            <li>Also, there is no battery status indicator light.</li>
            <li>The nano-sonic toothbrush included is a nice bonus, especially if you decide you like that kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT, It replaced an older model i have had for years but finally quit working, this model is even better!</li>
            <li>After a few attempts, I was usually able to do a good job with this AND remembered to turn it off before taking it out of my mouth!</li>
            <li>The battery toothbrush that comes with it didn&#x27;t seem to be very useful at all, but it came with the waterpik, so why not.</li>
            <li>Very exciting -- although, perhaps, a bit wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think this version is very handy for travel, for people who are in the habit of using a water pik regularly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this awesome product, especially if you have braces.</li>
            <li>It is meant to be a lite version of the original Waterpik, which must be used with a cord.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it because of my braces</li>
            <li>which will cause non user/operation friendly (wires on the way</li>
            <li>Great product and long charge.</li>
            <li>Do you want cordless or clean teeth?  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all the attachments yet, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with the regular spray tip.</li>
            <li>When my daughter got braces she had problems keeping them clean.</li>
            <li>oh so clean.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a way to clean all of my teeth where I don&#x27;t at some point have my drool running all over the unit.</li>
            <li>I like the size and the idea, but they don&#x27;t clean so well.  </li>
            <li>I have to refill it during use to clean all my teeth.</li>
            <li>I still floss, but this machine  has helped to push out debris and cut back on my plaque significantly, and as you can tell, I&#x27;m obsessive about good dental hygiene.    </li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t be sure of that, it certainly has that appearance.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure that I will one day get a deluxe model now that I&#x27;m on my second flosser, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this one particularly for the price and</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure that I will one day get a deluxe model now that I&#x27;m on my second flosser, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this one particularly for the price and</li>
            <li>It is a great improvement over the previous model, and it makes the task quick and easy.</li>
            <li>a great addition for travel, but a cord version has a bigger reservoir, more power, so for a few bucks more, you get more bang for your buck.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the bright side, I&#x27;m quite a big fan of the Nano Sonic Toothbrush that comes with the Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Aquarius model (newest model) and that has been working well for my not so beautifully arranged teeth because the Aquarius model includes various pressure settings, which is what I really need.</li>
            <li>Purchase the plug-in model with an adequate water reservoir if you want clean teeth.</li>
            <li>After you use it for a while you will be able to do your whole mouth without a need to refill.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, string flossing is still necessary, although this machine is a good supplement.  </li>
            <li>like I also have, but it is very convenient and does the trick for most cases.  </li>
            <li>Good size fluid tank.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel good hitting your eyes or even the back of your throat.  </li>
            <li>B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] which is getting kind of old</li>
            <li>It is also true that it doesn&#x27;t have the power of a plug in version.  </li>
            <li>Good for travel - the adapter says 120v only though.</li>
            <li>The full size counter-top model&lt;</li>
            <li>I have the full sized one in my bathroom; this stays in my suitcase for travel.  </li>
            <li>Ok it pulses water fast.</li>
            <li>This is a cool gadget that provides blasts of water to floss on a semi-professional level.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not up to par with a true powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You can use it with a more gentle stream if you&#x27;re sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The various tips do a good job at getting at the plaque and</li>
            <li>Second, it felt sooooo good on my gums that I didn&#x27;t want it to quit.</li>
            <li>I am a religious flosser, and so I wanted to see how good Waterpiks are.</li>
            <li>A fairly compact, easy to set-up and use, water flosser that includes a small battery powered toothbrush that I&#x27;ve come to love.    </li>
            <li>Besides, I&#x27;m a television and film actor, so I really should do it because it makes me look good on camera--and to me that&#x27;s money in the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this new version of Waterpik&#x27;s affordable model, I am flossing</li>
            <li>This Sonic Flosser is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on my teeth to get them nice and clean, works very well</li>
            <li>My dental checkups are super</li>
            <li>This is a super product.</li>
            <li>One learns quickly to keep the thing in your mouth or it becomes an formidable squirtgun.  </li>
            <li>so I was really hoping this device could make the routine more exciting and convenient.</li>
            <li>Following the instructions I charged it, filled up the water reservoir with luke warm water and started Niagara Falls in my mouth to the sink.</li>
            <li>I use it on high and wish it had even more force.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve informed them of the problem repeatedly, and even got them to replace that first one under warranty, but they&#x27;ve done nothing to fix this huge issue.  </li>
            <li>youngest son has enjoyed using this and in fact uses this longer than he would with his normal toothbrush and flossing.</li>
            <li>The description of this product says it has an &#x27;ergonomic&#x27; design and that it is ideal for use in small bathrooms or for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t agree it is ideal for small bathrooms and travel.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s not bad, but it is worth noting.</li>
            <li>This new version also includes the Nano Sonic Toothbrush which I&#x27;m also pleased</li>
            <li>Just love using my new Waterpik.</li>
            <li>The Nano Sonic toothbrush is great as it takes less energy to brush the teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>(The first time, I squirted water all over the mirror, though!)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably strong enough for most people though.</li>
            <li>Better stick to the simple and easy floss.</li>
            <li>it leave my teeth squeaky shiny clean, the way they feel when you first leave the dentist after a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the free electric brush and the Waterpik quickly became a daily habit.  </li>
            <li>I found, after a little practice, this cordless unit a great asset to my regimen.    </li>
            <li>I tested it in many ways and by golly, even after flossing I saw some fine particles of food following use of the pick.  </li>
            <li>real questions you have to decide is this: How important is it that you have a cordless waterpik?</li>
            <li>Better then the old style.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as powerful as the countertop models I have used.  </li>
            <li>The water flossing does work, though I feel I have more control with my old fashioned floss.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fun to use.  </li>
            <li>It holds about 45 seconds worth of water.  </li>
            <li>If you tip it too far to the side, it will not be able to shoot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is nice product, but there is not enough water pressure when using the PIK attachments.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>However, this might be my own personal preference.</li>
            <li>Recharging is required and refilling is also required even more frequently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Oral B model is too powerful.  </li>
            <li>I do like it better than my old Water Pic with the separate water tank and water wand.</li>
            <li>Toilet Tree has a better oral irrigator!</li>
            <li>It does burn through the water it holds pretty quickly, but I don&#x27;t know what else one would expect</li>
            <li>For best results the unit has to be held upright which is doable when flossing, however when trying to run water through to clean it, it&#x27;s difficult to hold the unit upright and get the water in the sink versus spraying everywhere.</li>
            <li>Works good but extremely noisy.</li>
            <li>instructions says to place in mouth right before turning it on, otherwise it will splash everywhere.</li>
            <li>The water power is just right.  </li>
            <li>Its water capacity is described as &amp;#34;45 seconds.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s right on the button.</li>
            <li>Third, the battery life is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>but if you want a very thorough clean, expect 4-6 refills.</li>
            <li>I truly believe it&#x27;s better than flossing, but i think it boils down to how skilled you are at it</li>
            <li>Fits nicely on small bathroom vanity and works great.</li>
            <li>So much better than old, large one.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning under the gum line is crucial, &amp; this is is great too especially  </li>
            <li>The Nano Sonic Toothbrush runs on a single AAA battery and fits nicely in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li>The Nano Sonic Toothbrush runs on a single AAA battery and fits nicely in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li>I put off buying one for a while, but I&#x27;m glad I finally got one.  </li>
            <li>However, this is the first time using one.</li>
            <li>First Waterpik</li>
            <li>This is my first oral irrigation system/waterpik.</li>
            <li>It has become my primary toothbrush and even when the head is old, I&#x27;ll probably replace it with another.  </li>
            <li>This is my first first Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I have used tiny, vibrating travel brushes like the cute one included.  </li>
            <li>Instead, I&#x27;d just rely on regular floss for a few days on a trip, then do a good thorough job at home with our counter-top model (which we love).</li>
            <li>Because I like to make sure I get all of the junk out, I fill it up twice, but that is just my personal preference.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to keep it charged up every day!  </li>
            <li>The first couple of uses</li>
            <li>, I want to say it lasted a month before it first need to recharge.</li>
            <li>This set works really well for cleaning around my son&#x27;s braces and he loves to use it!</li>
            <li>This is my first water flosser, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I would recommend try it first in the shower.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give you my tips for use below, but first, here are the pros and cons on this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable in your hand, and allows for a natural grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time this happened I contacted the company</li>
            <li>add and rotate various antibacterial mouth washes (mostly of the health food store variety) in the water.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if had a cord like the regular waterpik.</li>
            <li>The water lasts 55 seconds on the lower setting and 45 seconds on the higher setting.  </li>
            <li>If I flossed even once a week that would be meaningful to my dental health, and therefore my health overall.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Waterpik!</li>
            <li>It will likely be better for traveling.</li>
            <li>I splattered water and mouthwash all over my bathroom mirror and sink the first time I used this because I had no idea how to.</li>
            <li>Nano Sonic toothbrush as well is much better than the cheap Oral B models I had been using until now, and for a bonus, this one has a replaceable brush head, which means less plastic items in land fills and floating around in our oceans.this</li>

            <li>(I use a sonicare), and the ONLY way to clean back effectively there is with a Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li>Again, this is a good item to buy if you&#x27;re considering paying big money for a top of the line model, but not sure if you would use it yet.  </li>
            <li>is a good item to buy if you&#x27;re considering paying big money for a top of the line model, but not sure if you would use it yet.  </li>
            <li>As one gets older, it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>(Honestly, I could care less about the Nano Sonic Toothbrush that comes with it, but more on that later.)</li>
            <li>Overall it seems to work good enough</li>
            <li>With experimenting, bending over the sink in different head tilts, I&#x27;ve become quite good at hiiting back and front gumlines.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth and/or gums, or if you have nicely arranged teeth without any crooked ones, this might work well.</li>
            <li>It is very good but the pressure is not strong enough....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, available easily only on the web, and when used carefully it has been very safe and effective for us, with way less side effects than antibiotics and antivirals.</li>
            <li>This however does not have enough power and large enough reservoir for good dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>It may be me but the water does splash around a lot and my sink was pretty much lined with water after I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The higher speed does very well in removing debris.</li>
            <li>This unit might also be good for those with small bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is true that it doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the capacity that the tub style has, but I don&#x27;t understand why people would compare apples to oranges like that.  </li>
            <li>The big problem with this unit is that the rechargeable battery wears out very quickly and the switch drains the battery when it is off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I felt my teeth were so clean &amp; fresh in much shorter amount of time comparing to regular flossing ..</li>
            <li>The upside is - the overall product seems well made and easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>I keep mine in the shower and find it easy to use daily.</li>
            <li>a single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is much better.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik will certainly sell you on the idea where the Oral B may not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Waterpik will certainly sell you on the idea where the Oral B may not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>system comes with four flossing heads; two standard, one with bristles, and one with a fine stream attachment.</li>
            <li>system comes with four flossing heads; two standard, one with bristles, and one with a fine stream attachment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still pretty big, but it&#x27;s much nicer than the original because you can just fill it up with water, use it, and then toss it under the sink.</li>
            <li>And I like the little vibrating toothbrush that comes free in the kit better than my clunky old Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Works well and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on sink</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also very bulky, the panasonic one collapses , so</li>
            <li>This fixed that issue and she has fun using it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to store it empty with the cap off so mold doesn&#x27;t grow.  </li>
            <li>To much power for my gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no battery indicator, so you have to periodically charge since you can&#x27;t tell how much battery there is left.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do floss, but not always as much as I should.</li>
            <li>Really cleaned my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>question you must ask yourself is how much you are going to use a Waterpik, and how you are going to use it.</li>
            <li>It doesnt hold much liquid</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>The body is very bulky and clumbsy to use because of it&#x27;s size and shape.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t hold much water.</li>
            <li>Has the power, maybe too much.</li>
            <li>I like these so much</li>
            <li>However I just don&#x27;t see how this can really get the stuff out of between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the whole thing tips into the sink and send a tsunami of mouthwash-flavored water on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by this model.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li>So I really appreciate that my youngest son enjoys this waterpik.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really resembles a cell phone from the 80s, the type you see a character pull out in a period film</li>
            <li>I have tried both pressure settings and the harder pressure seems to do a better job</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much counter</li>
            <li>It goes through it really fast.</li>
            <li>In the way of convenience (its a task when your parneter wishes to use it and needs to change heads when everyone is in a rush to get ready.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>Does not look very durable.</li>
            <li>One of the tubes included came with the whole damage.</li>
            <li>how much battery remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>While it works gently on the gums and between teeth, thereâ€™s a trade off.</li>
            <li>so you have to throw the whole thing out.  </li>
            <li>Cleans gums very well</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much power, but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>so I really dont have a review of that.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t care what the picture shows of the correct use of the Flosser; in the real world, your arm and the Water Flosser are going to be drenched.)</li>
            <li>If you have the counter real estate, I say, go ahead and get the countertop version, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>I have some hygiene concerns about multiple people using the device, even though each person can have his or her own personal tips.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just kind of messy to use.</li>
            <li>Of course, the time you remember that it needs to be recharged is right after you use it, and getting all of the water out of that hole is near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can direct the water stream right at the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>There are only two pressure settings, but unless you always have to do high pressure, the two settings included in this unit works fine.</li>
            <li>Even though the reservoir holds enough for only one use, it is quick and easy to refill.  </li>
            <li>The other question you need to ask yourself is do you want more than 45 seconds of time to waterpik or can you use it and not tip it sideways?&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay the current price for it (around $45 on Amazon) unless I had a significant need for this type of device and would be traveling for an extended period of time</li>
            <li>The waterpik comes with 2 power settings (a high and low setting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a huge learning curve in the beginning.</li>
            <li>You can only clean one or two teeth per refill</li>
            <li>is the only way to keep them clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Great for Travel,</li>
            <li>Not bad, but it runs out of water fast, requiring several refills during a cleaning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it with success knocking out colds and viruses in hours, quickly reversing lung and sinus infections, reversing a severe infection that may have had MRSA from a bug bite without pharmaceutical antibiotics that had my entire thigh swollen and oozing and my doctors freaked out, and I was completely cured from rosacea (which has no cure according to mainstream doctors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But even the high pressure didn&#x27;t really seem to do a lot.  </li>
            <li>Nice small head that gets around my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li>First and foremost this Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser does the job.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a smaller full sized electric toothbrush-</li>
            <li>So not sure how effective it is doing that.</li>
            <li>I have gotten almost two full weeks of once-a-day use out of it from only one charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This waterpik comes with great attachments and is small enough to live on my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>ok but kind of awkward to use</li>
            <li>WAY better than the former portable model,  Bigger capacity, easier to fill and the charge lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve become quite proficient at it and can now do a decent cleaning with one water fill.    </li>
            <li>The flosser is fairly decent, with the limitations listed above.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This in is basically the same thing but handheld and smaller, which is much better.</li>
            <li>Because of the limited size of the water reservoir you get only 30-45 seconds of flossing per fill, but the reservoir is very easy to fill.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone shopping for a Waterpik.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so he suggested this which he highly recommended...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the wired versions if you have the space.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this Waterpik if you have gum issues or if you wish to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this Waterpik if you have gum issues or if you wish to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive but of high quality.</li>
            <li>Stopped working in high setting after three months.</li>
            <li>It does the job, although I wish it had a little more power.  </li>
            <li>The water in the reservoir in the wireless runs out fast and you need to refill frequently.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as their larger, stationary model.</li>
            <li>I am assuming it works wonders in places where it works, which doesn&#x27;t include the places I normally travel to.)</li>
            <li>you first use the water flosser, the 45 second water capacity will not finish your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s powerful and the bristles actually rotate that I take in</li>
            <li>and you laugh because it looks so big and bulky compared to what we have know.</li>
            <li>(more than just a few days).  </li>
            <li>Works as expected, minimal directions included but sufficient, so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but if I get 5 years out of it I&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Knowing well in advance that I was in for 45 second of arm-drenching, I concentrated on the most sensitive areas in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is this: if you want a starter Waterpik, this model is a good one; if you need a Waterpik with more pressure settings and various tips for specific purposes--in my case, the pressure setting and tip for users with periodontal disease--I strongly recommend one to consider purchasing the Aquarius model; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>The water does empty quickly because the reservoir is smaller than the full size (fill it up 4 or 5 tines for each flossing.but</li>
            <li>However, after trying this model several times, I was less thrilled with the battery powered water pressure.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t give me a thorough enough, or strong enough</li>
            <li>I read the simple instructions, and got going right away.  </li>
            <li>While she is determined to continue using this cordless waterpik even though it messes up the bathroom sink, I on the other hand think that the mess to clean up after myself after using it to be more of a hassle.</li>
            <li>That said, the 7 oz. reservoir still isn&#x27;t big enough to clean my whole mouth.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think this will inspire me to floss any more regularly, but I do like the clean feeling I have after a quick session</li>
            <li>An odd failure, given that the portable one seems ideal for travel.  </li>
            <li>If you are traveling and really want to have a water flossing machine with you, this is certainly smaller than a counter-top machine, and seems to work about as well (standard attachments for the newest models of full size</li>
            <li>I bought this brand because my other Waterpik tips will fit on it.  </li>
            <li>This slightly updated version is just as powerful as the first one, holds just as much water, holds its charge for up to two weeks (so far), _and_ includes a battery-powered toothbrush as a bonus.  </li>
            <li>I get a new one of these about every two years.  </li>
            <li>all looks just as a scam to buy a new charger for 9 dollars</li>
            <li>Charging battery now to try out me new gadget.</li>
            <li>This one I&#x27;m reviewing is new, and it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.</li>
            <li>This new one has a NIMH battery</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a big thumbs up for me, and I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>This unit is almost identical to a Waterpik Cordless that I already own - as far as I can tell the only changes made on this model are a different plug for the A/C adapter and the color of the water tank (used to be blue, now clear).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering how long the charge lasts, and that the waterpik is reasonably small, I think this was a good</li>
            <li>And I was very surprised to receive an electric toothbrush as part of the package.</li>
            <li>They suggest starting with the lower intensity I (1), but that didn&#x27;t seem to do very much at all.</li>
            <li>They suggest starting with the lower intensity I (1), but that didn&#x27;t seem to do very much at all.</li>
            <li>I was going to let my younger kids use it, until I made a huge mess the first time; I think I&#x27;ll wait until they are older.</li>
            <li>Powerful and battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The force of the water is another issue, especially on the higher setting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When starting to use this,  Put the tips in your mouth first, then close your lips around it,  then turn it on,  </li>
            <li>This is my second one, the first could not be charged twice.</li>
            <li>When I finally got the hang of it, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Too strong messy and not eas y to regulate water pressure&lt;</li>
            <li>Would you buy a Smart car and later complain that it did not seat 8?  </li>
            <li>I had deep pockets around my back teeth, and I am sure I would loose some if I had not had this recommended to me by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>a powerful stream but would not able to clean as well as traditional flosser.</li>
            <li>In waited too long to be able to return an item that was not useful at all.  </li>
            <li>Clearly that would be silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really want to like it, but the battery stop charging after 3 months of constant use (once per day).</li>
            <li>Within 90 days this just completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li>OTOH, I&#x27;ve owned and been dissatisfied with the old portable model and spotted this one as I was ordering something else on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The lower power might still cause you some discomfort in the beginning if your gums are sensitive.</li>
            <li>Refilling requires turning off the machine completely.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by how well this works.</li>
            <li>I also have the non professional version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been an old fashioned floss guy.  </li>
            <li>And after using the Waterpik for about 2 weeks, I think I&#x27;m going to remain an old fashioned floss</li>
            <li>Couple that with the space it takes up and the &#x27;maintenance&#x27; required in it, I&#x27;ll just stick to old fashioned floss.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d give a cordless a shot, however it&#x27;s no where near as convenient.</li>
            <li>But as far as use...</li>
            <li>When I was getting too close to my gums the thing would stall out completely.</li>
            <li>I use it to floss frequently since I just got braces.  </li>
            <li>just wow</li>
            <li>I wonder if I&#x27;d have to order them from Waterpik directly?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It runs on a AAA battery and seems to last a reasonable length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>There are 2 speeds, start with lower speed; it&#x27;s forceful and gums can be sensitive,    </li>
            <li>With portability comes natural tradeoffs.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a compact form so it can only hold so much water.</li>
            <li>A coworker bought the non-professional version of this, and as far as I can tell there is no functional difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve completely reversed the gum pockets, infection and inflammation using the Waterpick and adding some antibacterials to the water.</li>
            <li>I had to refill 2~3 times to complete one water flossing.</li>
            <li>Only if you really want something cordless.  </li>
            <li>There are much smaller, lighter, and better water flossing wands out there, but they cost at least four times as much.  </li>
            <li>There are much smaller, lighter, and better water flossing wands out there, but they cost at least four times as much.  </li>
            <li>The old one stopped holding a charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, when I saw the Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser, I jumped at it.</li>
            <li>If it had a bigger reservoir it would weigh more (water is heavy) and then it would be bulky to use.  </li>
            <li>Here is where the full size counter-top model excels - you only have to hold the pik attachment itself on its long, flexible tubing, and you can get it to any angle with virtually no weight or bulk in your hand (unlike this cordless model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good for travel or casual home use.  </li>
            <li>, there is no charging light, indicating either that it needs charging, or that charging is complete (or if there is one, it is considerably well hidden!  </li>
            <li>But it does not produce the same water pressure as many other models, especially the corded models.  </li>
            <li>the cordless version there are obvious engineering disadvantages, one that you have to fit in a small form factor, therefore can&#x27;t keep nearly as much water in the reservoir, and you don&#x27;t have an unlimited power supply from the wall</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very messy &amp; easy to spill.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It will take multiple refills of the reservoir per use to do a decent job of flossing.  </li>
            <li>used an old countertop waterpik model from the 70s as a child, I was aware about what they were about, but living in an old NYC apartment with a small bathroom with no counter space, the large model was out of the question to my wife.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I suggest using it on low for a week or two while your gums get used to it before using on high.</li>
            <li>really, strength of the water was exactly the same and the battery didn&#x27;t last long , I used it twice and was already dead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The high setting on this unit produces about same pressure as 5 on the Aquarius.</li>
            <li>of water blasts out of the Pik in two settings (low and high).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the power isn&#x27;t as high as the waterpik I used as a kid, it is enough to get the job done, I just have to fill the reservoir 2-3 times (as I only use the high setting)&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>Very messy to use, better off getting regular plug in model.</li>
            <li>Then there&#x27;s the noise this thing puts out: it sounds like the motor is dying, which is no big deal (as that&#x27;s just the sound it makes), but I found it an odd noise.</li>
            <li>I had an earlier model,  but after a couple years of use the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge beyond two or three days; that is normal for rechargeable batteries of all types, of course.  </li>
            <li>if you can afford the larger Waterpik with the large tank, I suggest that for Daily use and this for travel!</li>
            <li>Other reviewers complain of how quickly it runs out of water but refilling it is so simple that I don&#x27;t see how there is any concern there.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s certainly quite a bit smaller than a traditional water flosser with a tank, it&#x27;s not small enough to be portable.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel this was actually cleaning my gums very well and will stick to traditional flossing.</li>
            <li>Lastly, there isn&#x27;t a charge meter on it to let you know when the unit is ready to be unplugged; again, not a big deal, but it makes conserving energy and extending battery life easier when you have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suspect much of the controversy about it is because it can&#x27;t be patented and it competes with many expensive drugs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This model still works well for a quick and gentle water flossing, but this Waterpik is not nearly as superior as the Aquarius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This unit is large and not very maneuverable.</li>
            <li>There appear to be only 2 pressure settings, low and high.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed this to my boyfriend who has the cord Waterpik version and his general advice can be summed up to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews, some people don&#x27;t like this unit or, perhaps, are unsure of Waterpiks in general.  </li>
            <li>Also likes the bonus toothbrush that came with it. :O)</li>
            <li>The third one (the Professional model)</li>
            <li>one thing that I would warn any purchaser is that you really have to be careful how you hold that machine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the big gun and the antibacterial that completely reversed my gum problems is an antibacterial/antiviral/antifungal called MMS (This stands for Miracle Mineral Supplement).</li>
            <li>This replaced an old Waterpik flosser I had for several years.  </li>
            <li>Alas, I was all the way to checkout when I decided to make sure that the charger was useable in Europe.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet mastered how to consistently keep the water from running down my arm, but I&#x27;m getting there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, and I believe this new one is just slightly lighter than the older one I was using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very anxious to see if I have a better report when I get my teeth cleaned at the dentist next month and will report back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you want to make a huge mess, you need to keep your mouth closed around the tip.  </li>
            <li>The tank holds enough water for me to do my entire mouth on low, and on high I may need 1-2 tanks (it depends).  </li>
            <li>AND this price is way less than what I can order it directly from Waterpik!!!!</li>
            <li>I just used it for one time then the battery started to run out so fast ( for like 10 sec ) and it stops working !</li>
            <li>I was reluctant of it making a mess at first.</li>
            <li>Even with the slightly larger tank completely full, and though the overall design is about the same size, it seems lighter than the previous model.  </li>
            <li>And the unit is big despite having only a modest size water reservoir.  </li>
            <li>The description read like they had finally gotten a useful portable, and since we&#x27;re headed for Spain in a few days, I decided to buy.  </li>
            <li>With any stretch of the imagination I couldn&#x27;t expect a more poorly designed dental appliance to be sold on the open market.</li>
            <li>My first one (the Plus model) basically fried the battery with green foam pouring out of the charging slot.  </li>
            <li>It can and will be messy when you first use it.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice to get to the point where you don&#x27;t spray all over the mirror, but even then it&#x27;s pretty messy.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it blasted out food particles; which is its primary job.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush it ships with is pretty lame; not vey powerful...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s being poorly position easy to accidently bump the switch</li>
            <li>The power ran down completely after only one use and it held slightly less fluid than was needed to make it through a single flossing--so it needed to be recharged after each use and filled twice for</li>
            <li>It is &#x27;easier&#x27; than flossing in that you don&#x27;t have to open your mouth all weird and angle string funny, but it&#x27;s also more work between the water refills and cleaning up the watery mess afterwards.</li>
            <li>Small and just right for a personal waterpik</li>
            <li>I fully understand that sonic toothbrushes are designed for minimal pressure on teeth (not hard brushing back and forth like an inexpensive traditional manual toothbrush).  </li>
            <li>Instead of getting out to refill half way through, I just learned to get through my entire mouth much quicker.</li>
            <li>I only use high, not sure why anyone would use the low setting (maybe for sensitive areas?).</li>

            <li> Does a great job...</li>
            <li> great tool, for the money.</li>
            <li> It works great with the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Great item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, these flossers do a great job for me in keeping my teeth and gums in great shape.</li>
            <li> It worked great... for 40 days.</li>
            <li> Works great for awhile.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have that option, or plan on traveling a lot, this waterpik is a great pick.</li>
            <li> Maybe I expect more of something!!    </li>
            <li> sonic toothbrush, however, was a VERY nice surprise.  </li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> It is very effective in removing food particles from between teeth.</li>
            <li> I would have liked this to come with the Tongue cleaner, and maybe the toothbrush tip!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re as nice as my teeth now!</li>
            <li> Good for teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Good replacement for the series with the rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so this is a good way to take it with on the plane.  </li>
            <li> Good noisy drips a bit</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not that the Waterpik doesn&#x27;t work; it works fairly well, I suppose, but it&#x27;s quite a bit burdensome to operate.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Like the product, does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Cordless always seems like a good idea.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use an electric toothbrush because all my sink space is occupied by my beloved Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> But it does a good job in spite of the drawbacks.</li>
            <li> it is actually really good.</li>
            <li> If you want to take one to travel with, or you have a kid with braces that needs to floss often, this might be a good one to try.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of a good washing.  </li>
            <li> I think it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s bulky to hold and still do a good job of flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a good buy.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist said my gums are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous gums.</li>
            <li> Not as good as it was advertised.</li>
            <li> The pressure isn&#x27;t sufficient to feel like it&#x27;s doing much good.</li>
            <li> this was good service on their part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you didn&#x27;t have an electric toothbrush already, this would be a good starter one, I guess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First the good.</li>
            <li> So weigh out the options and determine if it is good for you.</li>
            <li> a good electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Not as strong as a plug in water flosser, but still very good.</li>
            <li> Works great and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> summarize: it is great for travel or for a beginner, but better models do exist.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> feel like this is works ok, but I have a really great Sonicare toothbrush that removes plaque and leaves my teeth feeling</li>
            <li> From my wife Sarah: I&#x27;ve been using this Waterpick Cordless Water Flosser for years, and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> ... cleans better then any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, and is easily the best part of this package.</li>
            <li> I ever purchased and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> , I was impressed the first time I used it</li>
            <li> LOVE this water flosser!  </li>
            <li> So happy I purchased this carry water Flosser for traveling it works just fine and take with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> for what it is, its amazing.</li>
            <li> Try effectively cleaning your teeth in 45 seconds.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be done effectively.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this to take on a trip, and though it is not as forceful as the one I have at home, it did the job nicely, I can&#x27;t do without my waterpik</li>
            <li> It is effective in cleaning under permanent bridges and around crowns.  </li>
            <li> This portable cordless irrigator is so handy to use and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on my bathroom countertop.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush that&#x27;s included doesn&#x27;t impress me, but would be a handy travel toothbrush because of its size.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to have an opportunity to try the product through Amazon Vine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that at some point the novelty will wear off but for now, I&#x27;m loving my water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My family liked that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This waterpik seems to be a newer version of a waterpik I already own, which is the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This is definitely nice product for traveling or for urgent flossing during the day in the office.</li>
            <li> included toothbrush is a nice travel toothbrush</li>
            <li> The bonus toothbrush was a nice addition.</li>
            <li> Seems to be effective at removing food particles.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy and effective.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Good to keep healthy gums</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt the urge to fill it more than twice for a good flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is nothing like one of those electric tooth brushes, but itâ€™s compact and nice to have one when traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But those who like this style of toothbrush may find handy for travel.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush can&#x27;t compare with my Sonicare, but it&#x27;s nice to have on overnight trips.</li>
            <li> I liked that one</li>
            <li> toothbrush is not as nice as the electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> waterpik is good at flosser but Philips&#x27; toothbrush is much more better than this one.</li>
            <li> People with braces will probably benefit most from it because flossing is practically a non-option, but everyone will be able to get good use from the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it is very easy to fill the reservoir.</li>
            <li> I feel very comfortable using MMS, and find it amazing.</li>
            <li> Two outstanding products wrapped  into a nice package.</li>
            <li> A toothpick is more effective as this model.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the device is suitable for children for a number of reasons, including this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- More effective than flossing</li>
            <li> The vibrating toothbrush seems like a novelty more than actually effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MMS is a bit controversial</li>
            <li> but I find it utterly amazing and safer than most drugs.</li>
            <li> The water pressure just doesn&#x27;t seem that strong -- it seems like if I put water or mouthwash in my mouth and swish it around, forcing it through the spaces in my teeth, that it would be just as good or better.  </li>
            <li> Just right size for bathroom counter works great</li>
            <li> What I dont like is that the water runs out very quickly!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> - warm water is MUCH more comfortable!</li>
            <li> think this waterflosser does a great job for what its intended to be: a smaller, more portable version of a great device.  </li>
            <li> While the device claims to be the easy and more effective way to floss, I like to use it to supplement my string flossing.  </li>
            <li> But they work great and can certainly improve your dental check-ups.</li>
            <li> Product meets expectations,,, wish it was a bit more forcefull...</li>
            <li> sure if it truly makes a difference or not ?</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll find yourself sending more time refilling the machine than using it.  </li>
            <li> Hope my dental checkups will be better than ever.</li>
            <li> Love the flosser.</li>
            <li> And problem solved :)</li>
            <li> It seems like it needs more power.  </li>
            <li> I love Waterpik products.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be better if the water blast was stronger</li>
            <li> I love the brush :)</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to my family and friends and we all just love it.</li>
            <li> I thought that Waterpik that have been doing this for ages would have a stronger and better product than</li>
            <li> I should have read more of the online reviews with many complaints about the charger failing to work.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My gums are much better.</li>
            <li> Better yet, it&#x27;s time for them to transition to inductive charging the way the Philips flossers have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The instructions with the unit could be better.  </li>
            <li> You can veryquickly go through your top set of teeth with 45 seconds</li>
            <li> Now that I know what 5 stars means I can only give this excellent product 4 stars because love is precious and in my opinion reserved for people and living things.</li>
            <li> Battery life is ok nothing to brag about for sure.</li>
            <li> Well this works OK</li>
            <li> I love the portability of it and it seems to do a better job than just flossing.  </li>
            <li> I do use an electric tooth brush that I love.   </li>
            <li> There is not any place on this, or anything to keep your tips that fit on the waterpik after you use them!  </li>
            <li> It is ok, but you have to keep filling up water.</li>
            <li> I like my electronic toothbrush much better.</li>
            <li> I love love love the Cordless Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, I admit --</li>
            <li> I have been a supporter of Waterpiks for many years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rechargeable, which is a must for me, so I don&#x27;t go through so many batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The flosser comes with a toothbrush which works ok, but just vibrates.  </li>
            <li> I fill the tank twice to use two times in order to get a more thorough flossing.  </li>
            <li> and it feels more like getting your teeth</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind, I love using this).</li>
            <li> It is not asked to do much more.</li>
            <li> it should be better if the water flow could be controlled by pressure.</li>
            <li> But are better than nothing when traveling.</li>
            <li> More work than string flossing</li>
            <li> Requires some counter space (certainly more than a pack of string</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the waterpik, I have braces and using this</li>
            <li> Love it but does splash all over my sink</li>
            <li> I bought the newer handheld version and found that one charge lasts for many, many uses.  </li>
            <li> Would like more volume.</li>
            <li> but we love it and have one in all our bathrooms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product is OK.</li>
            <li> It has two pressure setting to which was OK.</li>
            <li> This design is also more ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also a much better electronic toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the best bang for your buck, especially if you&#x27;ve never used a liquid flosser before.  </li>
            <li> This is the best bang for your buck, especially if you&#x27;ve never used a liquid flosser before.  </li>
            <li> What I need, healthy teeth every day.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I almost feel goofy holding this monstrosity.</li>
            <li> The new Nano Sonic toothbrush is portable (great for traveling), easy to use, and does a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds charge okay and has nice water pressure to clean in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s like sticking a Dremel tool in your mouth, but that would be an insult to the fine tools by Dremel with which you can do very detailed work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked great for a couple months, great idea, however I&#x27;ve had trouble with battery life.</li>
            <li> Love it and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean and I&#x27;ve had  no mold issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IF cords are important, you might consider the counter top model.</li>
            <li> I love to travel and travel light.  </li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s small and handy; perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s small and handy; perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> it takes up a fair amount of premium bathroom-counter real estate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact in comparison to other ones I&#x27;ve seen and the best part is that it&#x27;s cordless</li>
            <li> That is a true bonus for me!  </li>
            <li> Not as many pressure settings as the original.</li>
            <li> device is great for travel (not too bulky, can be wrapped around your towel to prevent it from breaking) but if you primarily are just going to use it at home, get the Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser, which is 90 seconds instead of 45, 7 tips instead of 4, with 10 pressure settings instead of 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use</li>
            <li> summarize: it is great for travel or for a beginner, but better models do exist.nded up briefly trying his cord waterpik, and would have to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> The batteries last for many uses on a charge, so I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Below where you put the tip in, is the tip Rotator, turn that to get the tip in..fits in easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and maintain.</li>
            <li> They have kept my gums healthy and my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, it is easy to operate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more &#x27;fun&#x27; than string flossing and more</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> The water gets under and on the gums and between teeth, easily cleaning between teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> but it leaked and wasn&#x27;t easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s too hazardous to put Li-ION inside, but I really wish this device had more water pressure.</li>
            <li> variety of tips are nice and with some patience you can get a good cleaning, however unless you have a reason for needing a cordless unit, I would strongly recommend sticking with a standard, corded unit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, I filled the water reservoir (which you can also fill with mouthwash for a better clean) and turn on the devise.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is a good starter model for those who are new to water flossing or Waterpik.</li>
            <li> It really is comfortable and easy to hold and operate in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want the Waterpik flosser, fine.  </li>
            <li> and it does the job fine.  </li>
            <li> The unit work fine.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is huge.</li>
            <li> Works great now and we&#x27;ll see 5 months from now when I go back for my DDS appointment.</li>
            <li> Water irrigation is so important for oral care .</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this Waterpik and will continue to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This waterpik will make your teeth feel like you just came home from the dentist--clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great when it lasted - but very short life.</li>
            <li> Our bathroom water isn&#x27;t filtered, so warm tap water isn&#x27;t very tasty for us.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The included sonic toothbrush is fantastic</li>
            <li> I will happily use it as a travel Waterpik, when I always miss my big bulky buddy.  </li>
            <li> Even though there is a place to fill a tank with water, I found it to sit comfortably in my hand.</li>
            <li> Waterpic flossers fit it).  </li>
            <li> I also worried about how hygienic it was -- it wasn&#x27;t easy to drain the residual water or clean the interior of the device.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really great especially for those people that have braces.</li>
            <li> Also, there is no battery status indicator light.</li>
            <li> The nano-sonic toothbrush included is a nice bonus, especially if you decide you like that kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT, It replaced an older model i have had for years but finally quit working, this model is even better!</li>
            <li> After a few attempts, I was usually able to do a good job with this AND remembered to turn it off before taking it out of my mouth!</li>
            <li> The battery toothbrush that comes with it didn&#x27;t seem to be very useful at all, but it came with the waterpik, so why not.</li>
            <li> Very exciting -- although, perhaps, a bit wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think this version is very handy for travel, for people who are in the habit of using a water pik regularly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this awesome product, especially if you have braces.</li>
            <li> It is meant to be a lite version of the original Waterpik, which must be used with a cord.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it because of my braces</li>
            <li> which will cause non user/operation friendly (wires on the way</li>
            <li> Great product and long charge.</li>
            <li> Do you want cordless or clean teeth?  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the attachments yet, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with the regular spray tip.</li>
            <li> When my daughter got braces she had problems keeping them clean.</li>
            <li> oh so clean.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a way to clean all of my teeth where I don&#x27;t at some point have my drool running all over the unit.</li>
            <li> I like the size and the idea, but they don&#x27;t clean so well.  </li>
            <li> I have to refill it during use to clean all my teeth.</li>
            <li> I still floss, but this machine  has helped to push out debris and cut back on my plaque significantly, and as you can tell, I&#x27;m obsessive about good dental hygiene.    </li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t be sure of that, it certainly has that appearance.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure that I will one day get a deluxe model now that I&#x27;m on my second flosser, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this one particularly for the price and</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure that I will one day get a deluxe model now that I&#x27;m on my second flosser, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this one particularly for the price and</li>
            <li> It is a great improvement over the previous model, and it makes the task quick and easy.</li>
            <li> a great addition for travel, but a cord version has a bigger reservoir, more power, so for a few bucks more, you get more bang for your buck.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the bright side, I&#x27;m quite a big fan of the Nano Sonic Toothbrush that comes with the Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Aquarius model (newest model) and that has been working well for my not so beautifully arranged teeth because the Aquarius model includes various pressure settings, which is what I really need.</li>
            <li> Purchase the plug-in model with an adequate water reservoir if you want clean teeth.</li>
            <li> After you use it for a while you will be able to do your whole mouth without a need to refill.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, string flossing is still necessary, although this machine is a good supplement.  </li>
            <li> like I also have, but it is very convenient and does the trick for most cases.  </li>
            <li> Good size fluid tank.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel good hitting your eyes or even the back of your throat.  </li>
            <li> B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] which is getting kind of old</li>
            <li> It is also true that it doesn&#x27;t have the power of a plug in version.  </li>
            <li> Good for travel - the adapter says 120v only though.</li>
            <li> The full size counter-top model&lt;</li>
            <li> I have the full sized one in my bathroom; this stays in my suitcase for travel.  </li>
            <li> Ok it pulses water fast.</li>
            <li> This is a cool gadget that provides blasts of water to floss on a semi-professional level.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not up to par with a true powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You can use it with a more gentle stream if you&#x27;re sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The various tips do a good job at getting at the plaque and</li>
            <li> Second, it felt sooooo good on my gums that I didn&#x27;t want it to quit.</li>
            <li> I am a religious flosser, and so I wanted to see how good Waterpiks are.</li>
            <li> A fairly compact, easy to set-up and use, water flosser that includes a small battery powered toothbrush that I&#x27;ve come to love.    </li>
            <li> Besides, I&#x27;m a television and film actor, so I really should do it because it makes me look good on camera--and to me that&#x27;s money in the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this new version of Waterpik&#x27;s affordable model, I am flossing</li>
            <li> This Sonic Flosser is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Works very well on my teeth to get them nice and clean, works very well</li>
            <li> My dental checkups are super</li>
            <li> This is a super product.</li>
            <li> One learns quickly to keep the thing in your mouth or it becomes an formidable squirtgun.  </li>
            <li> so I was really hoping this device could make the routine more exciting and convenient.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions I charged it, filled up the water reservoir with luke warm water and started Niagara Falls in my mouth to the sink.</li>
            <li> I use it on high and wish it had even more force.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve informed them of the problem repeatedly, and even got them to replace that first one under warranty, but they&#x27;ve done nothing to fix this huge issue.  </li>
            <li> youngest son has enjoyed using this and in fact uses this longer than he would with his normal toothbrush and flossing.</li>
            <li> The description of this product says it has an &#x27;ergonomic&#x27; design and that it is ideal for use in small bathrooms or for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t agree it is ideal for small bathrooms and travel.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s not bad, but it is worth noting.</li>
            <li> This new version also includes the Nano Sonic Toothbrush which I&#x27;m also pleased</li>
            <li> Just love using my new Waterpik.</li>
            <li> The Nano Sonic toothbrush is great as it takes less energy to brush the teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> (The first time, I squirted water all over the mirror, though!)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably strong enough for most people though.</li>
            <li> Better stick to the simple and easy floss.</li>
            <li> it leave my teeth squeaky shiny clean, the way they feel when you first leave the dentist after a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the free electric brush and the Waterpik quickly became a daily habit.  </li>
            <li> I found, after a little practice, this cordless unit a great asset to my regimen.    </li>
            <li> I tested it in many ways and by golly, even after flossing I saw some fine particles of food following use of the pick.  </li>
            <li> real questions you have to decide is this: How important is it that you have a cordless waterpik?</li>
            <li> Better then the old style.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as powerful as the countertop models I have used.  </li>
            <li> The water flossing does work, though I feel I have more control with my old fashioned floss.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fun to use.  </li>
            <li> It holds about 45 seconds worth of water.  </li>
            <li> If you tip it too far to the side, it will not be able to shoot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is nice product, but there is not enough water pressure when using the PIK attachments.  </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> However, this might be my own personal preference.</li>
            <li> Recharging is required and refilling is also required even more frequently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Oral B model is too powerful.  </li>
            <li> I do like it better than my old Water Pic with the separate water tank and water wand.</li>
            <li> Toilet Tree has a better oral irrigator!</li>
            <li> It does burn through the water it holds pretty quickly, but I don&#x27;t know what else one would expect</li>
            <li> For best results the unit has to be held upright which is doable when flossing, however when trying to run water through to clean it, it&#x27;s difficult to hold the unit upright and get the water in the sink versus spraying everywhere.</li>
            <li> Works good but extremely noisy.</li>
            <li> instructions says to place in mouth right before turning it on, otherwise it will splash everywhere.</li>
            <li> The water power is just right.  </li>
            <li> Its water capacity is described as &amp;#34;45 seconds.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s right on the button.</li>
            <li> Third, the battery life is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> but if you want a very thorough clean, expect 4-6 refills.</li>
            <li> I truly believe it&#x27;s better than flossing, but i think it boils down to how skilled you are at it</li>
            <li> Fits nicely on small bathroom vanity and works great.</li>
            <li> So much better than old, large one.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning under the gum line is crucial, &amp; this is is great too especially  </li>
            <li> The Nano Sonic Toothbrush runs on a single AAA battery and fits nicely in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li> The Nano Sonic Toothbrush runs on a single AAA battery and fits nicely in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li> I put off buying one for a while, but I&#x27;m glad I finally got one.  </li>
            <li> However, this is the first time using one.</li>
            <li> First Waterpik</li>
            <li> This is my first oral irrigation system/waterpik.</li>
            <li> It has become my primary toothbrush and even when the head is old, I&#x27;ll probably replace it with another.  </li>
            <li> This is my first first Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I have used tiny, vibrating travel brushes like the cute one included.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I&#x27;d just rely on regular floss for a few days on a trip, then do a good thorough job at home with our counter-top model (which we love).</li>
            <li> Because I like to make sure I get all of the junk out, I fill it up twice, but that is just my personal preference.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to keep it charged up every day!  </li>
            <li> The first couple of uses</li>
            <li> , I want to say it lasted a month before it first need to recharge.</li>
            <li> This set works really well for cleaning around my son&#x27;s braces and he loves to use it!</li>
            <li> This is my first water flosser, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I would recommend try it first in the shower.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give you my tips for use below, but first, here are the pros and cons on this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable in your hand, and allows for a natural grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time this happened I contacted the company</li>
            <li> add and rotate various antibacterial mouth washes (mostly of the health food store variety) in the water.</li>
            <li> It would have been better if had a cord like the regular waterpik.</li>
            <li> The water lasts 55 seconds on the lower setting and 45 seconds on the higher setting.  </li>
            <li> If I flossed even once a week that would be meaningful to my dental health, and therefore my health overall.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Waterpik!</li>
            <li> It will likely be better for traveling.</li>
            <li> I splattered water and mouthwash all over my bathroom mirror and sink the first time I used this because I had no idea how to.</li>
            <li> Nano Sonic toothbrush as well is much better than the cheap Oral B models I had been using until now, and for a bonus, this one has a replaceable brush head, which means less plastic items in land fills and floating around in our oceans.this</li>

            <li> (I use a sonicare), and the ONLY way to clean back effectively there is with a Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li> Again, this is a good item to buy if you&#x27;re considering paying big money for a top of the line model, but not sure if you would use it yet.  </li>
            <li> is a good item to buy if you&#x27;re considering paying big money for a top of the line model, but not sure if you would use it yet.  </li>
            <li> As one gets older, it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> (Honestly, I could care less about the Nano Sonic Toothbrush that comes with it, but more on that later.)</li>
            <li> Overall it seems to work good enough</li>
            <li> With experimenting, bending over the sink in different head tilts, I&#x27;ve become quite good at hiiting back and front gumlines.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth and/or gums, or if you have nicely arranged teeth without any crooked ones, this might work well.</li>
            <li> It is very good but the pressure is not strong enough....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, available easily only on the web, and when used carefully it has been very safe and effective for us, with way less side effects than antibiotics and antivirals.</li>
            <li> This however does not have enough power and large enough reservoir for good dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> It may be me but the water does splash around a lot and my sink was pretty much lined with water after I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The higher speed does very well in removing debris.</li>
            <li> This unit might also be good for those with small bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is true that it doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the capacity that the tub style has, but I don&#x27;t understand why people would compare apples to oranges like that.  </li>
            <li> The big problem with this unit is that the rechargeable battery wears out very quickly and the switch drains the battery when it is off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I felt my teeth were so clean &amp; fresh in much shorter amount of time comparing to regular flossing ..</li>
            <li> The upside is - the overall product seems well made and easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li> I keep mine in the shower and find it easy to use daily.</li>
            <li> a single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is much better.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik will certainly sell you on the idea where the Oral B may not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Waterpik will certainly sell you on the idea where the Oral B may not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> system comes with four flossing heads; two standard, one with bristles, and one with a fine stream attachment.</li>
            <li> system comes with four flossing heads; two standard, one with bristles, and one with a fine stream attachment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still pretty big, but it&#x27;s much nicer than the original because you can just fill it up with water, use it, and then toss it under the sink.</li>
            <li> And I like the little vibrating toothbrush that comes free in the kit better than my clunky old Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on sink</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also very bulky, the panasonic one collapses , so</li>
            <li> This fixed that issue and she has fun using it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to store it empty with the cap off so mold doesn&#x27;t grow.  </li>
            <li> To much power for my gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no battery indicator, so you have to periodically charge since you can&#x27;t tell how much battery there is left.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do floss, but not always as much as I should.</li>
            <li> Really cleaned my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> question you must ask yourself is how much you are going to use a Waterpik, and how you are going to use it.</li>
            <li> It doesnt hold much liquid</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> The body is very bulky and clumbsy to use because of it&#x27;s size and shape.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t hold much water.</li>
            <li> Has the power, maybe too much.</li>
            <li> I like these so much</li>
            <li> However I just don&#x27;t see how this can really get the stuff out of between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the whole thing tips into the sink and send a tsunami of mouthwash-flavored water on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by this model.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li> So I really appreciate that my youngest son enjoys this waterpik.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really resembles a cell phone from the 80s, the type you see a character pull out in a period film</li>
            <li> I have tried both pressure settings and the harder pressure seems to do a better job</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much counter</li>
            <li> It goes through it really fast.</li>
            <li> In the way of convenience (its a task when your parneter wishes to use it and needs to change heads when everyone is in a rush to get ready.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> Does not look very durable.</li>
            <li> One of the tubes included came with the whole damage.</li>
            <li> how much battery remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> While it works gently on the gums and between teeth, thereâ€™s a trade off.</li>
            <li> so you have to throw the whole thing out.  </li>
            <li> Cleans gums very well</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much power, but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> so I really dont have a review of that.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t care what the picture shows of the correct use of the Flosser; in the real world, your arm and the Water Flosser are going to be drenched.)</li>
            <li> If you have the counter real estate, I say, go ahead and get the countertop version, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have some hygiene concerns about multiple people using the device, even though each person can have his or her own personal tips.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just kind of messy to use.</li>
            <li> Of course, the time you remember that it needs to be recharged is right after you use it, and getting all of the water out of that hole is near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can direct the water stream right at the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> There are only two pressure settings, but unless you always have to do high pressure, the two settings included in this unit works fine.</li>
            <li> Even though the reservoir holds enough for only one use, it is quick and easy to refill.  </li>
            <li> The other question you need to ask yourself is do you want more than 45 seconds of time to waterpik or can you use it and not tip it sideways?&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay the current price for it (around $45 on Amazon) unless I had a significant need for this type of device and would be traveling for an extended period of time</li>
            <li> The waterpik comes with 2 power settings (a high and low setting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a huge learning curve in the beginning.</li>
            <li> You can only clean one or two teeth per refill</li>
            <li> is the only way to keep them clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Great for Travel,</li>
            <li> Not bad, but it runs out of water fast, requiring several refills during a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it with success knocking out colds and viruses in hours, quickly reversing lung and sinus infections, reversing a severe infection that may have had MRSA from a bug bite without pharmaceutical antibiotics that had my entire thigh swollen and oozing and my doctors freaked out, and I was completely cured from rosacea (which has no cure according to mainstream doctors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But even the high pressure didn&#x27;t really seem to do a lot.  </li>
            <li> Nice small head that gets around my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> First and foremost this Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser does the job.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a smaller full sized electric toothbrush-</li>
            <li> So not sure how effective it is doing that.</li>
            <li> I have gotten almost two full weeks of once-a-day use out of it from only one charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This waterpik comes with great attachments and is small enough to live on my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> ok but kind of awkward to use</li>
            <li> WAY better than the former portable model,  Bigger capacity, easier to fill and the charge lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve become quite proficient at it and can now do a decent cleaning with one water fill.    </li>
            <li> The flosser is fairly decent, with the limitations listed above.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This in is basically the same thing but handheld and smaller, which is much better.</li>
            <li> Because of the limited size of the water reservoir you get only 30-45 seconds of flossing per fill, but the reservoir is very easy to fill.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone shopping for a Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so he suggested this which he highly recommended...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the wired versions if you have the space.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this Waterpik if you have gum issues or if you wish to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this Waterpik if you have gum issues or if you wish to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive but of high quality.</li>
            <li> Stopped working in high setting after three months.</li>
            <li> It does the job, although I wish it had a little more power.  </li>
            <li> The water in the reservoir in the wireless runs out fast and you need to refill frequently.  </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as their larger, stationary model.</li>
            <li> I am assuming it works wonders in places where it works, which doesn&#x27;t include the places I normally travel to.)</li>
            <li> you first use the water flosser, the 45 second water capacity will not finish your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s powerful and the bristles actually rotate that I take in</li>
            <li> and you laugh because it looks so big and bulky compared to what we have know.</li>
            <li> (more than just a few days).  </li>
            <li> Works as expected, minimal directions included but sufficient, so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but if I get 5 years out of it I&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Knowing well in advance that I was in for 45 second of arm-drenching, I concentrated on the most sensitive areas in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is this: if you want a starter Waterpik, this model is a good one; if you need a Waterpik with more pressure settings and various tips for specific purposes--in my case, the pressure setting and tip for users with periodontal disease--I strongly recommend one to consider purchasing the Aquarius model; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The water does empty quickly because the reservoir is smaller than the full size (fill it up 4 or 5 tines for each flossing.but</li>
            <li> However, after trying this model several times, I was less thrilled with the battery powered water pressure.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t give me a thorough enough, or strong enough</li>
            <li> I read the simple instructions, and got going right away.  </li>
            <li> While she is determined to continue using this cordless waterpik even though it messes up the bathroom sink, I on the other hand think that the mess to clean up after myself after using it to be more of a hassle.</li>
            <li> That said, the 7 oz. reservoir still isn&#x27;t big enough to clean my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think this will inspire me to floss any more regularly, but I do like the clean feeling I have after a quick session</li>
            <li> An odd failure, given that the portable one seems ideal for travel.  </li>
            <li> If you are traveling and really want to have a water flossing machine with you, this is certainly smaller than a counter-top machine, and seems to work about as well (standard attachments for the newest models of full size</li>
            <li> I bought this brand because my other Waterpik tips will fit on it.  </li>
            <li> This slightly updated version is just as powerful as the first one, holds just as much water, holds its charge for up to two weeks (so far), _and_ includes a battery-powered toothbrush as a bonus.  </li>
            <li> I get a new one of these about every two years.  </li>
            <li> all looks just as a scam to buy a new charger for 9 dollars</li>
            <li> Charging battery now to try out me new gadget.</li>
            <li> This one I&#x27;m reviewing is new, and it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.</li>
            <li> This new one has a NIMH battery</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a big thumbs up for me, and I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li> This unit is almost identical to a Waterpik Cordless that I already own - as far as I can tell the only changes made on this model are a different plug for the A/C adapter and the color of the water tank (used to be blue, now clear).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering how long the charge lasts, and that the waterpik is reasonably small, I think this was a good</li>
            <li> And I was very surprised to receive an electric toothbrush as part of the package.</li>
            <li> They suggest starting with the lower intensity I (1), but that didn&#x27;t seem to do very much at all.</li>
            <li> They suggest starting with the lower intensity I (1), but that didn&#x27;t seem to do very much at all.</li>
            <li> I was going to let my younger kids use it, until I made a huge mess the first time; I think I&#x27;ll wait until they are older.</li>
            <li> Powerful and battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The force of the water is another issue, especially on the higher setting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When starting to use this,  Put the tips in your mouth first, then close your lips around it,  then turn it on,  </li>
            <li> This is my second one, the first could not be charged twice.</li>
            <li> When I finally got the hang of it, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Too strong messy and not eas y to regulate water pressure&lt;</li>
            <li> Would you buy a Smart car and later complain that it did not seat 8?  </li>
            <li> I had deep pockets around my back teeth, and I am sure I would loose some if I had not had this recommended to me by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> a powerful stream but would not able to clean as well as traditional flosser.</li>
            <li> In waited too long to be able to return an item that was not useful at all.  </li>
            <li> Clearly that would be silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really want to like it, but the battery stop charging after 3 months of constant use (once per day).</li>
            <li> Within 90 days this just completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li> OTOH, I&#x27;ve owned and been dissatisfied with the old portable model and spotted this one as I was ordering something else on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The lower power might still cause you some discomfort in the beginning if your gums are sensitive.</li>
            <li> Refilling requires turning off the machine completely.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by how well this works.</li>
            <li> I also have the non professional version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been an old fashioned floss guy.  </li>
            <li> And after using the Waterpik for about 2 weeks, I think I&#x27;m going to remain an old fashioned floss</li>
            <li> Couple that with the space it takes up and the &#x27;maintenance&#x27; required in it, I&#x27;ll just stick to old fashioned floss.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give a cordless a shot, however it&#x27;s no where near as convenient.</li>
            <li> But as far as use...</li>
            <li> When I was getting too close to my gums the thing would stall out completely.</li>
            <li> I use it to floss frequently since I just got braces.  </li>
            <li> just wow</li>
            <li> I wonder if I&#x27;d have to order them from Waterpik directly?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It runs on a AAA battery and seems to last a reasonable length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> There are 2 speeds, start with lower speed; it&#x27;s forceful and gums can be sensitive,    </li>
            <li> With portability comes natural tradeoffs.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a compact form so it can only hold so much water.</li>
            <li> A coworker bought the non-professional version of this, and as far as I can tell there is no functional difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve completely reversed the gum pockets, infection and inflammation using the Waterpick and adding some antibacterials to the water.</li>
            <li> I had to refill 2~3 times to complete one water flossing.</li>
            <li> Only if you really want something cordless.  </li>
            <li> There are much smaller, lighter, and better water flossing wands out there, but they cost at least four times as much.  </li>
            <li> There are much smaller, lighter, and better water flossing wands out there, but they cost at least four times as much.  </li>
            <li> The old one stopped holding a charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, when I saw the Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser, I jumped at it.</li>
            <li> If it had a bigger reservoir it would weigh more (water is heavy) and then it would be bulky to use.  </li>
            <li> Here is where the full size counter-top model excels - you only have to hold the pik attachment itself on its long, flexible tubing, and you can get it to any angle with virtually no weight or bulk in your hand (unlike this cordless model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is good for travel or casual home use.  </li>
            <li> , there is no charging light, indicating either that it needs charging, or that charging is complete (or if there is one, it is considerably well hidden!  </li>
            <li> But it does not produce the same water pressure as many other models, especially the corded models.  </li>
            <li> the cordless version there are obvious engineering disadvantages, one that you have to fit in a small form factor, therefore can&#x27;t keep nearly as much water in the reservoir, and you don&#x27;t have an unlimited power supply from the wall</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy &amp; easy to spill.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It will take multiple refills of the reservoir per use to do a decent job of flossing.  </li>
            <li> used an old countertop waterpik model from the 70s as a child, I was aware about what they were about, but living in an old NYC apartment with a small bathroom with no counter space, the large model was out of the question to my wife.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I suggest using it on low for a week or two while your gums get used to it before using on high.</li>
            <li> really, strength of the water was exactly the same and the battery didn&#x27;t last long , I used it twice and was already dead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The high setting on this unit produces about same pressure as 5 on the Aquarius.</li>
            <li> of water blasts out of the Pik in two settings (low and high).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the power isn&#x27;t as high as the waterpik I used as a kid, it is enough to get the job done, I just have to fill the reservoir 2-3 times (as I only use the high setting)&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> Very messy to use, better off getting regular plug in model.</li>
            <li> Then there&#x27;s the noise this thing puts out: it sounds like the motor is dying, which is no big deal (as that&#x27;s just the sound it makes), but I found it an odd noise.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier model,  but after a couple years of use the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge beyond two or three days; that is normal for rechargeable batteries of all types, of course.  </li>
            <li> if you can afford the larger Waterpik with the large tank, I suggest that for Daily use and this for travel!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers complain of how quickly it runs out of water but refilling it is so simple that I don&#x27;t see how there is any concern there.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s certainly quite a bit smaller than a traditional water flosser with a tank, it&#x27;s not small enough to be portable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel this was actually cleaning my gums very well and will stick to traditional flossing.</li>
            <li> Lastly, there isn&#x27;t a charge meter on it to let you know when the unit is ready to be unplugged; again, not a big deal, but it makes conserving energy and extending battery life easier when you have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suspect much of the controversy about it is because it can&#x27;t be patented and it competes with many expensive drugs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model still works well for a quick and gentle water flossing, but this Waterpik is not nearly as superior as the Aquarius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This unit is large and not very maneuverable.</li>
            <li> There appear to be only 2 pressure settings, low and high.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed this to my boyfriend who has the cord Waterpik version and his general advice can be summed up to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews, some people don&#x27;t like this unit or, perhaps, are unsure of Waterpiks in general.  </li>
            <li> Also likes the bonus toothbrush that came with it. :O)</li>
            <li> The third one (the Professional model)</li>
            <li> one thing that I would warn any purchaser is that you really have to be careful how you hold that machine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the big gun and the antibacterial that completely reversed my gum problems is an antibacterial/antiviral/antifungal called MMS (This stands for Miracle Mineral Supplement).</li>
            <li> This replaced an old Waterpik flosser I had for several years.  </li>
            <li> Alas, I was all the way to checkout when I decided to make sure that the charger was useable in Europe.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet mastered how to consistently keep the water from running down my arm, but I&#x27;m getting there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, and I believe this new one is just slightly lighter than the older one I was using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very anxious to see if I have a better report when I get my teeth cleaned at the dentist next month and will report back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you want to make a huge mess, you need to keep your mouth closed around the tip.  </li>
            <li> The tank holds enough water for me to do my entire mouth on low, and on high I may need 1-2 tanks (it depends).  </li>
            <li> AND this price is way less than what I can order it directly from Waterpik!!!!</li>
            <li> I just used it for one time then the battery started to run out so fast ( for like 10 sec ) and it stops working !</li>
            <li> I was reluctant of it making a mess at first.</li>
            <li> Even with the slightly larger tank completely full, and though the overall design is about the same size, it seems lighter than the previous model.  </li>
            <li> And the unit is big despite having only a modest size water reservoir.  </li>
            <li> The description read like they had finally gotten a useful portable, and since we&#x27;re headed for Spain in a few days, I decided to buy.  </li>
            <li> With any stretch of the imagination I couldn&#x27;t expect a more poorly designed dental appliance to be sold on the open market.</li>
            <li> My first one (the Plus model) basically fried the battery with green foam pouring out of the charging slot.  </li>
            <li> It can and will be messy when you first use it.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice to get to the point where you don&#x27;t spray all over the mirror, but even then it&#x27;s pretty messy.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it blasted out food particles; which is its primary job.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush it ships with is pretty lame; not vey powerful...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s being poorly position easy to accidently bump the switch</li>
            <li> The power ran down completely after only one use and it held slightly less fluid than was needed to make it through a single flossing--so it needed to be recharged after each use and filled twice for</li>
            <li> It is &#x27;easier&#x27; than flossing in that you don&#x27;t have to open your mouth all weird and angle string funny, but it&#x27;s also more work between the water refills and cleaning up the watery mess afterwards.</li>
            <li> Small and just right for a personal waterpik</li>
            <li> I fully understand that sonic toothbrushes are designed for minimal pressure on teeth (not hard brushing back and forth like an inexpensive traditional manual toothbrush).  </li>
            <li> Instead of getting out to refill half way through, I just learned to get through my entire mouth much quicker.</li>
            <li> I only use high, not sure why anyone would use the low setting (maybe for sensitive areas?).</li>
            <li> It can be very messy at first, which is why I understand why the maker includes that &amp;#34;STOP and call us before returning&amp;#34</li>
            <li> would very much like to recommend this product due to the ease of flossing, but at the same time am mindful that it does comes with some slight hassle.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long the machine last, and, perhaps, I&#x27;ll try it on the next trip.</li>
            <li> I have had a waterpik in the past that needed to be plugged into the wall and operated from a large water reservoir that sat on the counter.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Waterpik, floss is ineffective, hard to use, time consuming and requires too much self-discipline for me!  </li>
            <li> If you have limited space and don&#x27;t want to buy the larger corded version, this is a solid option.</li>
            <li> what was apparently its mechanical twin, and spent quite a bit of time trying to push the control button on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that after a long while, the units have started leaking.</li>
            <li> Yet just that much &amp;#34;restriction&amp;#34; from the user&#x27;s lips on the movement of the brush is enough to stop the brush entirely, or slow it down to where its action is relativelyuseless.  </li>
            <li> As a result, it&#x27;s difficult to use this nearly as effectively as a standard corded model, and without making a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it flossers anywhere near what a typical floss would.</li>
            <li> this is simply not even remotely in the same class.  </li>
            <li> This travel set is not nearly as good as the regular large waterpik and a regular sonic brush.  </li>
            <li> The motor looked the same as the Aquarius&#x27;, but because this unit uses battery power, I guess the pressure this can produce is limited.</li>
            <li> for the included toothbrush, it is a tiny sonic-style toothbrush powered by a single AAA battery.  </li>
            <li> While I like the concept of a water flosser, I was surprised of the mess I made while using this flosser.</li>
            <li> this unit has strange reaction after charge, sometime the water force is strong but sometime is weak like got half charge.</li>
            <li> My other electric toothbrush comes with a big travel carrier, but it&#x27;s too big and bulky.</li>
            <li> My other electric toothbrush comes with a big travel carrier, but it&#x27;s too big and bulky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, Waterpik doesn&#x27;t seem to have any interest in fixing the problem, as they done nothing but a minor redesign over the course of 6+ years.  </li>
            <li> it is a complete waste of money ..</li>
            <li> The design seems strange.</li>
            <li> When you recharge it, there is really no where for the extra cord to go.</li>
            <li> But while using it, the user&#x27;s mouth needs to stay closed so that tiny droplets of toothpaste-filled water aren&#x27;t scattered all over your sink and mirror area.  </li>
            <li> drops of activated MMS in my Waterpik water a few times a week completely reversed the gum issues, and I do a once a week application for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the periodontal tip has a smaller opening and it seemed to make the motor work a lot harder</li>
            <li> I think it will work for travel although it&#x27;s larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many times I could have done that before the charge failed, but since I have to stop every 45 seconds to refill it with water, I have the patience for only a few refills.</li>
            <li> Has solid pros and no real cons.</li>
            <li> A drawback is, you have to hold it upright for the water to come out properly, so it&#x27;s dripping back out your mouth and down your hand and the flosser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a major improvement from the previous cordless Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Big improvement over previous models, this is the third one from Amazon, but it is twice the price.</li>
            <li> I have never used the larger corded model Waterpik, but I can&#x27;t imagine using a Waterpik with a stronger jet than this one - as it is I typically leave the unit on its low setting and have no issues getting all of the gunk out of my teeth, and i have never considered this underpowered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am not consistent enough with it to tell over long run.</li>
            <li> The included booklet talks about other attachments (like a tongue-cleaner) that didn&#x27;t come with my unit, but I can&#x27;t find them in my local Walmart.  </li>
            <li> The thing I did not like is when using it, the water jet would splatter outside due to the pressure hitting the teeth.  </li>
            <li> wife who does not floss using string as she deems it too painful was in fact the first to use this cordless waterpik as she feels that it will be painless and commented that she splashed water over herself using it the first time.</li>
            <li> We really wanted to like this, but I&#x27;m afraid it just doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> Anyone have a suggestion where to put them , as they should dry..</li>
            <li> Anyway, prior to getting this water flosser, I was only flossing a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I brush twice daily (at least), floss frequently, use an anti-plaque rinse, and a nightly flouride swish and spit.  </li>
            <li> First, the unit needs to charge for 24 hours with the small plug-in ac box and narrow cord.  </li>
            <li> Be warned though, it can be very messy the first few times until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> The first few times the water flew all over!!!  </li>
            <li> Every single person can benefit from this</li>
            <li> This Waterpik, in my opinion, is just too limited for what it can do.</li>
            <li> There is a single detachable brush for the Nano Sonic Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> As a result, a small tank requires frequent refills.</li>
            <li> The fundamental flaw with the product is that the charging receptacle is down at the bottom where it gets soaked with water, all the way back into the recesses of the receptacle.  </li>
            <li> and when you do hold it at the correct angle, you&#x27;re likely to have water running down your arm.</li>
            <li> Because it is fairly big, it seems a little unwieldy and strange.</li>
            <li> I will never use it as I can&#x27;t stand this style of toothbrush (I prefer rotating heads like on Oral-B products), and it is really too small for everyday home use.  </li>
            <li> They are fairly easy to insert, but a little difficult to get out.</li>
            <li> It has to be refilled with water half way through, which is inconvenient but better than a tank on the vanity.</li>
            <li> There is a single detachable brush for the Nano Sonic Toothbrush.ill it with water, I have the patience for only a few refills.</li>
            <li> This unit has very limited power and water capacity.</li>
            <li> This water flosser is a little larger; the on-off button took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The extra vibrating toothbrush thing is pretty useless other than a noise making toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You can use it with your mouth open, of course, but be prepared to make a little mess.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Then, chose your pick and insert; open the little side portal and fill with lukewarm water,</li>
            <li> I know I should floss, I know how to floss, and when I&#x27;m done flossing I feel great, but the string method is uncomfortable and inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> i need to refill it twice to finish the flossing, otherwise works as expected</li>
            <li> Product is heavy, not balanced properly and a challenge to navigate thru the mouth.</li>
            <li> As is I usually only get a few uses out of a Waterpik before a recharge is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is portable but it&#x27;s awkward to use because you have to keep it up right for the water to feed properly.</li>
            <li> I prefer the compact size due to limited counter space &amp; the fact that I don&#x27;t travel without it!</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this for people who are unwilling or unable to use regular floss.  </li>
            <li> It was a great disappointment when the product failed to charge up after I used it for less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on I; go to II and while you don&#x27;t get the fire hose blast that some prefer, you get enough water jet speed to knock out hidden food particles between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on I; go to II and while you don&#x27;t get the fire hose blast that some prefer, you get enough water jet speed to knock out hidden food particles between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems a bit underpowered, but other reviews indicated that as well.  </li>
            <li> (When finished, empty the water out by Shaking it !)  </li>
            <li> I also expected the water to come out stronger then what it did.!</li>
            <li> have never used a WaterPic or other flosser before, so I didn&#x27;t quite know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I opted for the wireless route due to the fact that i wanted to take up the minimalist amount of space in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Small water reservoir requires multiple refills for one flossing</li>
            <li> I used to floss in about 15 minutes because of the threading with floss due to having braces</li>
            <li> so it will not develop the memory effect the other one did with its NICAD battery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now the other.</li>
            <li> Lastly, when using the device, the unit always has to be used straight up when water flossing; one cannot tilt it or use it horizontally, which is can be quite inconvenient, depending on the user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small water reservoir.</li>
            <li> But its construction makes it very difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this because I hate to floss the regular way, even though I know everyone should do it.  </li>
            <li> Also, the opening to the water reservoir is very small and is positioned where you can&#x27;t just dump the water out but must tilt it back and forth to empty.</li>
            <li> Because this model is cordless, it might have been difficult to put a large tank.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time feeling the difference between the different attachments.</li>
            <li> Although the unit itself is little bit bulky to hold in one hand (especially if you have small hands), it is still cordless and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is certainly not a powerful as a countertop Waterpik</li>
            <li> This cordless version of the waterpik is certainly not as powerful as the corded versions, like the Waterpik Ultra</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> have both praise and boos for the device which has lead me to give it a so-so average rating.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it  , not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle</li>
            <li> , I got this item twice for space saving and travel, a little awkward to use and the tank runs out of water quickly.  </li>
            <li> Some of the pictures show the tip facing in opposite directions from each other, which is a little confusing.  </li>
            <li> Water runs down my arm if I hold it upright.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve gotten it down to a science now...</li>
            <li> BUT it is not easy to completely empty it.  </li>
            <li> That setting was  uncomfortable for me, and I now use only the low power flow.  </li>
            <li> Less drill and fill.  </li>
            <li> This helps the on the go person to keep a cleaner mouth and less hassle.</li>
            <li> but now I floss in less than three minutes.</li>
            <li> This model is about half price for what I paid on the Aquarius model, yet Iâ€™d still recommend the Aquarius model (or the Ultra model) over this model.</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed before this thing failed to last more than 6 months was how badly underpowered it was.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the trouble</li>
            <li> A mess as there is water all over , trying to aim for the water hole, even though your doing it in the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> It was still a dripping mess..</li>
            <li> This means that the waste water tends to run down over the unit, or my arm, or ...&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Then I thought about bad lucky, but the second one has not good pressure at all.</li>
            <li> The hard to reach spaces between the reservoir and the body will develop mildew over time if not kept dry.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was less messy for me.</li>
            <li> This one is a little bulky to hold but it works the way it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> The changed the shape of the receptacle a little bit a couple of years ago, but that&#x27;s all they&#x27;ve done, and it didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavier tho.</li>
            <li> it takes a little getting use to.</li>
            <li> I also add a little mouth wash to the reservoir.</li>
            <li> It comes with an adjustment for water delivery when using so it doesn&#x27;t produce too harsh or too little of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The water reservoir is larger, but the directions said to empty it between uses (don&#x27;t let stale water sit in the flosser).  </li>
            <li> Maybe we used it wrong somehow, but we read the instructions and they seemed clear.  </li>
            <li> Also a bit messy, so</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s not available in my country</li>
            <li> , I made some search to know that you should not let the battery goes completely dead,</li>
            <li> Takes a few times to get the hang of it and not saturate your sink area.  </li>
            <li> or so it is still somewhat messy.  </li>
            <li> Will work just for travel use---not an everyday item.</li>
            <li> The one thing I have to say though is the reservoir is difficult to completely fill with the opening at the bottom.</li>
            <li> have my 6 month dental checkup in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I wrapped it around the unit a few times, to keep it out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> A bit messy, but guess they all are.  </li>
            <li> I found this messy to use -- if you don&#x27;t hold the device at the correct angle, water goes everywhere</li>
            <li> (Research by doing a google search of MMS and Jim Humble, and decide for yourself.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> apparently the provided charger is limited to 120 V (how weak that could be?!!)</li>
            <li> The water dispenser is also difficult to clean, really difficult.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the water reservoir is a little small.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the switch is badly designed as not to shut off when released.</li>
            <li> Is a little hard on your gums.  </li>
            <li> again, the Waterpik isn&#x27;t bad, but for me its just a bit much.  </li>
            <li> Waterpik flosser was recommended by my dentist as traditional flossing is difficult with my braces.</li>
            <li> Amazon let me return it even though it was past 30 days.  </li>
            <li> Product came with small crack....</li>
            <li> that caused a small leak.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the water reservoir is a bit small</li>
            <li> The water cavity is small and may need to be refilled to finish the job</li>
            <li> The small plug fits in at the side at the bottom of the waterpik    </li>
            <li> and maybe I just can&#x27;t see the gunk because it&#x27;s too small.  </li>
            <li> It makes it difficult to see what you&#x27;re doing on back teeth.  </li>
            <li> Usually require two refills per use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of its effectiveness either.</li>
            <li> I have fillings that make flossing at the back of my mouth difficult.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will, and I suspect in the past it may be because of one of the antibacterials I&#x27;ve added to the water that&#x27;s on the acidic side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually Waterpik, then floss, then brush, then mouthwash), but I appreciate the element the Waterpik brings to my dental hygiene regiment.</li>
            <li> The low setting is useless.</li>
            <li> water supply is too small for thorough cleaning&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Can be very messy.</li>
            <li> It is just very messy.  </li>
            <li> product design is not too bad, but the unit is bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The amount of water that this cordless water flosser can handle is also a disappointment as I have to refill it at least 4 times before I feel that my teeth is completely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When we filled it with cold water, it was a little painful on the gums.  </li>
            <li> Small water reservoir, I need to fill it at least twice during my cleaning.</li>
            <li> What makes it worse is the fact that you can&#x27;t turn it on it&#x27;s side or upside down because the water flow will stop.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this, but I&#x27;m disappointed!    </li>
            <li> flow is a little weak.</li>
            <li> Hard to learn to use.</li>
            <li> TOO late to return.</li>
            <li> one complaint on this unit is the battery</li>
            <li> Messy with poor performance,  I would not buy again.  </li>
            <li> Also due to the fact that it splashes over, my wife literally sticks the flosser into her mouth making it almost impossible for me to use it due to hygiene</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very difficult to get to the back side of the lower teeth unless you&#x27;ve just refilled it, because as the reservoir empties with the unit tilted toward 90Â°</li>
            <li> This makes it messy and difficult to control rather than push to use and release for shut off.</li>
            <li> messy, water flow is difficult to handle with one hand&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I still have no problem holding this Waterpik in one hand and doing water flossing, yet I have to admit that it feels slightly awkward compared to the other corded model.</li>
            <li> This is a product in desperate, desperate need of a major overhaul.  </li>
            <li> drips water while using, very clumsy to use.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little awkward to have to hold it vertical</li>
            <li> But the thing shouldn&#x27;t have completely broken after 90 days.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush it came with seems alright, but not great.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Panasonic version for a while and was tired of having to take out the batteries to charge, so I decided to buy this one which is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not happy.  </li>
            <li> When it does it will take a thin cleaning object (I used a toothpick) to scrape the mildew off.  </li>
            <li> I am sort of addicted to it.</li>
            <li> COuld be better,could be worse</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> the gums behind the wisdom teeth can&#x27;t even be cleaned with floss OR</li>
            <li> we actually broke one of the tips, because it was inadvertently knocked off the bathroom sink, and I had to use scissors to pull the broken base out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t come with a base, but the unit has a flat bottom.</li>
            <li> Very weak stream.</li>
            <li> This is a little annoying.  </li>
            <li> I hate using the string, and when I try to use the little pick things they always break.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush is useless.</li>
            <li> worst of all, we just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it to floss properly.  </li>
            <li> Select your tips, and there are a few, but I think there worthless.</li>
            <li> Needs a 24 hour charge before using and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have a charge level indicator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the included toothbrush is almost useless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;TOOTHBRUSH: I had been using Oral B electronic toothbrushes with guilty conscience because when an Oral B&#x27;s brush head wears out it&#x27;s not replaceable</li>
            <li> I am horrible at religiously flossing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Too bad it didn&#x27;t even last for a another use .. DISAPPOINTED !!!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, trying to plug it in to charge it has very bad consequences if you don&#x27;t get all of the water out of that hole, which is hard to do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to treat with kid gloves, which has been very inconvenient and frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Its inconvenient to have to refill it 6-8 times for one use.  </li>
            <li> This waterpik is A bit awkward.    </li>
            <li> I should mention that using cold water in the flosser can hurt</li>
            <li> Using it is quite awkward for me.</li>
            <li> After an hour&#x27;s charge, I flipped the &amp;#34;intensity&amp;#34; switch to II (2) and blasted away for 45 seconds.</li>
            <li> The hassle of returning and paying for shipment made it a bad buying experience.</li>
            <li> Bad switch, bad shape, no service life.</li>
            <li> I plaque like crazy, especially behind the lower front incisors.  </li>
            <li> matter which option you choose, you wont be disappointed with the results</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of a water flosser before, and since I hate flossing as well as the lectures about the need to floss whenever I see the dentist, I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.&amp;#34; However, I so detest the necessity of string flossing, that I kept testing up.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it and easy to use. Wil ask my dental hygienist at my next appointment if she notices a difference.</li>
            <li> Two outstanding products wrapped  into a nice package. Good for teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Product meets expectations,,, wish it was a bit more forcefull...&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it truly makes a difference or not ?</li>
            <li> Good replacement for the series with the rechargeable toothbrush.  The toothbrush it ships with is pretty lame; not vey powerful... the flosser is identical to the 900 series unit.</li>
            <li> I put off buying one for a while, but I&#x27;m glad I finally got one.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months &amp; I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it! The tank holds enough water for me to do my entire mouth on low, and on high I may need 1-2 tanks (it depends).  No big deal to refill, &amp; I prefer the compact size due to limited counter space &amp; the fact that I don&#x27;t travel without it! I highly recommend.  Tip: I suggest using it on low for a week or two while your gums get used to it before using on high.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel this was actually cleaning my gums very well and will stick to traditional flossing.</li>
            <li> I really want to like it, but the battery stop charging after 3 months of constant use (once per day). I&#x27;m likely to replace it with the Panasonic Oral Irrigator which uses the replaceable AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Try effectively cleaning your teeth in 45 seconds.  It can&#x27;t be done effectively.  You can only clean one or two teeth per refill and you&#x27;ll find yourself sending more time refilling the machine than using it.  90% of your time will be holding this Waterpik uner the faucet refilling it.  Do you want cordless or clean teeth?  You can&#x27;t have both with this model.  Purchase the plug-in model with an adequate water reservoir if you want clean teeth. A toothpick is more effective as this model.</li>
            <li> It works great, and its lite weight. Hope my dental checkups will be better than ever.</li>
            <li> Works great now and we&#x27;ll see 5 months from now when I go back for my DDS appointment.</li>
            <li> Love the flosser. However, this is the first time using one. Followed the instructions but the water seems to &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; or dripped on my arms. So i try closing my mouth while using it for each section. And problem solved :)</li>
            <li> waterpik is good at flosser but Philips&#x27; toothbrush is much more better than this one.</li>
            <li> Purchase for my son with a permanent orthodontic retainer.  He loves it and said it works great.  Also likes the bonus toothbrush that came with it. :O)</li>
            <li> waterpik works great. Toothbrush head broke off after third use.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to take on a trip, and though it is not as forceful as the one I have at home, it did the job nicely, I can&#x27;t do without my waterpik so this is a good way to take it with on the plane.  My dental checkups are super so it is a win, win.  Helps keep the pricy dental work at bay.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is very good but the pressure is not strong enough....</li>
            <li> Not bad, but it runs out of water fast, requiring several refills during a cleaning.  Also a bit messy, so not something I pick up to use daily. Seems a bit underpowered, but other reviews indicated that as well.  Overall it seems to work good enough but I am not consistent enough with it to tell over long run.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on sink</li>
            <li> Water runs down my arm if I hold it upright.  It seems like it needs more power.  I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing a great job. I run out of water before I&#x27;m done.  I like the toothbrush though!  Nice small head that gets around my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> Oh my! First Waterpik I ever purchased and I love it! It&#x27;s compact in comparison to other ones I&#x27;ve seen and the best part is that it&#x27;s cordless and I can take it with me when traveling. I haven&#x27;t used all the attachments yet, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with the regular spray tip. This also comes with a battery-operated toothbrush.  I highly recommend this product to anyone shopping for a Waterpik.</li>
            <li> This is certainly not a powerful as a countertop Waterpik but it is great for travel.</li>
            <li> I get a new one of these about every two years.  They work wonders if you have ever had gum problems.  My dentist recommended it years ago and I&#x27;ve used Waterpiks since then.  This one is a little bulky to hold but it works the way it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Excellent. that&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
            <li> charger stopped to work after 2 months...it says AC to AC chgarger on label which is not possible...all looks just as a scam to buy a new charger for 9 dollars</li>
            <li> Arrived as shown. Works great. Better then the old style.</li>
            <li> I love Waterpik products.  This is good for travel or casual home use.  Not as powerful as their larger, stationary model.</li>
            <li> a powerful stream but would not able to clean as well as traditional flosser.</li>
            <li> I think it would be better if the water blast was stronger</li>
            <li> Works well. I love the brush :)</li>
            <li> Waterpik flosser was recommended by my dentist as traditional flossing is difficult with my braces. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not available in my country and I had to order it from US, but it was not charging, I made some search to know that you should not let the battery goes completely dead, thought this was the issue and it was just easier to order another one. I was still having the same issue and only then I found out that it&#x27;s because of the different voltage in my country. If your country voltage us 220 you will need a voltage converter or maybe ordering the UK version from amazon UK. I have recommended this to my family and friends and we all just love it.</li>
            <li> So much better than old, large one.  Fits nicely on small bathroom vanity and works great.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as a plug in water flosser, but still very good.</li>
            <li> This item exceeded my expectations.  It is a great improvement over the previous model, and it makes the task quick and easy.</li>
            <li> This is a major improvement from the previous cordless Waterpik. If you have limited space and don&#x27;t want to buy the larger corded version, this is a solid option.</li>
            <li> Within 90 days this just completely stopped working.  I took care of it.  I tried charging it overnight.  Nothing.  Amazon let me return it even though it was past 30 days.  But the thing shouldn&#x27;t have completely broken after 90 days.</li>
            <li> This only holds enough water for  5-10 seconds of waterpiking.  Its inconvenient to have to refill it 6-8 times for one use.  Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as powerful as the countertop models I have used.  The toothbrush it came with seems alright, but not great.</li>
            <li> Product came with small crack....that caused a small leak. Not noticed in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;when leak increased a couple of weeks later......TOO late to return. Product was that great anyway.</li>
            <li> Good noisy drips a bit</li>
            <li> Love it!  I bought it because I have braces and it&#x27;s invaluable. Takes a few times to get the hang of it and not saturate your sink area.  I&#x27;m even taking it on vacation.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Panasonic version for a while and was tired of having to take out the batteries to charge, so I decided to buy this one which is rechargeable. I thought that Waterpik that have been doing this for ages would have a stronger and better product than panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;Not really, strength of the water was exactly the same and the battery didn&#x27;t last long , I used it twice and was already dead.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very bulky, the panasonic one collapses , so it&#x27;s easy to carry. I personally didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it flossers anywhere near what a typical floss would. We use both every night. We basically use it to rinse the mouth after flossing with regular floss. I use Oral B toothbrush so that included toothbrush is useless. The vibration is a joke.</li>
            <li> This unit has very limited power and water capacity. It does not provide anything like the cleaning capacity of the the plug in powered machine.</li>
            <li> ok but kind of awkward to use</li>
            <li> When my daughter got braces she had problems keeping them clean. This fixed that issue and she has fun using it.</li>
            <li> It was a great disappointment when the product failed to charge up after I used it for less than two weeks. The hassle of returning and paying for shipment made it a bad buying experience. I should have read more of the online reviews with many complaints about the charger failing to work.</li>
            <li> used it for about 4 weeks and it lost pressure.  i thought the units needs charging, so i charged it over night and it&#x27;s still the same.  i ordered two units, the 2nd unit is still going.  I just missed the 30 days return period. i&#x27;m not happy.  don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Great power for a cordless waterpik!</li>
            <li> Powerful and battery lasts a long time.  Just make sure to store it empty with the cap off so mold doesn&#x27;t grow.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem yet!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  So does my dentist.  At my last cleaning they joked that I might put them out of business.</li>
            <li> I used to have a traditional waterpik but do not have the counter space for the tub style waterpiks, anymore. This one is portable but it&#x27;s awkward to use because you have to keep it up right for the water to feed properly. This means that the waste water tends to run down over the unit, or my arm, or ...&lt;br /&gt;Love the toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Hard to learn to use. Can be very messy.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am a WaterPik &amp;#34;life member,&amp;#34; having used the counter models for decades.  OTOH, I&#x27;ve owned and been dissatisfied with the old portable model and spotted this one as I was ordering something else on Amazon.  The description read like they had finally gotten a useful portable, and since we&#x27;re headed for Spain in a few days, I decided to buy.  Alas, I was all the way to checkout when I decided to make sure that the charger was useable in Europe.  A bit of OCD, I thought, as everyone is using switching power supplies now that can handle 110 or 220.  Not so.  This is just for US and Canada.  Beware.  An odd failure, given that the portable one seems ideal for travel.  (I added the three star rating only because I had to rate in order to post - I am assuming it works wonders in places where it works, which doesn&#x27;t include the places I normally travel to.)</li>
            <li> My gums are much better. Water irrigation is so important for oral care . As one gets older, it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one that I had for about 4 years. This water flosser is a little larger; the on-off button took some getting used to.  The water reservoir is larger, but the directions said to empty it between uses (don&#x27;t let stale water sit in the flosser).  BUT it is not easy to completely empty it.  This is a little annoying.  I like that it has 4 tips and the directions tell you the use of each one.  And I was very surprised to receive an electric toothbrush as part of the package.</li>
            <li> This is a product in desperate, desperate need of a major overhaul.  The fundamental flaw with the product is that the charging receptacle is down at the bottom where it gets soaked with water, all the way back into the recesses of the receptacle.  Needless to say, trying to plug it in to charge it has very bad consequences if you don&#x27;t get all of the water out of that hole, which is hard to do.  My first one (the Plus model) basically fried the battery with green foam pouring out of the charging slot.  The second one got so corroded it stopped charging.  The third one (the Professional model) I&#x27;ve had to treat with kid gloves, which has been very inconvenient and frustrating.  Of course, the time you remember that it needs to be recharged is right after you use it, and getting all of the water out of that hole is near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Waterpik doesn&#x27;t seem to have any interest in fixing the problem, as they done nothing but a minor redesign over the course of 6+ years.  I&#x27;ve informed them of the problem repeatedly, and even got them to replace that first one under warranty, but they&#x27;ve done nothing to fix this huge issue.  The changed the shape of the receptacle a little bit a couple of years ago, but that&#x27;s all they&#x27;ve done, and it didn&#x27;t help.  I don&#x27;t understand why they refuse to address this issue.  Better yet, it&#x27;s time for them to transition to inductive charging the way the Philips flossers have.</li>
            <li> To much power for my gums. I purchased a different one with settings choice.</li>
            <li> Does a thorough job of cleaning</li>
            <li> I never guessed it was this noisy.&lt;br /&gt;the water reservoir is a bit small i need to refill it twice to finish the flossing, otherwise works as expected</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve in using this device.  It can and will be messy when you first use it.  Even after using it for a week or so it is still somewhat messy.  It is effective in cleaning under permanent bridges and around crowns.  While the device claims to be the easy and more effective way to floss, I like to use it to supplement my string flossing.  I use the Waterpik in the AM and do regular flossing at night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first use the water flosser, the 45 second water capacity will not finish your whole mouth.  You will need to refill it.  After you use it for a while you will be able to do your whole mouth without a need to refill.  I have some hygiene concerns about multiple people using the device, even though each person can have his or her own personal tips.  I don&#x27;t think the device is suitable for children for a number of reasons, including this one.  The force of the water is another issue, especially on the higher setting.  That setting was  uncomfortable for me, and I now use only the low power flow.  The lower power might still cause you some discomfort in the beginning if your gums are sensitive. They warn you not to use this device if you have an open wound in your mouth or on your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions with the unit could be better.  Some of the pictures show the tip facing in opposite directions from each other, which is a little confusing.  The device claims to be portable, but there is no case and no storage space in the unit for the tips.  If you are going to take this on a trip you will need to carry the tips in a plastic bag or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this for people who are unwilling or unable to use regular floss.  In my opinion, string flossing is still necessary, although this machine is a good supplement.  The nano-sonic toothbrush included is a nice bonus, especially if you decide you like that kind of thing.  I will continue to use it, but will probably return to an old-fashioned, hand-operated brush after it wears out.</li>
            <li> This is my first oral irrigation system/waterpik. It is meant to be a lite version of the original Waterpik, which must be used with a cord. It comes with 4 different heads/tips, and you must charge it for 24 hours before use. The waterpik comes with 2 power settings (a high and low setting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a huge learning curve in the beginning. The moment you open the box, you are greeted with a STOP sign that says to call them before you consider returning the product to your retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I filled the water reservoir (which you can also fill with mouthwash for a better clean) and turn on the devise. Filling up the water reservoir all the way equals to about 45 seconds of &amp;#34;water pumping&amp;#34;. 45 seconds is not enough to go through your entire mouth. You can veryquickly go through your top set of teeth with 45 seconds but if you want a very thorough clean, expect 4-6 refills. Refilling requires turning off the machine completely. You also get an electronic toothbrush whose head must be changed every 3 months (sold separately). It pulses instead of rotating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions says to place in mouth right before turning it on, otherwise it will splash everywhere. You can&#x27;t turn it sideways; it has to be upright. The end result is that you can&#x27;t see in the mirror what you are doing; so you end up &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; the water hit your gums and you gauge with that as you go. It can be very messy at first, which is why I understand why the maker includes that &amp;#34;STOP and call us before returning&amp;#34; flyer inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no battery indicator, so you have to periodically charge since you can&#x27;t tell how much battery there is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed this to my boyfriend who has the cord Waterpik version and his general advice can be summed up to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Its a great addition for travel, but a cord version has a bigger reservoir, more power, so for a few bucks more, you get more bang for your buck.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up briefly trying his cord waterpik, and would have to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is great for travel (not too bulky, can be wrapped around your towel to prevent it from breaking) but if you primarily are just going to use it at home, get the Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser, which is 90 seconds instead of 45, 7 tips instead of 4, with 10 pressure settings instead of 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize: it is great for travel or for a beginner, but better models do exist.nded up briefly trying his cord waterpik, and would have to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is great for travel (not too bulky, can be wrapped around your towel to prevent it from breaking) but if you primarily are just going to use it at home, get the Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser, which is 90 seconds instead of 45, 7 tips instead of 4, with 10 pressure settings instead of 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize: it is great for travel or for a beginner, but better models do exist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Waterpik before. I do floss, but not always as much as I should. I was really surprised by how well this works. I followed the direction for charging, filling and use and it was perfect. Really cleaned my teeth and gums. It was very easy to use. I did lean over the sink a bit when using it and had no problems with extra water flying around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this Waterpik and will continue to use it everyday. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> Now that I know what 5 stars means I can only give this excellent product 4 stars because love is precious and in my opinion reserved for people and living things. This waterpik will make your teeth feel like you just came home from the dentist--clean and smooth. The water cavity is small and may need to be refilled to finish the job but if space is an issue like for us the size works well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Too strong messy and not eas y to regulate water pressure&lt;br /&gt;Found it to cumbersome to hold I hate it. I am not even returning it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the trouble</li>
            <li> Lasted for just 3 months and there was not enough water pressure. Great when it lasted - but very short life.</li>
            <li> My waterpik works great. My teeth and gums feel clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is the second Cordless Waterpik that I have. I also have the non professional version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question you must ask yourself is how much you are going to use a Waterpik, and how you are going to use it. These cordless models have about sixty percent of the power of the corded models. Battery life is ok nothing to brag about for sure. You will have to recharge after about five days I found with my unit. It doesnt hold much liquid so you get about 30 seconds of use before you have to refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this shines is for travel. Should have been named travel pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra vibrating toothbrush thing is pretty useless other than a noise making toothbrush. Its just a gimmick.</li>
            <li> While I like the concept of a water flosser, I was surprised of the mess I made while using this flosser. It may be me but the water does splash around a lot and my sink was pretty much lined with water after I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife who does not floss using string as she deems it too painful was in fact the first to use this cordless waterpik as she feels that it will be painless and commented that she splashed water over herself using it the first time. While she is determined to continue using this cordless waterpik even though it messes up the bathroom sink, I on the other hand think that the mess to clean up after myself after using it to be more of a hassle. Also due to the fact that it splashes over, my wife literally sticks the flosser into her mouth making it almost impossible for me to use it due to hygiene purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of water that this cordless water flosser can handle is also a disappointment as I have to refill it at least 4 times before I feel that my teeth is completely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would very much like to recommend this product due to the ease of flossing, but at the same time am mindful that it does comes with some slight hassle.</li>
            <li> First and foremost this Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser does the job. But it does not produce the same water pressure as many other models, especially the corded models.  There appear to be only 2 pressure settings, low and high.  And the unit is big despite having only a modest size water reservoir.  Because of the limited size of the water reservoir you get only 30-45 seconds of flossing per fill, but the reservoir is very easy to fill.  You must also hold the unit upright.  If you travel on business or pleasure this would probably be a great unit to have and take with you.  But it is for use in the USA only per the manufacturer.  The box comes with the charging adapter and several different tips.  This unit might also be good for those with small bathrooms.  If you need a unit for home use only and have space in your bathroom for it I would recommend a corded, tub style model.  But for travel or if you simply do not have room, I would recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> We really wanted to like this, but I&#x27;m afraid it just doesn&#x27;t work very well.  It&#x27;s very messy &amp; easy to spill.  When we filled it with cold water, it was a little painful on the gums.  Our bathroom water isn&#x27;t filtered, so warm tap water isn&#x27;t very tasty for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But worst of all, we just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it to floss properly.  Every time anyone used it, we used regular floss afterwards and got debris out.  It just didn&#x27;t seem like the water flosser was actually flossing...  Maybe we used it wrong somehow, but we read the instructions and they seemed clear.  But even the high pressure didn&#x27;t really seem to do a lot.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never actually heard about a &#x27;water flosser&#x27; before I came across the Waterpik Cordless.  I&#x27;ve always been an old fashioned floss guy.  And after using the Waterpik for about 2 weeks, I think I&#x27;m going to remain an old fashioned floss guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that the Waterpik doesn&#x27;t work; it works fairly well, I suppose, but it&#x27;s quite a bit burdensome to operate.  Between having to charge the Waterpik, fill it up before every use, and then try not to drown yourself while using it, I&#x27;m just not convinced its something I need in my personal hygiene arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, I&#x27;m quite a big fan of the Nano Sonic Toothbrush that comes with the Waterpik.  It has become my primary toothbrush and even when the head is old, I&#x27;ll probably replace it with another.  I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So again, the Waterpik isn&#x27;t bad, but for me its just a bit much.  The water flossing does work, though I feel I have more control with my old fashioned floss.  Couple that with the space it takes up and the &#x27;maintenance&#x27; required in it, I&#x27;ll just stick to old fashioned floss.</li>
            <li> This cordless version of the waterpik is certainly not as powerful as the corded versions, like the Waterpik Ultra like I also have, but it is very convenient and does the trick for most cases.  The batteries last for many uses on a charge, so I&#x27;m happy with it.  The battery toothbrush that comes with it didn&#x27;t seem to be very useful at all, but it came with the waterpik, so why not.</li>
            <li> Well this works OK, I got this item twice for space saving and travel, a little awkward to use and the tank runs out of water quickly.  The big problem with this unit is that the rechargeable battery wears out very quickly and the switch drains the battery when it is off.&lt;br /&gt;This has happened on both of the units I used.  Didn&#x27;t buy it again.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good size fluid tank. Works better than expected. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT, It replaced an older model i have had for years but finally quit working, this model is even better!</li>
            <li> I used a regular Waterpik &#x27;Water Flosser&#x27; for years until it died a while ago. I figured I&#x27;d give a cordless a shot, however it&#x27;s no where near as convenient. I&#x27;m use to a simple 4&amp;#34; &#x27;wand&#x27; that you can maneuver however you please. This unit is large and not very maneuverable. What makes it worse is the fact that you can&#x27;t turn it on it&#x27;s side or upside down because the water flow will stop. As a result, it&#x27;s difficult to use this nearly as effectively as a standard corded model, and without making a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included sonic toothbrush is fantastic... cleans better then any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, and is easily the best part of this package. I would never want to go back to a regular toothbrush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety of tips are nice and with some patience you can get a good cleaning, however unless you have a reason for needing a cordless unit, I would strongly recommend sticking with a standard, corded unit.</li>
            <li> WAY better than the former portable model,  Bigger capacity, easier to fill and the charge lasts longer.  It is a little heavier tho.</li>
            <li> The hard to reach spaces between the reservoir and the body will develop mildew over time if not kept dry.  When it does it will take a thin cleaning object (I used a toothpick) to scrape the mildew off.  Not designed well for cleaning in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This portable cordless irrigator is so handy to use and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on my bathroom countertop.  When displayed on the countertop, it&#x27;s a reminder to use.  Plug it in when not in use; unplug it for each use.</li>
            <li> Have only used it twice since I got it. works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love the portability of it and it seems to do a better job than just flossing.  The Nano Sonic toothbrush is great as it takes less energy to brush the teeth.</li>
            <li> I am so happy  I purchased this!!  The dentist could not get me to use dental floss...so he suggested this which he highly recommended...&lt;br /&gt;I do it twice a day now!!  Can&#x27;t wait to see how my next dental cleaning goes....will update at that time.  But as far as use...it takes a little getting use to. The first few times the water flew all over!!!  But I&#x27;ve gotten it down to a science now...I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this, but I&#x27;m disappointed!    Before using:  Plug in for a day.. The small plug fits in at the side at the bottom of the waterpik    Open the plug on the handle to fill the container with water, which you have to do every time you use this. A mess as there is water all over , trying to aim for the water hole, even though your doing it in the bathroom sink.  (When finished, empty the water out by Shaking it !)  Select your tips, and there are a few, but I think there worthless.I did not feel anything using this.  Below where you put the tip in, is the tip Rotator, turn that to get the tip in..fits in easy. Also a tip ejector when finished using.  There is a power switch, and pressure control. We could not feel any difference!.    This waterpik is A bit awkward.    It also comes with a separate sonic type of a tooth brush (comes with battery ), that does Nothing!  Might be good for braces!    I would have liked this to come with the Tongue cleaner, and maybe the toothbrush tip!  If someone has braces, the toothbrush tip would probably work well..    I do use an electric tooth brush that I love.   Personally I did not find that any of the tips that came with this did anything different!  Maybe I expect more of something!!    When starting to use this,  Put the tips in your mouth first, then close your lips around it,  then turn it on,  It was still a dripping mess..My Husband had the same problem.  I also expected the water to come out stronger then what it did.! We felt nothing from the waterpik!     This is a big hassle to use.  There is not any place on this, or anything to keep your tips that fit on the waterpik after you use them!  Anyone have a suggestion where to put them , as they should dry..</li>
            <li> A wonderful addition for good oral hygiene.  Easy to operate and maintain.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the switch is badly designed as not to shut off when released. This makes it messy and difficult to control rather than push to use and release for shut off. It&#x27;s being poorly position easy to accidently bump the switch since it stays on you end up spraying fluid all over your bathroom mirror. The body is very bulky and clumbsy to use because of it&#x27;s size and shape. Another thing I noticed before this thing failed to last more than 6 months was how badly underpowered it was. When I was getting too close to my gums the thing would stall out completely. Bad switch, bad shape, no service life. With any stretch of the imagination I couldn&#x27;t expect a more poorly designed dental appliance to be sold on the open market. The engineers that came up with this design should go back to school and learn how to properly engineer and impliment a product correctly.</li>
            <li> Big improvement over previous models, this is the third one from Amazon, but it is twice the price. It does come with a sonic tooth brush for that price increase. In my opinion you wouldn&#x27;t miss the toothbrush if it wasn&#x27;t included.</li>
            <li> I use it to floss frequently since I just got braces.  It does the job, although I wish it had a little more power.  I saw some reviews where people said they had to use it on low or it hurt their gums, but I don&#x27;t understand that.  I use it on high and wish it had even more force.  It&#x27;s probably strong enough for most people though.</li>
            <li> Will work just for travel use---not an everyday item.</li>
            <li> drips water while using, very clumsy to use.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t hold much water. But still alright to use</li>
            <li> It is ok, but you have to keep filling up water.</li>
            <li> Has the power, maybe too much. I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I like these so much I have purchased 3 over the last 4 years.  I only have 1 issue with the waterpiks and that is they required charging too often.  But they work great and can certainly improve your dental check-ups.</li>
            <li> no power, no cleaning. don&#x27;t bother buying it does not have enough power to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; your teeth.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of a water flosser before, and since I hate flossing as well as the lectures about the need to floss whenever I see the dentist, I decided to give this one a try. After I charged the battery, I decided to give it a test spin and ended up getting water all over the bathroom and all over me. Hmmm. Read the instructions, dummy! After a few attempts, I was usually able to do a good job with this AND remembered to turn it off before taking it out of my mouth! I haven&#x27;t yet mastered how to consistently keep the water from running down my arm, but I&#x27;m getting there. I&#x27;m very anxious to see if I have a better report when I get my teeth cleaned at the dentist next month and will report back. I should mention that using cold water in the flosser can hurt - warm water is MUCH more comfortable! The toothbrush that&#x27;s included doesn&#x27;t impress me, but would be a handy travel toothbrush because of its size. I like my electronic toothbrush much better. Anyway, prior to getting this water flosser, I was only flossing a few times a week. With the water flosser, I&#x27;m using it a couple of times a day, so there has to be an improvement in the plaque build-up. Overall, I like this a lot - it&#x27;s just kind of messy to use.</li>
            <li> I thought the floss was different than what it actually was. but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> What a product just wow</li>
            <li> I love love love the Cordless Waterpik. It works wonders! I have braces and it&#x27;s the best way to floss. I highly recommend this awesome product, especially if you have braces.</li>
            <li> I just used it for one time then the battery started to run out so fast ( for like 10 sec ) and it stops working !! it is a complete waste of money .. I don&#x27;t know what to do about ! I was so excited to get it because of my braces, I was impressed the first time I used it and I felt my teeth were so clean &amp; fresh in much shorter amount of time comparing to regular flossing .. Too bad it didn&#x27;t even last for a another use .. DISAPPOINTED !!!</li>
            <li> Like the product, does a good job.  The one thing I have to say though is the reservoir is difficult to completely fill with the opening at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this because I hate to floss the regular way, even though I know everyone should do it.  However I just don&#x27;t see how this can really get the stuff out of between your teeth.  The water pressure just doesn&#x27;t seem that strong -- it seems like if I put water or mouthwash in my mouth and swish it around, forcing it through the spaces in my teeth, that it would be just as good or better.  I don&#x27;t have any visual clues of any gunk, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I&#x27;ll continue to use it because (1) it makes my mouth seem a bit fresher and (2) I&#x27;m going to trust that it&#x27;s working and maybe I just can&#x27;t see the gunk because it&#x27;s too small.  The included booklet talks about other attachments (like a tongue-cleaner) that didn&#x27;t come with my unit, but I can&#x27;t find them in my local Walmart.  I wonder if I&#x27;d have to order them from Waterpik directly?</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!!  Okay, I admit -- I don&#x27;t floss as often as I should.  I hate using the string, and when I try to use the little pick things they always break.  Several people have recommended the water flosser but I never got around to trying it.  I was thrilled to have an opportunity to try the product through Amazon Vine.  I&#x27;m guessing that at some point the novelty will wear off but for now, I&#x27;m loving my water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  It&#x27;s really fun to use.  You can direct the water stream right at the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;You can fill the reservoir with mouthwash!  Very exciting -- although, perhaps, a bit wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Unless you want to make a huge mess, you need to keep your mouth closed around the tip.  It makes it difficult to see what you&#x27;re doing on back teeth.  You can use it with your mouth open, of course, but be prepared to make a little mess.&lt;br /&gt;And it takes up a fair amount of premium bathroom-counter real estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my 6 month dental checkup in a few weeks so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what the dentist has to say --</li>
            <li> I have been a supporter of Waterpiks for many years.  They have kept my gums healthy and my teeth clean.  It battles the every-growing crop of plaque.  When one dies, I bid it a tender farewell and purchase another.  But they take up a lot of counter space.  You end up juggling cords.  Sometimes the whole thing tips into the sink and send a tsunami of mouthwash-flavored water on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by this model.  Cordless always seems like a good idea. And it definitely has a smaller footprint.  It also has a smaller water reservoir and lower pressure.  I will happily use it as a travel Waterpik, when I always miss my big bulky buddy.  But it doesn&#x27;t give me a thorough enough, or strong enough, water flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonic toothbrush, however, was a VERY nice surprise.  I don&#x27;t use an electric toothbrush because all my sink space is occupied by my beloved Waterpik.  But this thing is the size of a regular toothbrush.  In fact, I stored it with the regular toothbrushes and, last night, put toothpaste on  what was apparently its mechanical twin, and spent quite a bit of time trying to push the control button on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs on a AAA battery and seems to last a reasonable length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t scrub your enamel away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it leave my teeth squeaky shiny clean, the way they feel when you first leave the dentist after a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be traveling with me, too.</li>
            <li> Less drill and fill.  This helps the on the go person to keep a cleaner mouth and less hassle.</li>
            <li> This Sonic Flosser is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.  (The first time, I squirted water all over the mirror, though!)  It comes with several different heads for flossing, removing plaque, use with braces or crowns... It&#x27;s rechargeable, which is a must for me, so I don&#x27;t go through so many batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of this are that it&#x27;s not too big, it&#x27;s portable, and there&#x27;s no cord.  A drawback is, you have to hold it upright for the water to come out properly, so it&#x27;s dripping back out your mouth and down your hand and the flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this is works ok, but I have a really great Sonicare toothbrush that removes plaque and leaves my teeth feeling oh so clean.  Plus it&#x27;s easier to use than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flosser comes with a toothbrush which works ok, but just vibrates.  It&#x27;s nothing like my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works great! This is a super product. Easy to use and cleans very well. It comes with an adjustment for water delivery when using so it doesn&#x27;t produce too harsh or too little of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the water reservoir is a little small. Try the following with a larger tank&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I6GQVTE/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00I6GQVTE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;hocivfd-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;L4RWJWKJJYWH5W62&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it comes with a cord</li>
            <li> Small water reservoir, I need to fill it at least twice during my cleaning. It takes a bit of practice to get to the point where you don&#x27;t spray all over the mirror, but even then it&#x27;s pretty messy.  I haven&#x27;t found a way to clean all of my teeth where I don&#x27;t at some point have my drool running all over the unit. Holds charge okay and has nice water pressure to clean in between the teeth. Would be great for travel and of course doesn&#x27;t replace the tooth brush. Doesn&#x27;t take up much room. Needs a 24 hour charge before using and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have a charge level indicator. But it does a good job in spite of the drawbacks.</li>
            <li> How not to use a waterpik:&lt;br /&gt;Do not take it out of your mouth while itâ€™s on.&lt;br /&gt;Effects of waterpik:&lt;br /&gt;clean teeth&lt;br /&gt;wet hands&lt;br /&gt;occasionally bleedy gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the toothbrush that comes with it is actually really good. buzz buzz</li>
            <li> Works good but extremely noisy.</li>
            <li> Works just like the big one.</li>
            <li> This has a great design. It is easy to hold, it is easy to operate. Even though there is a place to fill a tank with water, I found it to sit comfortably in my hand. The water tank is not so big though that it makes the whole thing heavy. It holds about 45 seconds worth of water.  It really is comfortable and easy to hold and operate in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also came with several tips. My family liked that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My youngest son has enjoyed using this and in fact uses this longer than he would with his normal toothbrush and flossing. So I really appreciate that my youngest son enjoys this waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I would warn any purchaser is that you really have to be careful how you hold that machine. If you tip it too far to the side, it will not be able to shoot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real questions you have to decide is this: How important is it that you have a cordless waterpik? IF cords are important, you might consider the counter top model. If you want to take one to travel with, or you have a kid with braces that needs to floss often, this might be a good one to try. The other question you need to ask yourself is do you want more than 45 seconds of time to waterpik or can you use it and not tip it sideways?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is nice product, but there is not enough water pressure when using the PIK attachments.  I bought two, one for my granddaughter with braces who likes it, but agrees that it does not have enough pressure.  I fill the tank twice to use two times in order to get a more thorough flossing.  The upside is - the overall product seems well made and easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  I wish I would not have waited to &amp;#34;get around to&amp;#34; returning this item.  In waited too long to be able to return an item that was not useful at all.  I thought my dentist would be happy I bought something that seemed so neat!  He wished I would have asked him before I bought it!  It doesn&#x27;t work as it is described, and I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> A fairly compact, easy to set-up and use, water flosser that includes a small battery powered toothbrush that I&#x27;ve come to love.    This is my first first Waterpik.  I plaque like crazy, especially behind the lower front incisors.  My dentist recommends pro cleaning every 3 months, but the insurance won&#x27;t pay for it.  I brush twice daily (at least), floss frequently, use an anti-plaque rinse, and a nightly flouride swish and spit.  I found, after a little practice, this cordless unit a great asset to my regimen.    I read the simple instructions, and got going right away.  One learns quickly to keep the thing in your mouth or it becomes an formidable squirtgun.  It doesn&#x27;t feel good hitting your eyes or even the back of your throat.  It&#x27;s made out of plastic so don&#x27;t drop it.  They include 4 picks and the removable brush for the mini-vibrating toothbrush(Note: it vibrates, no rotating).    First, the unit needs to charge for 24 hours with the small plug-in ac box and narrow cord.  Then, chose your pick and insert; open the little side portal and fill with lukewarm water, close- keeping machine upright, stick in mouth, turn on and work along gumline.  There are 2 speeds, start with lower speed; it&#x27;s forceful and gums can be sensitive,    I like the feel of a good washing.  It cleans for about 40 seconds before the water runs out.  It also says one can add mouthwash to the apparatus.  I think it does a good job.  I still floss, but this machine  has helped to push out debris and cut back on my plaque significantly, and as you can tell, I&#x27;m obsessive about good dental hygiene.    I love to travel and travel light.  I have used tiny, vibrating travel brushes like the cute one included.  I like the size and the idea, but they don&#x27;t clean so well.  I ended up buying a smaller full sized electric toothbrush- that&#x27;s powerful and the bristles actually rotate that I take in my carry on(which is all the luggage I take when travelling).  Would I take the Waterpik along.  Hmm, Idon&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m tempted.  It is doable.    Reading the reviews, some people don&#x27;t like this unit or, perhaps, are unsure of Waterpiks in general.  With experimenting, bending over the sink in different head tilts, I&#x27;ve become quite good at hiiting back and front gumlines.  Initially, I was concerned about getting the backside of those lower front incisors but I&#x27;ve become quite proficient at it and can now do a decent cleaning with one water fill.    Overall, it&#x27;s a big thumbs up for me, and I enjoy using it.  We&#x27;ll see how long the machine last, and, perhaps, I&#x27;ll try it on the next trip.</li>
            <li> The description of this product says it has an &#x27;ergonomic&#x27; design and that it is ideal for use in small bathrooms or for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a WaterPic or other flosser before, so I didn&#x27;t quite know what to expect. Somehow, it wasn&#x27;t this WaterPic flosser. The design seems strange. It really resembles a cell phone from the 80s, the type you see a character pull out in a period film and you laugh because it looks so big and bulky compared to what we have know. This flosser is the same; big and bulky. Because it is fairly big, it seems a little unwieldy and strange. I also don&#x27;t agree it is ideal for small bathrooms and travel. It is larger than our two electric toothbrushes combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is very easy to fill the reservoir. I also add a little mouth wash to the reservoir. It seems to do a good job. I have tried both pressure settings and the harder pressure seems to do a better job and it feels more like getting your teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two regular pics, a plaque tip and an orthodontics tip. They are fairly easy to insert, but a little difficult to get out. we actually broke one of the tips, because it was inadvertently knocked off the bathroom sink, and I had to use scissors to pull the broken base out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t come with a base, but the unit has a flat bottom. When you recharge it, there is really no where for the extra cord to go. I wrapped it around the unit a few times, to keep it out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been using it for about 10 days and have only recharged it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a sort of mini battery-operated sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think it works well, the design could definitely be improved.</li>
            <li> This waterpik seems to be a newer version of a waterpik I already own, which is the [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS]]&lt;br /&gt;It looks identical, although it has a different color scheme and power plug.  The Cordless Plus is currently used by one of my daughters who finds it to work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a tub style waterpik [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] which is getting kind of old and so I decided to get this water flosser as they call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that it doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the capacity that the tub style has, but I don&#x27;t understand why people would compare apples to oranges like that.  If it had a bigger reservoir it would weigh more (water is heavy) and then it would be bulky to use.  It is also true that it doesn&#x27;t have the power of a plug in version.  Would you buy a Smart car and later complain that it did not seat 8?  Or complain that it could not tow a trailer?  Clearly that would be silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this version is very handy for travel, for people who are in the habit of using a water pik regularly.  It doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this waterflosser does a great job for what its intended to be: a smaller, more portable version of a great device.  With portability comes natural tradeoffs.</li>
            <li> It is definitely helpful for someone with braces!</li>
            <li> Good for travel - the adapter says 120v only though. In this day and age where chargers are universal, I was a bit surprised.&lt;br /&gt;I charged in the razor outlet in a bathroom in Singapore and the adapter started buzzing.</li>
            <li> If you are traveling and really want to have a water flossing machine with you, this is certainly smaller than a counter-top machine, and seems to work about as well (standard attachments for the newest models of full size Waterpic flossers fit it).  HOWEVER ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bulky to hold and still do a good job of flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take multiple refills of the reservoir per use to do a decent job of flossing.  The full size counter-top model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very difficult to get to the back side of the lower teeth unless you&#x27;ve just refilled it, because as the reservoir empties with the unit tilted toward 90Â° it stops feeding water through the system when the water level gets low.  Here is where the full size counter-top model excels - you only have to hold the pik attachment itself on its long, flexible tubing, and you can get it to any angle with virtually no weight or bulk in your hand (unlike this cordless model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic latch on the bottom that holds the reservoir in place gives the impression that it will break after not-too-many uses.  While I can&#x27;t be sure of that, it certainly has that appearance.  And if it breaks, the reservoir won&#x27;t remain in place on the unit, rendering it useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no charging light, indicating either that it needs charging, or that charging is complete (or if there is one, it is considerably well hidden!  LOL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the included toothbrush is almost useless.  I fully understand that sonic toothbrushes are designed for minimal pressure on teeth (not hard brushing back and forth like an inexpensive traditional manual toothbrush).  But while using it, the user&#x27;s mouth needs to stay closed so that tiny droplets of toothpaste-filled water aren&#x27;t scattered all over your sink and mirror area.  Yet just that much &amp;#34;restriction&amp;#34; from the user&#x27;s lips on the movement of the brush is enough to stop the brush entirely, or slow it down to where its action is relativelyuseless.  If you want the Waterpik flosser, fine.  But don&#x27;t expect anything from the included toothbrush.  We&#x27;ve got Sonicare toothbrushes,&lt;br /&gt;and this is simply not even remotely in the same class.  I would not trust my tooth and gum health to the toothbrush itself.  The flosser is fairly decent, with the limitations listed above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay the current price for it (around $45 on Amazon) unless I had a significant need for this type of device and would be traveling for an extended period of time (more than just a few days).  Instead, I&#x27;d just rely on regular floss for a few days on a trip, then do a good thorough job at home with our counter-top model (which we love).</li>
            <li> LOVE this water flosser!  Because I like to make sure I get all of the junk out, I fill it up twice, but that is just my personal preference.  I have the full sized one in my bathroom; this stays in my suitcase for travel.  I really like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to keep it charged up every day!  That is a true bonus for me!  I charge it about once a month.</li>
            <li> I just used four times but broken!!!!!Can not be charged any longer!!!</li>
            <li> Charging battery now to try out me new gadget.</li>
            <li> Just recently switched to a waterpik and I love it.  I truly believe it&#x27;s better than flossing, but i think it boils down to how skilled you are at it (I Sucked).  I opted for the wireless route due to the fact that i wanted to take up the minimalist amount of space in the bathroom.  I would highly recommend the wired versions if you have the space.  The water in the reservoir in the wireless runs out fast and you need to refill frequently.  The wired versions hold double the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter which option you choose, you wont be disappointed with the results</li>
            <li> Needed a smaller waterpik for sink counter space. The higher speed does very well in removing debris. Like that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Product is heavy, not balanced properly and a challenge to navigate thru the mouth. The &#x27;well&#x27; never dries out correctly so mold starts to grow...Toilet Tree has a better oral irrigator!</li>
            <li> Works very well on my teeth to get them nice and clean, works very well I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is definitely nice product for traveling or for urgent flossing during the day in the office. This however does not have enough power and large enough reservoir for good dental hygiene. So if you know the application, it is impressive compact device.  The toothbrush is also great bonus and works well.</li>
            <li> I mix it with about 5:1 water to mouthwash. It goes through it really fast. The first couple of uses I didn&#x27;t get but about 1/2 way done when it ran out. I do it in the shower since it is cordless. Instead of getting out to refill half way through, I just learned to get through my entire mouth much quicker. So not sure how effective it is doing that. The toothbrush that comes with it works well, although I think it will need a replacement battery soon, after about 10 uses.</li>
            <li> flow is a little weak.</li>
            <li> Works great and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> Everyone needs this product, it&#x27;s grest</li>
            <li> Water tank leaked from bottom.  Returned.</li>
            <li> I am sort of addicted to it. I have used it daily since I got it. My teeth feel tighter, not wiggly. Also, it seems to hold a charge for a while, I want to say it lasted a month before it first need to recharge. I was reluctant of it making a mess at first. Most of the time I use it in the shower. It was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the counter space so I bought the portable Water Pik.&lt;br /&gt;I find the portable easier to maneuver above the sink because there are no cords. The water does empty quickly because the reservoir is smaller than the full size (fill it up 4 or 5 tines for each flossing.but I don&#x27;t mind, I love using this). It&#x27;s very easy to clean and I&#x27;ve had  no mold issues.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for 6 months. My dental hygienist said my gums are gorgeous. Gorgeous gums. They&#x27;re as nice as my teeth now! I&#x27;m buying all my family members a water pik water flosser. Cleaning under the gum line is crucial, &amp; this is is great too especially  you have crowns or a bridge. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Very weak stream.</li>
            <li> Ok it pulses water fast.It is not asked to do much more.In that way it delivers.In the way of convenience (its a task when your parneter wishes to use it and needs to change heads when everyone is in a rush to get ready. Water needs constant refill and spills out alot when filling.COuld be better,could be worse</li>
            <li> Works well.  Is a little hard on your gums.  What I dont like is that the water runs out very quickly!</li>
            <li> A bit messy, but guess they all are.  I use it only when traveling and it does the job fine.  Usually require two refills per use.</li>
            <li> it should be better if the water flow could be controlled by pressure. The water dispenser is also difficult to clean, really difficult. This is my second one, the first could not be charged twice. Then I thought about bad lucky, but the second one has not good pressure at all.</li>
            <li> This travel set is not nearly as good as the regular large waterpik and a regular sonic brush.  They lack umph.  But are better than nothing when traveling.</li>
            <li> This is a cool gadget that provides blasts of water to floss on a semi-professional level. It&#x27;s more &#x27;fun&#x27; than string flossing and more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both praise and boos for the device which has lead me to give it a so-so average rating. Here&#x27;s my rundown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- More effective than flossing&lt;br /&gt;- Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Small water reservoir requires multiple refills for one flossing&lt;br /&gt;- Messy&lt;br /&gt;- More work than string flossing&lt;br /&gt;- Requires some counter space (certainly more than a pack of string floss)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: I admit that I&#x27;ve never been a very religious flosser so I was really hoping this device could make the routine more exciting and convenient. It is &#x27;easier&#x27; than flossing in that you don&#x27;t have to open your mouth all weird and angle string funny, but it&#x27;s also more work between the water refills and cleaning up the watery mess afterwards. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think this will inspire me to floss any more regularly, but I do like the clean feeling I have after a quick session so maybe it will.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the waterpik, I have braces and using this is the only way to keep them clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Great for Travel, if you can afford the larger Waterpik with the large tank, I suggest that for Daily use and this for travel!</li>
            <li> I found this messy to use -- if you don&#x27;t hold the device at the correct angle, water goes everywhere and when you do hold it at the correct angle, you&#x27;re likely to have water running down your arm. I&#x27;m not sure of its effectiveness either. I didn&#x27;t feel like the amount of water in the reservoir was enough to do a thorough cleaning of my teeth. While it&#x27;s certainly quite a bit smaller than a traditional water flosser with a tank, it&#x27;s not small enough to be portable. I also worried about how hygienic it was -- it wasn&#x27;t easy to drain the residual water or clean the interior of the device.  I really wanted to like this but I ended up going back to regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included toothbrush is a nice travel toothbrush but it&#x27;s not up to par with a true powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This set works really well for cleaning around my son&#x27;s braces and he loves to use it! It can be a bit tricky to use since the flosser must be in your mouth before turning it on.</li>
            <li> Not as good as it was advertised. Does not look very durable. Not as powerful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Love it but does splash all over my sink</li>
            <li> As a Dental Hygienist, I recommend this to EVERYONE!  Every single person can benefit from this AND this price is way less than what I can order it directly from Waterpik!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first water flosser, so I have nothing to compare it to. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because nothing is ever perfect. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have a hard time feeling the difference between the different attachments. The bonus toothbrush was a nice addition. Be warned though, it can be very messy the first few times until you get used to it. I would recommend try it first in the shower. I was going to let my younger kids use it, until I made a huge mess the first time; I think I&#x27;ll wait until they are older. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had deep pockets around my back teeth, and I am sure I would loose some if I had not had this recommended to me by my dentist.  Compared to the Waterpik, floss is ineffective, hard to use, time consuming and requires too much self-discipline for me!  I bought the newer handheld version and found that one charge lasts for many, many uses.  Even though the reservoir holds enough for only one use, it is quick and easy to refill.  I keep mine in the shower and find it easy to use daily. And I like the little vibrating toothbrush that comes free in the kit better than my clunky old Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted. Does a great job...</li>
            <li> stopped charging after a 2 motnhs</li>
            <li> Love the free electric brush and the Waterpik quickly became a daily habit.  Worth every penny - cordless is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Lost its &amp;#34;Travel Capability&amp;#34; trophy! apparently the provided charger is limited to 120 V (how weak that could be?!!) it is suppose to be ranged between 110 V to 240 V. In addition the charger cables plugs into the front of the device!!! which will cause non user/operation friendly (wires on the way while charging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs re-design</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dentist.  I have fillings that make flossing at the back of my mouth difficult.  I tested it in many ways and by golly, even after flossing I saw some fine particles of food following use of the pick.  Easy to use once you learn to keep your head in the sink so you do not splay water around.  Now I recommend!</li>
            <li> I would like to get the one with cord next time. this unit has strange reaction after charge, sometime the water force is strong but sometime is weak like got half charge.</li>
            <li> One of the tubes included came with the whole damage.</li>
            <li> I have to fill it up twice in order to cover my entire gum line. The pressure isn&#x27;t sufficient to feel like it&#x27;s doing much good. The vibrating toothbrush seems like a novelty more than actually effective.</li>
            <li> great tool, for the money.</li>
            <li> Seems to be effective at removing food particles.  It has to be refilled with water half way through, which is inconvenient but better than a tank on the vanity.</li>
            <li> We even could not recharg it  after the initial charge.  We will have to return it after our trip.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and effective.</li>
            <li> Best water flosser for the price range on the market</li>
            <li> Works as expected, minimal directions included but sufficient, so far so good.  The toothbrush is really nice too.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing that I found. It is awesome it&#x27;s really great especially for those people that have braces. I used to floss in about 15 minutes because of the threading with floss due to having braces but now I floss in less than three minutes. Best thing ever!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Like the flosser and the sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> Very good products, good price</li>
            <li> Great for your teeth and gums!</li>
            <li> Good to keep healthy gums</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my husband for Christmas.  Just right size for bathroom counter works great he loves it.  Small and just right for a personal waterpik</li>
            <li> I do ot like to floss but do out of necessity and this makes it much easier, just a messy exercise, recommend for your gum and teeth  health</li>
            <li> I have no complaints! This thing works great, and my teeth and gums have never been healthier! It does burn through the water it holds pretty quickly, but I don&#x27;t know what else one would expect, it&#x27;s a compact form so it can only hold so much water. I&#x27;ve never felt the urge to fill it more than twice for a good flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: A coworker bought the non-professional version of this, and as far as I can tell there is no functional difference.</li>
            <li> The cordless flosser is awesome in terms of functionality. But its construction makes it very difficult to clean. There should be a drain on the tank, etc.</li>
            <li> From my wife Sarah: I&#x27;ve been using this Waterpick Cordless Water Flosser for years, and am very pleased with it. This new version also includes the Nano Sonic Toothbrush which I&#x27;m also pleased with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve completely reversed the gum pockets, infection and inflammation using the Waterpick and adding some antibacterials to the water. With only using water, it didn&#x27;t reverse, but when I added the antibacterials it did. I&#x27;ll give you my tips for use below, but first, here are the pros and cons on this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s extremely easy to use. It takes seconds to figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The water gets under and on the gums and between teeth, easily cleaning between teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I find it easier than dental flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s rechargeable, and you don&#x27;t have to have a cord in the unit when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s lightweight, and I believe this new one is just slightly lighter than the older one I was using. It&#x27;s comfortable in your hand, and allows for a natural grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You can use it with a more gentle stream if you&#x27;re sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The various tips do a good job at getting at the plaque and bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The new Nano Sonic toothbrush is portable (great for traveling), easy to use, and does a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that after a long while, the units have started leaking. So while I&#x27;m using the unit, I&#x27;d start to have water dripping on my from the bottom of the unit. This one I&#x27;m reviewing is new, and it hasn&#x27;t happened yet. I don&#x27;t know if it will, and I suspect in the past it may be because of one of the antibacterials I&#x27;ve added to the water that&#x27;s on the acidic side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time this happened I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement part, so this was good service on their part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve done to reverse gum problems using the Waterpik:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I add and rotate various antibacterial mouth washes (mostly of the health food store variety) in the water. By rotating my theory is that you can kill different types of bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the big gun and the antibacterial that completely reversed my gum problems is an antibacterial/antiviral/antifungal called MMS (This stands for Miracle Mineral Supplement). MMS is sodium chlorite activated with either citric acid or HCL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to my dental hygenist I was having some pockets, inflammation and gum bleeding, and after using the MMS, I had no pockets or any sign if problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MMS is a bit controversial but I find it utterly amazing and safer than most drugs. It&#x27;s inexpensive, available easily only on the web, and when used carefully it has been very safe and effective for us, with way less side effects than antibiotics and antivirals. I suspect much of the controversy about it is because it can&#x27;t be patented and it competes with many expensive drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it with success knocking out colds and viruses in hours, quickly reversing lung and sinus infections, reversing a severe infection that may have had MRSA from a bug bite without pharmaceutical antibiotics that had my entire thigh swollen and oozing and my doctors freaked out, and I was completely cured from rosacea (which has no cure according to mainstream doctors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 drops of activated MMS in my Waterpik water a few times a week completely reversed the gum issues, and I do a once a week application for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband had to have deep scaling almost every time he went for a teeth cleaning because of deep pockets. If he uses the MMS in his waterpik regularly, he doesn&#x27;t need the deep scaling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching in depth, for myself and my family I feel very comfortable using MMS, and find it amazing. It works great with the Waterpik. (Research by doing a google search of MMS and Jim Humble, and decide for yourself.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the bottomline:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Waterpik if you have gum issues or if you wish to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you have infection or pockets, we&#x27;ve found that adding antibacterials to the Waterpik has reversed our problems.line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Waterpik if you have gum issues or if you wish to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you have infection or pockets, we&#x27;ve found that adding antibacterials to the Waterpik has reversed our problems.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well. Would like more volume. Must hold upright.</li>
            <li> I like the concept but it leaked and wasn&#x27;t easy to use.  I returned it.  It would have been better if had a cord like the regular waterpik.</li>
            <li> Lasted five months only &amp; motor burnt out. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it  , not worth it.</li>
            <li> best for home use as does not use batteries. but we love it and have one in all our bathrooms. it is best water pik ever!! for traveling we use  the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A .</li>
            <li> there is no water pressure is it supposed to be that low I don&#x27;t think so it seems like it&#x27;s way too low</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is a good starter model for those who are new to water flossing or Waterpik. If you have sensitive teeth and/or gums, or if you have nicely arranged teeth without any crooked ones, this might work well. I have been using the Aquarius model (newest model) and that has been working well for my not so beautifully arranged teeth because the Aquarius model includes various pressure settings, which is what I really need. However, after trying this model several times, I was less thrilled with the battery powered water pressure. This model still works well for a quick and gentle water flossing, but this Waterpik is not nearly as superior as the Aquarius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product design is not too bad, but the unit is bigger than I expected. I still have no problem holding this Waterpik in one hand and doing water flossing, yet I have to admit that it feels slightly awkward compared to the other corded model. Also, there is no battery status indicator light. I charged the unit for 24 hours prior to the initial use as the user manual recommends, but after several times of usage, I had no idea how much battery remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Cordless. Although the unit itself is little bit bulky to hold in one hand (especially if you have small hands), it is still cordless and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four tips and a vibrating tooth brush are included. The tooth brush is nothing like one of those electric tooth brushes, but itâ€™s compact and nice to have one when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water flossing still works. There are only two pressure settings, but unless you always have to do high pressure, the two settings included in this unit works fine. Some tips require setting at the lowest pressure for satisfactory result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Water pressure. This is a battery powered model. Thereâ€™s a 2.4V NI-MH 1300mAh battery inside. The motor looked the same as the Aquarius&#x27;, but because this unit uses battery power, I guess the pressure this can produce is limited.I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s too hazardous to put Li-ION inside, but I really wish this device had more water pressure. The high setting on this unit produces about same pressure as 5 on the Aquarius. Lastly, when using the device, the unit always has to be used straight up when water flossing; one cannot tilt it or use it horizontally, which is can be quite inconvenient, depending on the user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small water reservoir. Because this model is cordless, it might have been difficult to put a large tank. As a result, a small tank requires frequent refills. I had to refill 2~3 times to complete one water flossing. However, this might be my own personal preference. I tend to take my time for a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is OK. While it works gently on the gums and between teeth, thereâ€™s a trade off. Recharging is required and refilling is also required even more frequently. This model is about half price for what I paid on the Aquarius model, yet Iâ€™d still recommend the Aquarius model (or the Ultra model) over this model. This Waterpik, in my opinion, is just too limited for what it can do. The bottom line is this: if you want a starter Waterpik, this model is a good one; if you need a Waterpik with more pressure settings and various tips for specific purposes--in my case, the pressure setting and tip for users with periodontal disease--I strongly recommend one to consider purchasing the Aquarius model; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This unit is almost identical to a Waterpik Cordless that I already own - as far as I can tell the only changes made on this model are a different plug for the A/C adapter and the color of the water tank (used to be blue, now clear).  I have never used the larger corded model Waterpik, but I can&#x27;t imagine using a Waterpik with a stronger jet than this one - as it is I typically leave the unit on its low setting and have no issues getting all of the gunk out of my teeth, and i have never considered this underpowered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint on this unit is the battery - I wish the included NiMH battery was a bit larger so that I would not be having to charge this constantly.  As is I usually only get a few uses out of a Waterpik before a recharge is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the included toothbrush, it is a tiny sonic-style toothbrush powered by a single AAA battery.  I will never use it as I can&#x27;t stand this style of toothbrush (I prefer rotating heads like on Oral-B products), and it is really too small for everyday home use.  But those who like this style of toothbrush may find handy for travel.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little awkward to have to hold it vertical but it&#x27;s easier to use than I thought it would be.  I bought this brand because my other Waterpik tips will fit on it.  I wanted to use my periodontal tip on it but the periodontal tip has a smaller opening and it seemed to make the motor work a lot harder so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  I don&#x27;t know why anybody would use this instead of the countertop model.  Only if you really want something cordless.  I bought it for camping and travelling and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  The water power is just right.  The water lasts 55 seconds on the lower setting and 45 seconds on the higher setting.  Other reviewers complain of how quickly it runs out of water but refilling it is so simple that I don&#x27;t see how there is any concern there.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend this to anyone.  The unit work fine. It is just very messy.  It has two pressure setting to which was OK. Wish it was stronger.  The thing I did not like is when using it, the water jet would splatter outside due to the pressure hitting the teeth.  You end up washing or wiping up all those water around the countertop.</li>
            <li> Even after flossing and brushing, the water pik still pick up something that left. Great item. Wish it was less messy for me.</li>
            <li> I know I should floss, I know how to floss, and when I&#x27;m done flossing I feel great, but the string method is uncomfortable and inconvenient.  If I flossed even once a week that would be meaningful to my dental health, and therefore my health overall.  Besides, I&#x27;m a television and film actor, so I really should do it because it makes me look good on camera--and to me that&#x27;s money in the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this new version of Waterpik&#x27;s affordable model, I am flossing regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREATLY IMPROVED--LARGER CAPACITY AND POWER: I had a different model of Waterpik before that I bought in my local drug store but ended up throwing it out.  The power ran down completely after only one use and it held slightly less fluid than was needed to make it through a single flossing--so it needed to be recharged after each use and filled twice for a single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is much better.  With the upgrade in the battery, I can do three or four flosses before I need to recharge, and with the slightly larger tank it holds plenty of fluid so I can floss thoroughly and do a second pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEEMS LIGHTER AND EASIER TO HOLD: Even with the slightly larger tank completely full, and though the overall design is about the same size, it seems lighter than the previous model.  This design is also more ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOOTHBRUSH: I had been using Oral B electronic toothbrushes with guilty conscience because when an Oral B&#x27;s brush head wears out it&#x27;s not replaceable so you have to throw the whole thing out.  But with the Waterpik Nano Sonic Toothbrush, not only is the head replaceable but it&#x27;s also a much better electronic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral B model is too powerful.  I would say it&#x27;s like sticking a Dremel tool in your mouth, but that would be an insult to the fine tools by Dremel with which you can do very detailed work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik Nano Sonic seems like a much more expensive electric toothbrush but at an affordable price.  Again, this is a good item to buy if you&#x27;re considering paying big money for a top of the line model, but not sure if you would use it yet.  The Waterpik will certainly sell you on the idea where the Oral B may not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: There are much smaller, lighter, and better water flossing wands out there, but they cost at least four times as much.  This is the best bang for your buck, especially if you&#x27;ve never used a liquid flosser before.  While I&#x27;m sure that I will one day get a deluxe model now that I&#x27;m on my second flosser, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this one particularly for the price and convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nano Sonic toothbrush as well is much better than the cheap Oral B models I had been using until now, and for a bonus, this one has a replaceable brush head, which means less plastic items in land fills and floating around in our oceans.this is a good item to buy if you&#x27;re considering paying big money for a top of the line model, but not sure if you would use it yet.

            <li> What I need, healthy teeth every day.</li>
            <li> it is came with out the Nano Sonic Tootbrush, I dont why</li>
            <li> Feels like after your teeth were cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Poor design. Splash water everywhere. Unusable. Better stick to the simple and easy floss.</li>
            <li> This replaced an old Waterpik flosser I had for several years.  This new one has a NIMH battery so it will not develop the memory effect the other one did with its NICAD battery.  The old one stopped holding a charge.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these flossers do a great job for me in keeping my teeth and gums in great shape.</li>
            <li> So happy I purchased this carry water Flosser for traveling it works just fine and take with me when I travel. Fully recommend this product for the road travel and if you want one at home you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier model,  but after a couple years of use the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge beyond two or three days; that is normal for rechargeable batteries of all types, of course.  This slightly updated version is just as powerful as the first one, holds just as much water, holds its charge for up to two weeks (so far), _and_ includes a battery-powered toothbrush as a bonus.  The toothbrush can&#x27;t compare with my Sonicare, but it&#x27;s nice to have on overnight trips.</li>
            <li> Just love using my new Waterpik. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cleans gums very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still pretty big, but it&#x27;s much nicer than the original because you can just fill it up with water, use it, and then toss it under the sink. My boyfriend travels with his. Not as many pressure settings as the original.</li>
            <li> Purchased this unit for home use and for travel. I think it will work for travel although it&#x27;s larger than I expected. Using it is quite awkward for me. For best results the unit has to be held upright which is doable when flossing, however when trying to run water through to clean it, it&#x27;s difficult to hold the unit upright and get the water in the sink versus spraying everywhere. Also, the opening to the water reservoir is very small and is positioned where you can&#x27;t just dump the water out but must tilt it back and forth to empty.</li>
            <li> It worked great... for 40 days. Now it doesn&#x27;t charge. I tried different outlets, no dice. Thanks, Waterpik!</li>
            <li> This waterpik comes with great attachments and is small enough to live on my bathroom sink. I keep it plugged in to avoid losing power mid rinse. It was inexpensive but of high quality. Only last for about 30 seconds before a refill.</li>
            <li> water tank is leaking at seam and cannot use after a week or so????</li>
            <li> Worked great for a couple months, great idea, however I&#x27;ve had trouble with battery life. Bought another one and same thing! Battery life.  Works great for awhile.  Not worth the hassle</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much power, but it seems to do the job. I do like it better than my old Water Pic with the separate water tank and water wand. It will likely be better for traveling. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but if I get 5 years out of it I&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have had a waterpik in the past that needed to be plugged into the wall and operated from a large water reservoir that sat on the counter. I liked that one but it was bulky and not so convenient. This in is basically the same thing but handheld and smaller, which is much better. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is not as nice as the electric toothbrush I already have so I really dont have a review of that. If you didn&#x27;t have an electric toothbrush already, this would be a good starter one, I guess.</li>
            <li> I am a flosser, and I don&#x27;t like it. Every evening I pull out my waxed floss and go to town on my pearly whites. This is not something I relish, but I need to save all my teeth. So, when I saw the Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser, I jumped at it. (Honestly, I could care less about the Nano Sonic Toothbrush that comes with it, but more on that later.) Following the instructions I charged it, filled up the water reservoir with luke warm water and started Niagara Falls in my mouth to the sink. You&#x27;re supposed to hold the Flosser at a 90 degree angle so that the water flosser head is at the correct angle with your gums, but if you do that, there&#x27;s no way that the torrent of water coming out of your mouth is not going to dribble all over the Water Flosser and your arm (I don&#x27;t care what the picture shows of the correct use of the Flosser; in the real world, your arm and the Water Flosser are going to be drenched.) Then, just when you&#x27;re getting used to the idea, it runs out of water and ends water flossing. Its water capacity is described as &amp;#34;45 seconds.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s right on the button. You get drenched for 45 seconds at a throw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was thinking 1 Star with the tag line borrowed from Hobbes &amp;#34;... solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.&amp;#34; However, I so detest the necessity of string flossing, that I kept testing up. Knowing well in advance that I was in for 45 second of arm-drenching, I concentrated on the most sensitive areas in the back of my mouth. First of all, it blasted out food particles; which is its primary job. Second, it felt sooooo good on my gums that I didn&#x27;t want it to quit. A gum massage compared to the assault by my string floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the charging, I had no problems. After an hour&#x27;s charge, I flipped the &amp;#34;intensity&amp;#34; switch to II (2) and blasted away for 45 seconds. I don&#x27;t know how many times I could have done that before the charge failed, but since I have to stop every 45 seconds to refill it with water, I have the patience for only a few refills. They suggest starting with the lower intensity I (1), but that didn&#x27;t seem to do very much at all. Don&#x27;t waste your time on I; go to II and while you don&#x27;t get the fire hose blast that some prefer, you get enough water jet speed to knock out hidden food particles between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the Nano Sonic Toothbrush that comes with the flosser: It&#x27;s small and handy; perfect for travel. Up until now, I&#x27;ve never taken my electric toothbrush with me on trips. I just leave it in the charger at home. The Nano Sonic Toothbrush runs on a single AAA battery and fits nicely in my shaving kit. My other electric toothbrush comes with a big travel carrier, but it&#x27;s too big and bulky. So up until now, I just use a standard hand powered toothbrush on trips. Now, however, I take along the Nano Sonic Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system comes with four flossing heads; two standard, one with bristles, and one with a fine stream attachment. There is a single detachable brush for the Nano Sonic Toothbrush.ill it with water, I have the patience for only a few refills.

            <li> I am a religious flosser, and so I wanted to see how good Waterpiks are. Plus, I am currently an Invisalign user. Consequently, I have different spacings moving around between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the good. the Waterpik does work. It will get all the food particles out of your teeth. The 7 oz. of water blasts out of the Pik in two settings (low and high). I only use high, not sure why anyone would use the low setting (maybe for sensitive areas?). Second, your teeth will not only literally have any food debris cleared, your teeth will actually feel polished after using the Waterpik. Third, the battery life is pretty amazing. I have gotten almost two full weeks of once-a-day use out of it from only one charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the other. The Waterpik is huge. While it may be \\&quot;ergonomic\\&quot; as the description says, the Waterpik is a beast. And that&#x27;s not bad, but it is worth noting. I almost feel goofy holding this monstrosity. That said, the 7 oz. reservoir still isn&#x27;t big enough to clean my whole mouth. I have to refill it during use to clean all my teeth. No big deal I suppose. Then there&#x27;s the noise this thing puts out: it sounds like the motor is dying, which is no big deal (as that&#x27;s just the sound it makes), but I found it an odd noise. Lastly, there isn&#x27;t a charge meter on it to let you know when the unit is ready to be unplugged; again, not a big deal, but it makes conserving energy and extending battery life easier when you have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you go. I like the Waterpik. Has solid pros and no real cons. That said, I won&#x27;t give up my Plackers and floss just yet 9 I usually Waterpik, then floss, then brush, then mouthwash), but I appreciate the element the Waterpik brings to my dental hygiene regiment. So weigh out the options and determine if it is good for you. People with braces will probably benefit most from it because flossing is practically a non-option, but everyone will be able to get good use from the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Stopped working in high setting after three months. No contact seller option. The low setting is useless.</li>
            <li> Great product and long charge.</li>
            <li> My dental cleanings have gone from good to excellent!!  This is my 2nd identical unit!!</li>
            <li> I splattered water and mouthwash all over my bathroom mirror and sink the first time I used this because I had no idea how to. When I finally got the hang of it, it works pretty well. I also like that it&#x27;s portable because I travel a lot and I get to bring it with me anywhere I go.</li>
            <li> A number of issues with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1) messy, water flow is difficult to handle with one hand&lt;br /&gt;2) water supply is too small for thorough cleaning&lt;br /&gt;3) doesn&#x27;t allow additives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes: compact</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one of these&lt;br /&gt;Oral health made easier</li>
            <li> Messy with poor performance,  I would not buy again.  I made a mistake buying cordless.</li>
            <li> It is very effective in removing food particles from between teeth.</li>
            <li> I am horrible at religiously flossing my teeth. I can floss every day for a week, but then I stop. There&#x27;s something that I just dread about putting both hands in my mouth and stringing something back and forth while it hurts and bleeds whathaveyou.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, last time I visited the DDS, she was saying that since I have the wisdom teeth (they never had to be pulled out) the gums behind the wisdom teeth can&#x27;t even be cleaned with floss OR a good electric toothbrush (I use a sonicare), and the ONLY way to clean back effectively there is with a Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;Having used an old countertop waterpik model from the 70s as a child, I was aware about what they were about, but living in an old NYC apartment with a small bathroom with no counter space, the large model was out of the question to my wife.&lt;br /&gt;With the cordless version there are obvious engineering disadvantages, one that you have to fit in a small form factor, therefore can&#x27;t keep nearly as much water in the reservoir, and you don&#x27;t have an unlimited power supply from the wall outlet.&lt;br /&gt;Considering how long the charge lasts, and that the waterpik is reasonably small, I think this was a good tradeoff.&lt;br /&gt;Although the power isn&#x27;t as high as the waterpik I used as a kid, it is enough to get the job done, I just have to fill the reservoir 2-3 times (as I only use the high setting)&lt;br /&gt;Overall for what it is, its amazing. If you have the counter real estate, I say, go ahead and get the countertop version, you won&#x27;t regret it. If you don&#x27;t have that option, or plan on traveling a lot, this waterpik is a great pick.</li>
            <li> Had to rturn this. Very messy to use, better off getting regular plug in model.</li>
            <li> it needs to be recharged daily there is no indication that the charge is comploete</li>
