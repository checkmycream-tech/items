    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>We put some ointments on the skin to help and these gloves are perfect to wear over the ointment.  </li>
            <li>Gloves work well for overnight use and they wash great!</li>
            <li>Great gloves</li>
            <li>and our hands get a moisturizing treatment that is great.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps now I would win the battle with my lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a very nice set of gloves that seem to do what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>These gloves make a nice treatment for my hands at night!</li>
            <li>The gloves work well and fit perfect.  </li>
            <li>They fit perfect and are of good quality.</li>
            <li>They are quite stretchy, but I feel they are best utilized by those who have medium to large hands on up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gloves stay on all night, great fit.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m kind of picky about seams--</li>
            <li>They are nice cotton gloves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a pair of gloves specifically for moisturizing, but these work nicely.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get these gloves to review.</li>
            <li>She found the ideal time to wear them was when she came home and relaxed at first, sitting around the tv room.</li>
            <li>They arrived in great shape and came quickly.  </li>
            <li>They are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these gloves for months, they work well (way better than using lotion without gloves) and wash well in the washing machine.  </li>
            <li>They will lock in moisture and when used with your favorite lotion, will soften up your hands.  </li>
            <li>The description makes it sound like they are impregnated with moisturizer, but I think they&#x27;re just meant to keep your own moisturizer from getting on the bed sheets.  </li>
            <li>I thought they should be made better</li>
            <li>I love these gloves, I plan on buying 3 more.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Then put on more, then put on some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Slather on a lot of your favorite hand cream, pull on the gloves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid I lot more for.</li>
            <li>I have medium hands and the gloves fit nicely.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these gloves; I wear them overnight.</li>
            <li>Love the gloves.</li>
            <li>should be able to use these comfortably.</li>
            <li>They stretch across the width as well, leading me to believe they will fit comfortably in most situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest that they should be available in more than one size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They feel like they are a cotton, spandex mix and will be easy to toss into the wash.  </li>
            <li>the stitching looks like it would tear easily upon trying to put them on.</li>
            <li>Otherwise they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>any case, they fit fine and do help to retain the moisturizer on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sure, the seams aren&#x27;t perfect (as other reviews have noted) but they are also pretty inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>and so either glove can fit on either hand.  </li>
            <li>She tried to wear them during the day, but she works on the computer a lot, and she wasn&#x27;t comfortable typing with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product free from the manufacturer in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li>The fabric is like a stretchy cotton, light as a feather, and the gloves themselves don&#x27;t inhibit movement.</li>
            <li>Keeping them moisturized is really important if this matters to you.</li>
            <li>I loved them enough that I bought a pair for my mom.  :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;While my daughter first liked them when she put them on, finding them to be “gently moisturizing,” she quickly began to fret over their smell, which she found kind of mildewy.</li>
            <li>My hands take a beating every day, and I appreciate having special gloves to pamper them at night.  </li>
            <li>in all, my daughter was able however to come to certain conclusions about the gloves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They aren’t really form fitting</li>
            <li>She could feel the moisturizer in them, but she could not take full advantage of them.</li>
            <li>She could feel the moisturizer in them, but she could not take full advantage of them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Working in the garden is fun, but we like to do it without garden gloves on, we enjoy the feel of the dirt on our hands as we plant, weed and just garden.  </li>
            <li>They are also very comfortable and can be used while doing normal housework things like dusting.</li>
            <li>Seems the same as if I didn&#x27;t wear them,  but the fit, color and  material are nice for the price.  </li>
            <li>They keep the moisturizer from dissipating too quickly so you get a lot of hand-healing and softening while you sleep.  </li>
            <li>I try to use moisturizer every night, but I never seem to be able to work it in well enough and end up with more on my bed linens than on my hands.  </li>
            <li>: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.worth of the gloves.</li>
            <li>: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.</li>
            <li>She could feel the moisturizing element of the gloves themselves, but as her hand did not fully contact all areas of the gloves, she felt she did not get the full extent of the worth of the gloves.</li>
            <li>The gloves are easy to slip on, soft, fit well and allow for projects around the house or evening just holding a book while relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I have large hands and these fit me</li>
            <li>They are soft and feel lovely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a complimentary pair of BelleSha Ultra Moisturizing Hand Gloves for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample to test for my review.</li>
            <li>Absorbed all of the moisturizer that I put on my hands...</li>
            <li>Personally though I will probably just continue to use lotion on my hands without gloves as though these are comfortable I am just too set in my ways to fall asleep easily with them on my hands.  </li>
            <li>They are a very soft cotton that are quite comfortable to wear, even if you aren’t putting any moisturizing cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very comfortable and don&#x27;t make my hands feel hot, likely a result of the breathability.</li>
            <li>They are comfy and I&#x27;m hardly aware that I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
            <li>This was the first time my wife tried a product like this, and she says the BelleSha Breathable Ultra Moisturizing Hand Gloves work well.</li>
            <li>I put vaseline on my hands first.</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>Not too hot, either.</li>
            <li>And they don&#x27;t make hands feel hot or clammy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of us already use hand lotion, but older skin sometimes needs a little more help.</li>
            <li>She is able to put certain kinds of hand cream on at night and the gloves help keep the cream on her hands and are aiding not only in softening but in healing her hands.  </li>
            <li>These are low to middle in terms of price, and about as good as some</li>
            <li>, it definitely helped me, and I feel my hands are looking much softer and more supple than before use.</li>
            <li>As I have grown older I have definitely seen the need to take better care of my hands.  </li>
            <li>A tiny rip in one of the seams, easy to repair.</li>
            <li>Easy and simply to use.</li>
            <li>The size of these gloves is what I would call women&#x27;s large.  </li>
            <li>and I certainly would not buy again.</li>
            <li>My hands are a good average at least, and these fit well and are comfortable.</li>
            <li>These work just fine and seem well made, but I just found them not something I could wear the entire night.</li>
            <li>I am finally ready to report on these.  </li>
            <li>The material just doesn&#x27;t have enough stretch to fit all size</li>
            <li>As product advertised,  just really haven&#x27;t seen much of a change.  </li>
            <li>These did not hold up very well.  </li>
            <li>More pink than I thought they would be - just sayin&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The whole time getting a moisturizing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are light and breathable gloves, but quite short for my hand.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t pet the cats too much.</li>
            <li>If only they had a glove that fit the rest of me...</li>
            <li>Second, she believed that the gloves would very much be helpful to people of larger hands than she – which is most of the world, she admitted.</li>
            <li>Give me other colors :)</li>
            <li>gloves fit my small hands and are extremely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>if you have an extra large hand most likely these would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, I remember my grandma wearing white cotton gloves to bed with special healing lotion underneath.</li>
            <li>note, though: My wife has large hands (long fingers), and she was pleasantly surprised that the gloves fit her.</li>
            <li>They were not too heavy but were actually quite light weight and comfortable.</li>
            <li>My hands feel better after just a few days.</li>
            <li>They allowed me to use a thicker layer of cream on my hands than I normally would, and helped my hands recover from the abuse of a day of washing dishes, gardening, carrying boxes up into our attic, scrubbing the stains out of baseball pants, etc.  </li>
            <li>put my lotion on as normal and put each gloves on.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the real problem with the gloves she found another problem, and this really became their downfall: they were just too big for her.</li>
            <li>They are very soft as well.</li>
            <li>I have normal adult woman&#x27;s hands</li>
            <li>have VERY small hands and while these fit me gently around the palms, they are long in the fingers, meaning those with more normal (average to large)</li>
            <li>These are light weight, they keep the lotion from getting all over the place and making a mess.</li>
            <li>These popped up, they will not fit a guy , my husband does not have huge hands and still couldnt squeeze in them.</li>
            <li>The pink color is definitely girly, and the fabric is a smooth cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fabric is soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>I use spa gloves occasionally when they need a fast rescue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done this for years and so far have avoided the quilty skin and bulgy veins.  </li>
            <li>The glove material is soft and breathable without feeling flimsy.</li>
            <li>My hands actually feel much softer since the lotion has to stay  where it is suppose to be, and do what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>When I put them on my own small hands, they are baggy and way too loose to help my hands absorb the moisture from my hand cream.  </li>
            <li>Usually one-size-fits-all gloves are slightly too small, but these were perfect.</li>
            <li>It is useful not worth the price</li>
            <li>and I could barely got into these plus</li>
            <li>I do like the pretty in pink color, but only wish they had specified size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the size, I was unable to find these gloves effective, so I cannot recommend them for women with</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, she believed that unwrapping them and taking them out of their containers helped to remove the mild but somewhat stale smell they had at first.</li>
            <li>This, however, she did not hold against the gloves: my daughter has had extremely small hands, and is actually teased because of the special order they have had to put in for a smaller size of surgical gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used them several nights now, and other than the unusual feeling of wearing gloves to bed, I like them.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s not sure how long they will last, but for now they are working fine and making a difference, so she recommends them to anyone wanting extra moisturizing for their hands.</li>
            <li>the end of the week moved closer, she tried several times to use the gloves – as a veterinarian, she often deals with all kinds of animals (and owners) and frequently washes her hands and, as a result has terribly dry hands.</li>
            <li>Although they may work for average and large women&#x27;s hands, these gloves are too large for small hands.  </li>

            <li> A tiny rip in one of the seams, easy to repair.</li>
            <li> Easy and simply to use.</li>
            <li> The size of these gloves is what I would call women&#x27;s large.  </li>
            <li> and I certainly would not buy again.</li>
            <li> My hands are a good average at least, and these fit well and are comfortable.</li>
            <li> These work just fine and seem well made, but I just found them not something I could wear the entire night.</li>
            <li> I am finally ready to report on these.  </li>
            <li> The material just doesn&#x27;t have enough stretch to fit all size</li>
            <li> As product advertised,  just really haven&#x27;t seen much of a change.  </li>
            <li> These did not hold up very well.  </li>
            <li> More pink than I thought they would be - just sayin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The whole time getting a moisturizing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are light and breathable gloves, but quite short for my hand.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t pet the cats too much.</li>
            <li> If only they had a glove that fit the rest of me...</li>
            <li> Second, she believed that the gloves would very much be helpful to people of larger hands than she – which is most of the world, she admitted.</li>
            <li> Give me other colors :)</li>
            <li> gloves fit my small hands and are extremely comfortable.  </li>
            <li> if you have an extra large hand most likely these would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, I remember my grandma wearing white cotton gloves to bed with special healing lotion underneath.</li>
            <li> note, though: My wife has large hands (long fingers), and she was pleasantly surprised that the gloves fit her.</li>
            <li> They were not too heavy but were actually quite light weight and comfortable.</li>
            <li> My hands feel better after just a few days.</li>
            <li> They allowed me to use a thicker layer of cream on my hands than I normally would, and helped my hands recover from the abuse of a day of washing dishes, gardening, carrying boxes up into our attic, scrubbing the stains out of baseball pants, etc.  </li>
            <li> put my lotion on as normal and put each gloves on.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the real problem with the gloves she found another problem, and this really became their downfall: they were just too big for her.</li>
            <li> They are very soft as well.</li>
            <li> I have normal adult woman&#x27;s hands</li>
            <li> have VERY small hands and while these fit me gently around the palms, they are long in the fingers, meaning those with more normal (average to large)</li>
            <li> These are light weight, they keep the lotion from getting all over the place and making a mess.</li>
            <li> These popped up, they will not fit a guy , my husband does not have huge hands and still couldnt squeeze in them.</li>
            <li> The pink color is definitely girly, and the fabric is a smooth cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fabric is soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> I use spa gloves occasionally when they need a fast rescue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this for years and so far have avoided the quilty skin and bulgy veins.  </li>
            <li> The glove material is soft and breathable without feeling flimsy.</li>
            <li> My hands actually feel much softer since the lotion has to stay  where it is suppose to be, and do what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> When I put them on my own small hands, they are baggy and way too loose to help my hands absorb the moisture from my hand cream.  </li>
            <li> Usually one-size-fits-all gloves are slightly too small, but these were perfect.</li>
            <li> It is useful not worth the price</li>
            <li> and I could barely got into these plus</li>
            <li> I do like the pretty in pink color, but only wish they had specified size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the size, I was unable to find these gloves effective, so I cannot recommend them for women with</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, she believed that unwrapping them and taking them out of their containers helped to remove the mild but somewhat stale smell they had at first.</li>
            <li> This, however, she did not hold against the gloves: my daughter has had extremely small hands, and is actually teased because of the special order they have had to put in for a smaller size of surgical gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them several nights now, and other than the unusual feeling of wearing gloves to bed, I like them.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s not sure how long they will last, but for now they are working fine and making a difference, so she recommends them to anyone wanting extra moisturizing for their hands.</li>
            <li> the end of the week moved closer, she tried several times to use the gloves – as a veterinarian, she often deals with all kinds of animals (and owners) and frequently washes her hands and, as a result has terribly dry hands.</li>
            <li> Although they may work for average and large women&#x27;s hands, these gloves are too large for small hands.  </li>
            <li> She wears them several nights a week, and she has noticed a difference in how soft her hands are (especially after such a long, dry winter).</li>
            <li> (When I told her none of the other reviewers echoed her comments about the smell she was surprised.)</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re thin enough that they&#x27;re comfortable to wear for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> The small size is still a tad large for her but still workable.  </li>
            <li> I have an adult daughter with Down Syndrome.</li>
            <li> And that was her final conclusion: that women with hands bigger than hers – that is, of average or larger hands – would probably find these gloves to be a big help.</li>
            <li> And that was her final conclusion: that women with hands bigger than hers – that is, of average or larger hands – would probably find these gloves to be a big help.</li>
            <li> My daughters hands were so dry and cracking and this has brought moisture back to them</li>
            <li> These gloves have short, wide/thick fingers, and they are too short and wide for my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Or at least not too much.</li>
            <li> have long, slender fingers.  </li>
            <li> She found it lasted for her quite a long time, but she does admit to being a stickler about scent.</li>
            <li> If your hands are extra small or extra big, you may need to look further for sizes to accommodate your needs.ommodate your needs.</li>
            <li> She could not take them to bed or wear them for a very long time in fact because the smell bothered her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The idea of moisturizing gloves has been around for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I use them at night after I put on oils or creams, (really dry hands in the fall/winter).  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so dry over the winter that my knuckles often crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> These gloves do work well to moisturize and soften dry hands.  </li>
            <li> Her skin is also quite dry and easilyl irritated.</li>
            <li> Has been helping with my dry winter hands.  </li>
            <li> My hands aren&#x27;t that big, they&#x27;re just long and slender but these felt so tight on.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;d be loose,</li>
            <li> But it always left our hands dried out by the end of the day in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin that&#x27;s exposed to harsh substances needs extra care too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the lotion getting on my pillow case or sheets, I had no problems with them slipping off and have used them every night.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they tend to come off in the middle of the night, but other than that, I would, and probably will, purchase again.</li>
            <li> But she did believe that other women would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Some readers complain that they are made for average sized hands.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> A pair of plain cotton gloves that happen to be pink.</li>
            <li> Fits well and the slight elasticity keeps the gloves on all night.</li>
            <li> I garden and after wrestling with the roses, spraying, pruning, adding stuff to the soil, doing all those little jobs, my hands look like I&#x27;ve been pulling a barge down the canal.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Hands are a dead giveaway in showing age.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money for the gloves and waste of money for the moisturizer that moisturized the gloves and not my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also very tight.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am finally ready to report on these.  They arrived in great shape and came quickly.  They are soft and feel lovely.  I use them at night after I put on oils or creams, (really dry hands in the fall/winter).  My only complaint is that they tend to come off in the middle of the night, but other than that, I would, and probably will, purchase again.</li>
            <li> Bought these after looking up moisturizing gloves for men. These popped up, they will not fit a guy , my husband does not have huge hands and still couldnt squeeze in them.</li>
            <li> gloves fit my small hands and are extremely comfortable.  I wear them at night after using my hand ointment.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Too small for my medium hands.  Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> These moisturizing gloves do the trick.  I lather up and put them on.  They are comfy and I&#x27;m hardly aware that I&#x27;m wearing them. My hands feel better after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these gloves for months, they work well (way better than using lotion without gloves) and wash well in the washing machine.  Sure, the seams aren&#x27;t perfect (as other reviews have noted) but they are also pretty inexpensive.  I loved them enough that I bought a pair for my mom.  :)</li>
            <li> These gloves make a nice treatment for my hands at night!</li>
            <li> These gloves are no better than the ones you can buy at the dollar store.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was the first time my wife tried a product like this, and she says the BelleSha Breathable Ultra Moisturizing Hand Gloves work well. She can tell the difference in her hands after wearing them over her regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn&#x27;t wear then daily, but uses them off and on throughout the week. She&#x27;s not sure how long they will last, but for now they are working fine and making a difference, so she recommends them to anyone wanting extra moisturizing for their hands.</li>
            <li> This pair of gloves is not one-size-fits-all.  The material just doesn&#x27;t have enough stretch to fit all size hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, slender fingers.  I wear a size &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; glove to accommodate my finger length, not my finger width.  These gloves have short, wide/thick fingers, and they are too short and wide for my fingers.  I can&#x27;t wear these gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the seams annoying, too--but I&#x27;m kind of picky about seams--someone else might not be bothered by the seam.  They are thick and  run through the middle of the glove, up from the wrist, then up and down each finger, to end at the wrist on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from BelleSha.</li>
            <li> I have extra-dry, average sized hands. They&#x27;re so dry over the winter that my knuckles often crack and bleed. I&#x27;ve been wearing these overnight with lotion... or, at least, half the night. I can fall asleep with them on, but I find that if I wake up in the middle of the night, they annoy me and I pull them off. Not sure why... maybe they get hot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, they fit fine and do help to retain the moisturizer on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing gloves are designed to give your hands that extra boost to help soften them.  No, these aren’t gel gloves and aren’t lined.  They are a very soft cotton that are quite comfortable to wear, even if you aren’t putting any moisturizing cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are often called “spa gloves,” and sometimes can command a premium price.  Unfortunately these are not one size fits all.  They are quite stretchy, but I feel they are best utilized by those who have medium to large hands on up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows whether or not they have small hands, but the way to gauge that is to measure around the palm.  A medium glove would be 8” around the palm so you can keep that in mind when ordering.  The are quite stretchy, so if you have an extra large hand most likely these would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren’t really form fitting and so either glove can fit on either hand.  They will lock in moisture and when used with your favorite lotion, will soften up your hands.  They feel like they are a cotton, spandex mix and will be easy to toss into the wash.  I do like the pretty in pink color, but only wish they had specified size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> A little too small/tight even for my small hands but the gloves will stretch with time.</li>
            <li> They are nice cotton gloves.  As product advertised,  just really haven&#x27;t seen much of a change.  Seems the same as if I didn&#x27;t wear them,  but the fit, color and  material are nice for the price.  Shipping was kinda slow, but I ordered a few items and I am not sure which item held up the shipping.</li>
            <li> It is useful not worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a pair of gloves specifically for moisturizing, but these work nicely.  The description makes it sound like they are impregnated with moisturizer, but I think they&#x27;re just meant to keep your own moisturizer from getting on the bed sheets.  The pink color is definitely girly, and the fabric is a smooth cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them several nights now, and other than the unusual feeling of wearing gloves to bed, I like them.  They allowed me to use a thicker layer of cream on my hands than I normally would, and helped my hands recover from the abuse of a day of washing dishes, gardening, carrying boxes up into our attic, scrubbing the stains out of baseball pants, etc.  My hands take a beating every day, and I appreciate having special gloves to pamper them at night.  The size of these gloves is what I would call women&#x27;s large.  I have large hands and these fit me perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary pair of BelleSha Ultra Moisturizing Hand Gloves for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> I encouraged one of my daughters to wear these for a week, and they did not make it. Yet things were not a total loss, as you’ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my daughter first liked them when she put them on, finding them to be “gently moisturizing,” she quickly began to fret over their smell, which she found kind of mildewy. She found it lasted for her quite a long time, but she does admit to being a stickler about scent. She could not take them to bed or wear them for a very long time in fact because the smell bothered her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the end of the week moved closer, she tried several times to use the gloves – as a veterinarian, she often deals with all kinds of animals (and owners) and frequently washes her hands and, as a result has terribly dry hands. She found the ideal time to wear them was when she came home and relaxed at first, sitting around the tv room. She even grew to disregard the scent a bit (or just got used to the odor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real problem with the gloves she found another problem, and this really became their downfall: they were just too big for her. This, however, she did not hold against the gloves: my daughter has had extremely small hands, and is actually teased because of the special order they have had to put in for a smaller size of surgical gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, my daughter was able however to come to certain conclusions about the gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, she believed that unwrapping them and taking them out of their containers helped to remove the mild but somewhat stale smell they had at first. (When I told her none of the other reviewers echoed her comments about the smell she was surprised.) Second, she believed that the gloves would very much be helpful to people of larger hands than she – which is most of the world, she admitted. She could feel the moisturizing element of the gloves themselves, but as her hand did not fully contact all areas of the gloves, she felt she did not get the full extent of the worth of the gloves. And that was her final conclusion: that women with hands bigger than hers – that is, of average or larger hands – would probably find these gloves to be a big help. She could feel the moisturizer in them, but she could not take full advantage of them. But she did believe that other women would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.worth of the gloves. And that was her final conclusion: that women with hands bigger than hers – that is, of average or larger hands – would probably find these gloves to be a big help. She could feel the moisturizer in them, but she could not take full advantage of them. But she did believe that other women would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.</li>
            <li> Rip off...small (and I have small hands), not breathable...</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife a few weeks ago. She wears them several nights a week, and she has noticed a difference in how soft her hands are (especially after such a long, dry winter). She just puts on some lotion, pulls the gloves on, and she&#x27;s done. She tried to wear them during the day, but she works on the computer a lot, and she wasn&#x27;t comfortable typing with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, though: My wife has large hands (long fingers), and she was pleasantly surprised that the gloves fit her. Usually one-size-fits-all gloves are slightly too small, but these were perfect. So if you have small hands, these might be too big for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, but they do help when paired with hand lotion. And they&#x27;re thin enough that they&#x27;re comfortable to wear for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> The idea of moisturizing gloves has been around for a very long time. In fact, I remember my grandma wearing white cotton gloves to bed with special healing lotion underneath. I never knew that I would grow up and do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY small hands and while these fit me gently around the palms, they are long in the fingers, meaning those with more normal (average to large) should be able to use these comfortably. They stretch across the width as well, leading me to believe they will fit comfortably in most situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very comfortable and don&#x27;t make my hands feel hot, likely a result of the breathability. Just a very nice set of gloves that seem to do what they are supposed to do. Five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample to test for my review.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife and she loves them.  She is able to put certain kinds of hand cream on at night and the gloves help keep the cream on her hands and are aiding not only in softening but in healing her hands.  We have purchased 3 pair now so they can be rotated and washed regularly.  They are very soft as well.</li>
            <li> Great gloves although the fingers all seem a bit short.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. My fiancé purchased these to aid in overnight moisturizing, and they are terrible. The fingers don&#x27;t line up properly, they are baggy, and the stitching is awful. Save yourself the money, and buy somewhere else.</li>
            <li> These gloves do work well to moisturize and soften dry hands.  Personally though I will probably just continue to use lotion on my hands without gloves as though these are comfortable I am just too set in my ways to fall asleep easily with them on my hands.  I am usually doing something with my hands when watching TV,listening to music etc that they are not that practical for my personal use.  I received this product free from the manufacturer in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> bought these and then found similar ones in the dollar store....for, yep, you guessed it, a dollar!  Can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I have normal adult woman&#x27;s hands and I could barely got into these plus the stitching looks like it would tear easily upon trying to put them on. I am returning these and am very disappointed as I was hoping they would work.</li>
            <li> The gloves work well and fit perfect.  The fabric is soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> These did not hold up very well.  I thought they should be made better</li>
            <li> I love these gloves, I plan on buying 3 more. I live in Florida and I sleep with these gloves on. I put vaseline on my hands first. They are very comfortable. My hands don&#x27;t sweat. The gloves stay on all night, great fit. Pretty color. These wash up well also, did not put them in the dryer, they dried in 1 day.hanging on a drying rack. Love these.</li>
            <li> More pink than I thought they would be - just sayin&#x27;. These work just fine and seem well made, but I just found them not something I could wear the entire night.</li>
            <li> Absorbed all of the moisturizer that I put on my hands...so my hands were actually drier when I woke up in the morning. Waste of money for the gloves and waste of money for the moisturizer that moisturized the gloves and not my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also very tight. My hands aren&#x27;t that big, they&#x27;re just long and slender but these felt so tight on.</li>
            <li> We received this product from the Manufacturer asking us to try them out and then post a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working in the garden is fun, but we like to do it without garden gloves on, we enjoy the feel of the dirt on our hands as we plant, weed and just garden.  But it always left our hands dried out by the end of the day in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, come in to the house and put on moisturizer.  Then put on more, then put on some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we come in an put on these gloves for a while while doing things around the house and our hands get a moisturizing treatment that is great.  The gloves are easy to slip on, soft, fit well and allow for projects around the house or evening just holding a book while relaxing.  The whole time getting a moisturizing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these things are going to be a big hit.  BUT again, &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34;.  Give me other colors :)</li>
            <li> These are light and breathable gloves, but quite short for my hand.</li>
            <li> Fits well and the slight elasticity keeps the gloves on all night. Not too hot, either. A tiny rip in one of the seams, easy to repair. I&#x27;ll buy another pair when these wear out.</li>
            <li> Most of us already use hand lotion, but older skin sometimes needs a little more help. Skin that&#x27;s exposed to harsh substances needs extra care too. I garden and after wrestling with the roses, spraying, pruning, adding stuff to the soil, doing all those little jobs, my hands look like I&#x27;ve been pulling a barge down the canal.  I use spa gloves occasionally when they need a fast rescue. They keep the moisturizer from dissipating too quickly so you get a lot of hand-healing and softening while you sleep.  Slather on a lot of your favorite hand cream, pull on the gloves. That&#x27;s all. These are light weight, they keep the lotion from getting all over the place and making a mess. I can use my Kindle with no problem. Just don&#x27;t pet the cats too much. The gloves like to pick up cat hair. These are low to middle in terms of price, and about as good as some I&#x27;ve paid I lot more for. The fabric is like a stretchy cotton, light as a feather, and the gloves themselves don&#x27;t inhibit movement. Or at least not too much. If you like picking up dimes instead of counting sheep at night, you&#x27;ll have a problem. Otherwise they&#x27;re fine. And they don&#x27;t make hands feel hot or clammy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands are a dead giveaway in showing age.  Keeping them moisturized is really important if this matters to you. Use moisturizing gloves a couple of times a week if your hands are starting to show their age. I&#x27;ve done this for years and so far have avoided the quilty skin and bulgy veins.  If only they had a glove that fit the rest of me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I received these from the manufacturer for review and I&#x27;m giving them five stars. They&#x27;re everything you want in a moisturizing glove, no problems.  Some readers complain that they are made for average sized hands.  My hands are a good average at least, and these fit well and are comfortable. Any bigger and they&#x27;d be loose, any smaller and they&#x27;d be tight.  If your hands are extra small or extra big, you may need to look further for sizes to accommodate your needs.ommodate your needs.</li>
            <li> Although they may work for average and large women&#x27;s hands, these gloves are too large for small hands.  When I put them on my own small hands, they are baggy and way too loose to help my hands absorb the moisture from my hand cream.  I suggest that they should be available in more than one size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the size, I was unable to find these gloves effective, so I cannot recommend them for women with small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  The manufacturer provided me a sample to review.</li>
            <li> I have an adult daughter with Down Syndrome. Her hands are very small. Her skin is also quite dry and easilyl irritated. We put some ointments on the skin to help and these gloves are perfect to wear over the ointment.  The small size is still a tad large for her but still workable.  The glove material is soft and breathable without feeling flimsy.</li>
            <li> Easy and simply to use. Works well overnight. My daughters hands were so dry and cracking and this has brought moisture back to them</li>
            <li> As I have grown older I have definitely seen the need to take better care of my hands.  I try to use moisturizer every night, but I never seem to be able to work it in well enough and end up with more on my bed linens than on my hands.  I was thrilled to get these gloves to review. Perhaps now I would win the battle with my lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my lotion on as normal and put each gloves on.  I have medium hands and the gloves fit nicely. They were not too heavy but were actually quite light weight and comfortable. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the lotion getting on my pillow case or sheets, I had no problems with them slipping off and have used them every night. My hands actually feel much softer since the lotion has to stay  where it is suppose to be, and do what it is suppose to do. I like this product, it definitely helped me, and I feel my hands are looking much softer and more supple than before use. I will continue to use them and again am thankful for the opportunity of reviewing them.</li>
            <li> A pair of plain cotton gloves that happen to be pink. Not worth the price and I certainly would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these gloves; I wear them overnight. My hands have a different story now!</li>
            <li> Gloves work well for overnight use and they wash great!</li>
            <li> Love the gloves. They fit perfect and are of good quality. They are also very comfortable and can be used while doing normal housework things like dusting. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Has been helping with my dry winter hands.  Buy a pair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
