            <li>It works well as a light moisturizer throughout the day when you feel a little dry and adds a nice dewy glow if you apply it over makeup.</li>
            <li>na try to be a little more helpful--this spritz has a real effect.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on clean, dry skin, but it also works as a make-up set and hair refresher.  </li>

            <li> Love this mist. Fresh and moisturizing, I keep it in my office and mist my face to add moisture and refresh my makeup during the day. Great value. Perfect for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mist I have ever purchased so far,&lt;br /&gt;My first order was 3 bottles before Christmas.My teenagers also love it. I gave one bottle to my friend when I found this gem. She called me right after she used once and said she was going to order 1 dozen!!!!! And she introduced to all her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mist is very mild, ( I guess no alcohol) the scent is just wonderful , not overpower. It help hydration and prevent acne and pore. The mist design is just lovely. it is  perfect volume and easy to control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Snail Repair Gel for a couple of months and saw improvement in the amount of blemishes I had as well as a more even complexion. I decided to give the Hydro Mist a try. In the morning, I went about my regular face routine and added a little spray of mist to help some of the dryness I was feeling. My face felt greasy within an hour. It didn&#x27;t feel like I had an over-production of sebum, but like a thick film over my face. Immediately I washed the product off. I tried to give it one more chance, but unfortunately, I got the same results. I definitely will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and it works well with mizon snail cream. Kinda help with my ace skin.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff. refreshing an soothing.  perfect for setting make- up, moistening face or just freshening up. wish they had an airplane friendly bottle / size.</li>
            <li> Amazing product leaves your face well hydrated and makeup set for the entire day!!!! Perfect def buying it again</li>
            <li> It is sticky and makes me shiny but I use it at my desk over makeup instead of during my skincare regiment. It smells nice, is very cute and the mist is fairly fine.</li>
            <li> Not sticky and dries quickly. Good to use even with make up.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing &amp; moisturizing. I have combination, sensitive, blemish prime skin. And it didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and makes my face feels hydrated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely addicted to this product. It&#x27;s such a light refreshing mist that hydrates my skin In such a pleasant and versatile fashion that I can&#x27;t imagine living without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cooling and hydrating and very pleasing. It&#x27;s a unique way to hydrate skin while delivering the benefits of snail filtrate at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often use it to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my makeup. But I use it several times throughout the day or night just to keep my dry middle aged skin fresh and dewey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> No complaints!!! It keeps my face moist and healthy. I can feel it repairing my skin!</li>
            <li> The best.  I won&#x27;t tell my boyfriends what&#x27;s in it anymore, though.  They are very faint of heart.  ETA:  Gonna try to be a little more helpful--this spritz has a real effect.  I thought it must have hyaluronic acid, because it seems to make skin plump and dewy that way, but no.  Snail slime is apparently just *that* awesome.  I spray it on clean, dry skin, but it also works as a make-up set and hair refresher.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all to me, so I&#x27;m not sure about the review that mentions greasiness.  It&#x27;s just not--it feels like cooling water and leaves no sense of residue.  At most, I could say it gives me the feeling that my skin is plumped with moisture and &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; with a perfect finish for primer or straight to make-up.  Those are all good things, in my book.  This is always going to be one of my basic products that I use daily and take everywhere as effective first aid for tired, dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and lightly moisturizing! It works well as a light moisturizer throughout the day when you feel a little dry and adds a nice dewy glow if you apply it over makeup. Sprays a nice even mist and doesn&#x27;t have an intense fragrance. Lasted a couple of months for me with daily use.</li>
            <li> Nice fine mist that can leave small white droplets on my skin. This stuff either breaks me out and/or stings my face.</li>
            <li> Probably the best facial mist available. Very gentle n moist</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Does  what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I love misting this over my makeup.</li>
            <li> Mist is very light, hydrating and smells fantastic. Doesnt seem to break me out and got here in two days which is definitely a plus. Would repurchase once im out.</li>
            <li> Transportation is too slow</li>
    </ol>
