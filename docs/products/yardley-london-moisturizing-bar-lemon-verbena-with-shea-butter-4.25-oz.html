            <li>but I love the smell of the soap.</li>

            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>

            <li>and I love bathing with.</li>
            <li>verbena is my all time favorite...</li>
            <li>and I would consider buying more of these.</li>
            <li>love the fragrance and feel of this soap.</li>
            <li>Was an add on item and love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the lemon scent.</li>
            <li>I do love these soaps.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Hoped for more aroma from this product, and I do not like the shape of the bar.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it one more try on the hands in spring/summer.  </li>
            <li>I love Yardley&#x27;s all nature products.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter makes everything better.</li>
            <li>I love the way this soap smells...</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s better for me as a hand soap.</li>
            <li>Based on everyone else if you like a very strong aroma like avon or hose others it might not be your but also some said its too strong.</li>
            <li>This soap is very rich &amp; creamy.</li>
            <li>Scent is very clean smelling.</li>
            <li>Not to mention this is more easily found in grocery stores and Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great scent, and funny enough, I&#x27;ve even had a couple girls tell me how great it smells on my skin.</li>
            <li>it also arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>i love the smell of lemon and the shea butter leaves your skin so soft and refreshed the bar has lasted me for about 3 weeks and still smell so good</li>
            <li>Not to strong.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not saying it was an offensive smell, but it was strong.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a strong lemon aroma.  </li>
            <li>I do not like strong smells,</li>
            <li>but this is fine</li>
            <li>The soap lightly moisturizes your skin and leaves you feeling refreshed (not clogged).</li>
            <li>soap has a light verbena scent infused with lemon/citrus notes.  </li>
            <li>These items ship with qualifying orders over $25 and are eligible for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just cheap, crappy soap with some lemon scent in it.  </li>
            <li>I needed a fill in for free shipping and this worked.  </li>
            <li>So fresh and so clean :).</li>
            <li>This Yardley Lemon Verbena soap not only keeps you clean, but it also creates a great lemon scent where ever it is unleashed.</li>
            <li>Its ability to mask a multitude of sins, including irregular bathing, perhaps explains why this particular scent was so popular in the 1800s</li>
            <li>Thankfully, this item is available because of the new Add-on program, which allows Amazon to offer thousands of low-priced items that would be cost-prohibitive to ship on their own.</li>
            <li>First, I absolutely love verbena.  </li>
            <li>I actually am seeing my skin retain more moisture which is nice.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel special.</li>
            <li>But it does great, washes squeaky clean and has a lighter scent then expected.</li>
            <li>The good thing its only pay $1.00 for each item(I</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t a ton of ingredients in this soap, and it has a lovely gentle scent.</li>
            <li>I wanted soap that smelled like Verbena without having to pay a million dollars for SOAP - this smells more like lemon - my boyfriend likes it because it&#x27;s kind of a deodorant soap - cheap and smells sorta like it - but not what I expected</li>
            <li>I also love the gentle way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a non-acidic sweet verbena).</li>
            <li>Fresh scent with a nice lather, this bar soap that leaves skin feeling clean not dry.</li>
            <li>Not only do I love to use it in the shower, but I want to get some bars as fragrance for my drawers!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The one things it leaves behind is a delightful mild lemon verbena scent.  </li>
            <li>I found this soap very unique because it lathers very well, washes off clean, and leaves my skin soft and lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even at the end of the day, my &#x27;female companion&#x27; notes that my skin smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this natural soap.</li>
            <li>The soap presents a fresh scent that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was not a disappointment and lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>I beilve its mild but its a very earthy mild lemon</li>
            <li>price is just right &amp; wished they sold it in stores in a pack size.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap to round out a gift card - so it turned out to be a nice filler!</li>
            <li>It smells nice and lasts long.  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell not only lemony but very  very flowery also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As always with Yardley, you get natural ingredients that are easy on your skin.</li>
            <li>makes skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this soap at first</li>
            <li>I first tried it as a bath soap during the summer...</li>
            <li>A good quality soap for dry and sensitive hands.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and easily breaks out with highly fragranced products.  </li>
            <li>I like this soap quite a bit, and will almost certainly buy more of it in the future.  </li>
            <li>Lemon is  such a clean, zesty smell!  </li>
            <li>You can put in your laundry and it makes the entire room smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap expecting it to be mild because it is supposed ot be natural.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a strong scent which is obviously lemon influenced</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the pure lemon fragrance like the soap I used to buy from Avon.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this soap, but it made my skin so dry.</li>
            <li>This soap made a nice little gift accompaniment for a friend.  </li>
            <li>It also suds really well.  </li>
            <li>but it really grew on me</li>
            <li>I have to say, being a guy, I don&#x27;t think about body soap too much.</li>
            <li>I really adore this soap.</li>
            <li>Yardley Lemon Vernena with Sheal Butter bar is a very pleasing scented soap.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like their fragrances as much as Yardley&#x27;s Verbena.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive</li>
            <li>The scent is not over-powering but, in fact, very pleasing.</li>
            <li>, I ended up throwing the whole bar of soap away after one use.</li>
            <li>Our sons, Kai (age 10) and Kou (age 8) are nearly finished watching the third season of [[ASIN</li>
            <li>I still like the other one I had better</li>
            <li>It did keep my skin clean, but it also left a film on my skin that made the water bead every time I used it.</li>
            <li>Nice soap,, I just paid far too much for it here which is why I rated it 3stars,  I actually found it in my local Wegmans for .89cents</li>
            <li>I really like Yardley soaps, and have used them for years, and this new addition is a real winner.</li>
            <li>Pleasant enough as soap goes, but I bought it specifically for the lemon verbena scent, and that is missing.</li>
            <li>I am a new fan of this one!</li>
            <li>Ultimately, we tested the bar in the shower and the whole household had the distinct smell of Lemon Verbena.</li>
            <li>a classic London brand(since 1770)that manufactures high quality items.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this soap since it is being advertised as being made with lemon verbena and shea butter</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>This item is an inexpensive luxury that I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I would much rather use natural soaps made from plant-derived ingredients so I will not be purchasing Yardley again.</li>
            <li>Also, doesn&#x27;t seem to dry me out which is a big deal :)</li>
            <li>It has a very nice smell and last about the same as other soaps of similar quality</li>
            <li>what lemon verbena even is, which is evident by the illustration of lemon and a generic purple flower which doesn&#x27;t even look like verbena.  </li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive, so I am cautious about the soap that I use.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face soft and arrived on time</li>
            <li>Anyone who uses natural soap knows it&#x27;s ....</li>
            <li>Then come to find out that the main ingredient is actually Sodium Tallowate, which is basically animal fat.</li>
            <li>And by the way, most of the big brand name soaps are made from animal fats as the main ingredient, it&#x27;s usually listed as Sodium Tallowate in the ingredients or sometimes simply as just glycerine.</li>
            <li>Fresh and long lasting.</li>
            <li>1 bar will last probably a month of normal use showering.  </li>
            <li>At about a dollar a bar, the cost is entirely reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes and cleans at least as well as Dove, or any of the major brands - probably better.  </li>
            <li>Read the ingredient list on a bar of Yardley soap and compare it to any major store brand.</li>
            <li>i have since repurchased the item several times for the simple reason that it is slightly cheaper than buying it at a store and it is delivered to your door free and quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>They barely have any aroma whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how large and heavy this soap is.</li>
            <li>It does not dry your skin out like castile soap.</li>
            <li>Does not dry the skin.  </li>

            <li> I love the most</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say which makes them stay away more</li>
            <li> but I love the smell of the soap.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely a good back up and a great scent.</li>
            <li> So glad I opted to buy it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap.  </li>

            <li> Love this stuff for bathing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, able to get great deal as &amp;</li>
            <li> Now wish had bought more than 1.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li> and I love bathing with.</li>
            <li> verbena is my all time favorite...</li>
            <li> and I would consider buying more of these.</li>
            <li> love the fragrance and feel of this soap.</li>
            <li> Was an add on item and love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the lemon scent.</li>
            <li> I do love these soaps.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Hoped for more aroma from this product, and I do not like the shape of the bar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it one more try on the hands in spring/summer.  </li>
            <li> I love Yardley&#x27;s all nature products.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter makes everything better.</li>
            <li> I love the way this soap smells...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s better for me as a hand soap.</li>
            <li> Based on everyone else if you like a very strong aroma like avon or hose others it might not be your but also some said its too strong.</li>
            <li> This soap is very rich &amp; creamy.</li>
            <li> Scent is very clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Not to mention this is more easily found in grocery stores and Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great scent, and funny enough, I&#x27;ve even had a couple girls tell me how great it smells on my skin.</li>
            <li> it also arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of lemon and the shea butter leaves your skin so soft and refreshed the bar has lasted me for about 3 weeks and still smell so good</li>
            <li> Not to strong.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not saying it was an offensive smell, but it was strong.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a strong lemon aroma.  </li>
            <li> I do not like strong smells,</li>
            <li> but this is fine</li>
            <li> The soap lightly moisturizes your skin and leaves you feeling refreshed (not clogged).</li>
            <li> soap has a light verbena scent infused with lemon/citrus notes.  </li>
            <li> These items ship with qualifying orders over $25 and are eligible for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just cheap, crappy soap with some lemon scent in it.  </li>
            <li> I needed a fill in for free shipping and this worked.  </li>
            <li> So fresh and so clean :).</li>
            <li> This Yardley Lemon Verbena soap not only keeps you clean, but it also creates a great lemon scent where ever it is unleashed.</li>
            <li> Its ability to mask a multitude of sins, including irregular bathing, perhaps explains why this particular scent was so popular in the 1800s</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this item is available because of the new Add-on program, which allows Amazon to offer thousands of low-priced items that would be cost-prohibitive to ship on their own.</li>
            <li> First, I absolutely love verbena.  </li>
            <li> I actually am seeing my skin retain more moisture which is nice.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel special.</li>
            <li> But it does great, washes squeaky clean and has a lighter scent then expected.</li>
            <li> The good thing its only pay $1.00 for each item(I</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t a ton of ingredients in this soap, and it has a lovely gentle scent.</li>
            <li> I wanted soap that smelled like Verbena without having to pay a million dollars for SOAP - this smells more like lemon - my boyfriend likes it because it&#x27;s kind of a deodorant soap - cheap and smells sorta like it - but not what I expected</li>
            <li> I also love the gentle way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a non-acidic sweet verbena).</li>
            <li> Fresh scent with a nice lather, this bar soap that leaves skin feeling clean not dry.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love to use it in the shower, but I want to get some bars as fragrance for my drawers!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The one things it leaves behind is a delightful mild lemon verbena scent.  </li>
            <li> I found this soap very unique because it lathers very well, washes off clean, and leaves my skin soft and lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even at the end of the day, my &#x27;female companion&#x27; notes that my skin smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of this natural soap.</li>
            <li> The soap presents a fresh scent that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was not a disappointment and lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I beilve its mild but its a very earthy mild lemon</li>
            <li> price is just right &amp; wished they sold it in stores in a pack size.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to round out a gift card - so it turned out to be a nice filler!</li>
            <li> It smells nice and lasts long.  </li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell not only lemony but very  very flowery also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As always with Yardley, you get natural ingredients that are easy on your skin.</li>
            <li> makes skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this soap at first</li>
            <li> I first tried it as a bath soap during the summer...</li>
            <li> A good quality soap for dry and sensitive hands.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and easily breaks out with highly fragranced products.  </li>
            <li> I like this soap quite a bit, and will almost certainly buy more of it in the future.  </li>
            <li> Lemon is  such a clean, zesty smell!  </li>
            <li> You can put in your laundry and it makes the entire room smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap expecting it to be mild because it is supposed ot be natural.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a strong scent which is obviously lemon influenced</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the pure lemon fragrance like the soap I used to buy from Avon.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this soap, but it made my skin so dry.</li>
            <li> This soap made a nice little gift accompaniment for a friend.  </li>
            <li> It also suds really well.  </li>
            <li> but it really grew on me</li>
            <li> I have to say, being a guy, I don&#x27;t think about body soap too much.</li>
            <li> I really adore this soap.</li>
            <li> Yardley Lemon Vernena with Sheal Butter bar is a very pleasing scented soap.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like their fragrances as much as Yardley&#x27;s Verbena.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive</li>
            <li> The scent is not over-powering but, in fact, very pleasing.</li>
            <li> , I ended up throwing the whole bar of soap away after one use.</li>
            <li> Our sons, Kai (age 10) and Kou (age 8) are nearly finished watching the third season of [[ASIN</li>
            <li> I still like the other one I had better</li>
            <li> It did keep my skin clean, but it also left a film on my skin that made the water bead every time I used it.</li>
            <li> Nice soap,, I just paid far too much for it here which is why I rated it 3stars,  I actually found it in my local Wegmans for .89cents</li>
            <li> I really like Yardley soaps, and have used them for years, and this new addition is a real winner.</li>
            <li> Pleasant enough as soap goes, but I bought it specifically for the lemon verbena scent, and that is missing.</li>
            <li> I am a new fan of this one!</li>
            <li> Ultimately, we tested the bar in the shower and the whole household had the distinct smell of Lemon Verbena.</li>
            <li> a classic London brand(since 1770)that manufactures high quality items.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this soap since it is being advertised as being made with lemon verbena and shea butter</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> This item is an inexpensive luxury that I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I would much rather use natural soaps made from plant-derived ingredients so I will not be purchasing Yardley again.</li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t seem to dry me out which is a big deal :)</li>
            <li> It has a very nice smell and last about the same as other soaps of similar quality</li>
            <li> what lemon verbena even is, which is evident by the illustration of lemon and a generic purple flower which doesn&#x27;t even look like verbena.  </li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive, so I am cautious about the soap that I use.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your face soft and arrived on time</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses natural soap knows it&#x27;s ....</li>
            <li> Then come to find out that the main ingredient is actually Sodium Tallowate, which is basically animal fat.</li>
            <li> And by the way, most of the big brand name soaps are made from animal fats as the main ingredient, it&#x27;s usually listed as Sodium Tallowate in the ingredients or sometimes simply as just glycerine.</li>
            <li> Fresh and long lasting.</li>
            <li> 1 bar will last probably a month of normal use showering.  </li>
            <li> At about a dollar a bar, the cost is entirely reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes and cleans at least as well as Dove, or any of the major brands - probably better.  </li>
            <li> Read the ingredient list on a bar of Yardley soap and compare it to any major store brand.</li>
            <li> i have since repurchased the item several times for the simple reason that it is slightly cheaper than buying it at a store and it is delivered to your door free and quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> They barely have any aroma whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how large and heavy this soap is.</li>
            <li> It does not dry your skin out like castile soap.</li>
            <li> Does not dry the skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and I have not noticed any build up like other soaps.</li>
            <li> After the shower dont becomes soft or crack(like other</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as other natural soap I&#x27;ve tried at Trader Joe&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was sorry I bought this soap because I was looking for a strong lemon fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this</li>
            <li> Soap was a powder, at least much of it was.  </li>
            <li> I used to use liquid soap all winter long and had problems with cracks at the tips of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I used it for over two months before I discovered how it damaged my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have dry skin to begin with.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had with it that it does run down a bit faster than other soaps.  </li>
            <li> However everything was crushed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not much more expensive than buying &#x27;zest&#x27; or any cheap soap at Walmart.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t get mushy like other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> bar of soap arrived in a small, cardboard box, placed inside a larger box with other orders.</li>
            <li> It is extremely fragrant and not too drying to the skin for body wash.  </li>
            <li> what some other reviewer does..use it in the laundry, or maybe I&#x27;ll just toss it.  </li>
            <li> and I got my other items to boot</li>
            <li> Then I have to look at alternatives again, because the shipping costs online really make the soap too expensive.</li>
            <li> This was the soap that calmed the rash down and made it disappear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bar is big, the soap is firm without being too hard, and it makes a creamy lather without dissolving away.</li>
            <li> I paid less than two bucks for it.</li>
            <li> The Little House on the Prairie]].</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I went through quite a few brands trying to find a soap that would help.  </li>
            <li> but there was very little lemon fragrance.</li>
            <li> But this smells very little like lemon.  </li>
            <li> I could smell it thru the shipping box, tho is it NOT overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad skin rash and the soap I usually used only made things worse.</li>
            <li> the soap itself is unmemorable, and that is not a good thing, will definetly not b buying this again</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but the bars of this soap that I received have absolutely NO lemon smell.</li>
            <li> I actually got this when I had a bad cold.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this smells NOTHING like lemon verbena.  </li>
            <li> sadly it dries out my skin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong for It will be used.  </li>
            <li> But sadly, verbena soap is very expensive :</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this!!! makes skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this soap, but it made my skin so dry. It did keep my skin clean, but it also left a film on my skin that made the water bead every time I used it. I used it for over two months before I discovered how it damaged my already dry skin. I would not purchase this again, but I seem to be in a minority. If it works for you, great. It did not benefit me.</li>
            <li> I had used Yardley of London products growing up, and lemon verbena was one of their best scents, so I thought I would try this soap.  Unfortunately, this smells NOTHING like lemon verbena.  It smells like very cheap dollar store soap.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love all things shea and this one did not disappoint. The smell is fresh and pleasant without being overly anything so I can recommend to my husband who hates floral scents. It leaves my skin soft and I have not noticed any build up like other soaps.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful!  It also suds really well.  I will be buying this again for sure!  I really love that it is a healthier option!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this soap at first but it really grew on me and now I love it. It also doesn&#x27;t get mushy like other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> I have to say, being a guy, I don&#x27;t think about body soap too much. However, when I started to notice that Lever 2000 was drying out my hands, arms and legs, I knew I needed to switch to something else. After finding this Lemon Verbena soap, I&#x27;m hooked. It&#x27;s got a great scent, and funny enough, I&#x27;ve even had a couple girls tell me how great it smells on my skin. That works for me!</li>
            <li> The good news is that Yardley products are paraben-free, SLS-free, and not tested on animals. I had high hopes for this soap since it is being advertised as being made with lemon verbena and shea butter I assumed that it would be a plant-based soap. Then come to find out that the main ingredient is actually Sodium Tallowate, which is basically animal fat. And by the way, most of the big brand name soaps are made from animal fats as the main ingredient, it&#x27;s usually listed as Sodium Tallowate in the ingredients or sometimes simply as just glycerine. I would much rather use natural soaps made from plant-derived ingredients so I will not be purchasing Yardley again. Kirk&#x27;s Castille and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s are good plant-based soaps if you want to try.</li>
            <li> I really adore this soap. For starters, it smells amazing. Lemon verbana has great, cleansing qualities to its scent. I feel detoxified every time I use it in the shower. I actually got this when I had a bad cold. No joke, it felt like the properties of its ingredients \\&quot;lifted\\&quot; my senses and my breathing. The soap lightly moisturizes your skin and leaves you feeling refreshed (not clogged).</li>
            <li> First, I absolutely love verbena.  It is my favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has a light verbena scent infused with lemon/citrus notes.  My skin is fairly sensitive, so I am cautious about the soap that I use.  It didn&#x27;t clog my pores, or irritate my skin.  I found this soap very unique because it lathers very well, washes off clean, and leaves my skin soft and lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love the most is that it moisturizes my skin without leaving it feeling coated in &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love the soap but way too expensive, my local Wegmans has them for ¢89 each.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read somewhere using lemon to wash with will help keep mosquitoes away. I also bought essential oils in lemongrass and citronella and between the two (soap and oil) it has definitely worked! I can&#x27;t say which makes them stay away more but I love the smell of the soap. I&#x27;ll definitely order it again!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts quite some time.  1 bar will last probably a month of normal use showering.  At about a dollar a bar, the cost is entirely reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes and cleans at least as well as Dove, or any of the major brands - probably better.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any unwanted residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one things it leaves behind is a delightful mild lemon verbena scent.  Even at the end of the day, my &#x27;female companion&#x27; notes that my skin smells nice.  I like this soap quite a bit, and will almost certainly buy more of it in the future.  it&#x27;s not much more expensive than buying &#x27;zest&#x27; or any cheap soap at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this natural soap. This soap doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as other natural soap I&#x27;ve tried at Trader Joe&#x27;s but it is definitely a good back up and a great scent. Not to mention this is more easily found in grocery stores and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lathers great. Smells awesome. So fresh and so clean :). I would highly recommend this soap. So glad I opted to buy it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap.  I love the fragrance, the lather, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave me itchy.  This soap is of a superb quality.  It is so dainty, lovely, and beautifully-fragranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This soap is creamy and luxurious. Smells like tea. Love it.</li>
            <li> i bought this for a great price and it was delivered for free. it also arrived very quickly. i have since repurchased the item several times for the simple reason that it is slightly cheaper than buying it at a store and it is delivered to your door free and quickly&lt;br /&gt;i love this soap</li>
            <li> This soap is very rich &amp; creamy. You will feel so refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;The price is just right &amp; wished they sold it in stores in a pack size.</li>
            <li> Always i like the Yardley products(soaps,eau de toilette,talc)because ist a classic London brand(since 1770)that manufactures high quality items.I search for a citrus lemon soap,and buy this.Is a big and solid bar of soap,before use i put this in my room,and the smell of the soap  remained for almost two weeks.After the shower dont becomes soft or crack(like other soaps)Its a quality product but dont have lemon scent only smells verbena,and not what I was looking for.The good thing its only pay $1.00 for each item(I buy 3 soaps)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a fan of Yardley products! When I want a break from lavender, I use the Lemon Verbena. It&#x27;s a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I was sorry I bought this soap because I was looking for a strong lemon fragrance.  I&#x27;m sure the soap itself is very good but there was very little lemon fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fresh and long lasting. A rich lather and beautiful scent</li>
            <li> i love the smell of lemon and the shea butter leaves your skin so soft and refreshed the bar has lasted me for about 3 weeks and still smell so good</li>
            <li> Well, the soap smells nice.  However everything was crushed.  Soap was a powder, at least much of it was.  Leave it USPS.  Cannot use the soap as it is in pieces.  What happened?  Did a truck drive over it?</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent.  The scent last up to the last lather!  and it feels good too.  I recommend that everyone trys this soap.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful. The soap lathers really good. This is good quality soap at a great price. You will love it.</li>
            <li> Smells like perfume, not like lemon verbena.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel special.</li>
            <li> This cleans my skin nicely without leaving a rash or residue. I actually am seeing my skin retain more moisture which is nice. There aren&#x27;t a ton of ingredients in this soap, and it has a lovely gentle scent.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this soap. It does not dry your skin out like castile soap. Scent is very clean smelling. Not to strong. I also have tried the orange spice scent. I like the lemon verbena better.</li>
            <li> Ummmmmmmm, the smell was exquisite from the moment I opened the box!  Yardley has always been a good brand, but I had never purchased any of their soaps before.  I bought this on a whim and am SO happy that I did.  Now I&#x27;m going to buy more!  Not only do I love to use it in the shower, but I want to get some bars as fragrance for my drawers!  This item is an inexpensive luxury that I highly recommend.  After all, don&#x27;t we deserve it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for bathing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, able to get great deal as &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34;.  Now wish had bought more than 1.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the soap. If you have dry skin, i would recommend this product. It leaves your face soft and arrived on time</li>
            <li> I can thank Michael Landon for our purchase of Yardley Lemon Verbena with Shea Butter Bar Soap. Let me explain. Our sons, Kai (age 10) and Kou (age 8) are nearly finished watching the third season of [[ASIN:B0000C2IVT The Little House on the Prairie]]. It is from this TV series that my boys learned how Laura and her sisters adored Lemon Verbena perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scoured Amazon, looking for a relatively inexpensive way to share the scent. Thankfully, this item is available because of the new Add-on program, which allows Amazon to offer thousands of low-priced items that would be cost-prohibitive to ship on their own. These items ship with qualifying orders over $25 and are eligible for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar of soap arrived in a small, cardboard box, placed inside a larger box with other orders. I could smell the soap through two layers of cardboard. Opening the smallest box had the same effect you&#x27;d expect from lighting a scented candle. Now, I&#x27;m not saying it was an offensive smell, but it was strong. Ultimately, we tested the bar in the shower and the whole household had the distinct smell of Lemon Verbena. Its ability to mask a multitude of sins, including irregular bathing, perhaps explains why this particular scent was so popular in the 1800s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Five stars.</li>
            <li> I used to use liquid soap all winter long and had problems with cracks at the tips of my fingers.  No amount of lotion seemed to help.  I started using this soap and liked it so well, I used it to wash my hands too. Surprise!  My fingers no longer crack, even if I forget to put lotion on them.</li>
            <li> I wanted soap that smelled like Verbena without having to pay a million dollars for SOAP - this smells more like lemon - my boyfriend likes it because it&#x27;s kind of a deodorant soap - cheap and smells sorta like it - but not what I expected</li>
            <li> Yardley&#x27;s Lemon Verbena soap is wonderfully scented.  The soap presents a fresh scent that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the consistency of the soap, as it is not one of those soaps requiring drenching before you can lather it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contents are minimal and natural.  It is great for body and face.</li>
            <li> I use it every day. Good price-product deal! Would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this soap.  It is extremely fragrant and not too drying to the skin for body wash.  My husband prefers bar soap and he smells wonderful after a shower using this soap.  Really great.</li>
            <li> I am a verbena soap enthusiest.  After receiving a beautiful bar in a lovely gift box - of another brand - I became a fan!  But sadly, verbena soap is very expensive :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this Yardley brand on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It has a very different lemony scent than the Verbena soap I had purchased before but it isn&#x27;t bad.  I still like the other one I had better but this is fine also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more impressive is how smooth and creamy this soap is.  I am a new fan of this one!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful soap with a great aroma.  I could smell it thru the shipping box, tho is it NOT overwhelming.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> good price, delivered on time but the soap itself is unmemorable, and that is not a good thing, will definetly not b buying this again</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap. You can put in your laundry and it makes the entire room smell fresh and clean. It has lots of lather and I love bathing with. I also love the gentle way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I had a bad skin rash and the soap I usually used only made things worse. I went through quite a few brands trying to find a soap that would help.  This was the soap that calmed the rash down and made it disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Yardley lavender and the oatmeal bar when the store was out of stock, but they did not have the same effect. So, I use this soap exclusively for the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble is the stores I shop in have suddenly discontinued it. I have four bars left. Then I have to look at alternatives again, because the shipping costs online really make the soap too expensive.</li>
            <li> Yardley Lemon Vernena with Sheal Butter bar is a very pleasing scented soap.  Does not dry the skin.  The only problem I had with it that it does run down a bit faster than other soaps.  No matter, I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Based on everyone else if you like a very strong aroma like avon or hose others it might not be your but also some said its too strong. I beilve its mild but its a very earthy mild lemon almost vinalla in my opnion but it is a good smell.</li>
            <li> This Yardley Lemon Verbena soap not only keeps you clean, but it also creates a great lemon scent where ever it is unleashed. Received product in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Have always loved Yardley products. This was not a disappointment and lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and easily breaks out with highly fragranced products.  This smells very nice and I have had no issues with it.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> As soap, this soap is good quality. The bar is big, the soap is firm without being too hard, and it makes a creamy lather without dissolving away. But there is no lemon verbena scent. It just smells like soap. Pleasant enough as soap goes, but I bought it specifically for the lemon verbena scent, and that is missing.</li>
            <li> A good quality soap for dry and sensitive hands. Price was great when I bought it. I paid less than two bucks for it.</li>
            <li> Never knew this existed...verbena is my all time favorite...</li>
            <li> Beautiful light scent. Anyone who uses natural soap knows it&#x27;s .... almost want to say thicker. But it does great, washes squeaky clean and has a lighter scent then expected. Also, doesn&#x27;t seem to dry me out which is a big deal :)</li>
            <li> Nice soap...smells good</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the comparably low price of this soap fool you. It has a wonderful fragrance and it lathers well. The fragrance will linger pleasantly in the bathroom after you shower (it&#x27;s a non-acidic sweet verbena). However, the fragrance will not linger on you! (I consider this a good thing with scented soaps) I&#x27;ve tried the verbena versions of two more expensive brands: Pre de Provence and L&#x27;Occitane. They were good quality soaps too, but quite pricey and I didn&#x27;t like their fragrances as much as Yardley&#x27;s Verbena. Also, this soap is MADE IN USA!</li>
            <li> This soap made a nice little gift accompaniment for a friend.  It has a nice lemony scent she loved and I would consider buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Yardley is a great treat for the body! I love the scent and the feel of the this soap! I encourage people to try it!</li>
            <li> Lemon is  such a clean, zesty smell!  This bar gives you that amazing clean, zesty feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay for citrus cleanliness!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how large and heavy this soap is. If you like a lemon scent, this soap will appeal.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a quality soap. It has a very nice smell and last about the same as other soaps of similar quality</li>
            <li> Yardley has always been a terrific product. love the fragrance and feel of this soap. Was an add on item and love it.</li>
            <li> Nice soap,, I just paid far too much for it here which is why I rated it 3stars,  I actually found it in my local Wegmans for .89cents so I was kinda ticked that paid over $3 for one bar.  Still it&#x27;s a nice soap and I love the lemon scent.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box this item was shipped in it immediately filled the room with an exquisite aroma. I may simply leave these out as potpourri!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always with Yardley, you get natural ingredients that are easy on your skin. Read the ingredient list on a bar of Yardley soap and compare it to any major store brand. You will never get store brand soap again after reading the chemicals you regularly lather your body with.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the pure lemon fragrance like the soap I used to buy from Avon.  But this smells very little like lemon.  I guess that must be what verbena smells like.</li>
            <li> I do love these soaps.  Very inexpensive and they don&#x27;t make me feel like I washed with essence of fiberglass.  :)</li>
            <li> Hoped for more aroma from this product, and I do not like the shape of the bar. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all the rave reviews for this.  Yes, the smell is great, and it lingers on your skin and leaves a nice scent in the bathroom.  But, I found it to be too drying.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I have dry skin to begin with.  I first tried it as a bath soap during the summer...dried out my skin too much.  Then tried using it in winter for hands...dries out my hands.  I&#x27;ll give it one more try on the hands in spring/summer.  If that doesn&#x27;t work, maybe I do what some other reviewer does..use it in the laundry, or maybe I&#x27;ll just toss it.  BTW, I only paid .66 cents a bar on sale at CVS.</li>
            <li> This smells NOTHING like lemon verbena.  This was obviously named by someone who has no idea what lemon verbena even is, which is evident by the illustration of lemon and a generic purple flower which doesn&#x27;t even look like verbena.  Lemon verbena is an herb that smells amazing.  This is just cheap, crappy soap with some lemon scent in it.  Imagine bathing with dishwasher detergent.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for his hand soap every day.  The scent is not over-powering but, in fact, very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Good soap but I just saw this soap at the Dollar Tree...</li>
            <li> I love Yardley&#x27;s all nature products.  They nuture your skin and smell so good! When the product arrrived it was wrapped in an extra layer of plastic, and the fragrance eminated from the package. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use. It did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  I shred the bar with a cheese grater and use it for my home made powdered laundry soap.</li>
            <li> Best soap on the market IMO. Fresh scent with a nice lather, this bar soap that leaves skin feeling clean not dry.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a strong scent which is obviously lemon influenced that fills up the room.  Soap has a luscious feel and lasts well over uses.</li>
            <li> I really like Yardley soaps, and have used them for years, and this new addition is a real winner. Shea butter makes everything better.</li>
            <li> I love the way this soap smells...sadly it dries out my skin so it&#x27;s better for me as a hand soap. The smell is very refreshing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Yarley soap fan.  I especially love the Oatmeal Almond and the Lavender scents  The Lemon Verbena has a medicine -like smell.  I was expecting a strong lemon aroma.  I selected it as an add-on to avoid shipping costs.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong for It will be used.  I thank Amazon for being practical about offering customers low cost functional products to meet the $25 minimum to avoid shipping fees.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but the bars of this soap that I received have absolutely NO lemon smell. They barely have any aroma whatsoever. I might as well use the odorless Neutrogena soap. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I do not like this soap. I do not like strong smells, especially flowery smells, they always make me sneeze and I end up with a stuffy nose.  I bought this soap expecting it to be mild because it is supposed ot be natural. It has a very strong smell not only lemony but very  very flowery also. I was very disappointed with this, I ended up throwing the whole bar of soap away after one use. I was expecting citus.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and lasts long.  I bought this soap to round out a gift card - so it turned out to be a nice filler!</li>
            <li> I needed a fill in for free shipping and this worked.  It is a nice  product with a great smell and I got my other items to boot</li>
