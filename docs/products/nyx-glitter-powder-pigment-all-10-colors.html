            <li>Mac has a good fixer called &amp;#34; fix +&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love these glitters!</li>
            <li>There was a nice mix of colors.  </li>
            <li>They are nice, but I ordered the glitter eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li>It would be great for a fun make-up or for tween/teens to wear.</li>
            <li>The glitter shadow is very smooth.</li>
            <li>They shine beautifully and the colors are vibrant.  </li>
            <li>OMG LOVE IT</li>
            <li>, I LOVE GLITTER</li>
            <li>I love this glitter.</li>
            <li>I wish it was softer on the skin so it would stick to the skin more and show the color more though.</li>
            <li>I love the contents of this product.</li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these glitters.</li>
            <li>I very much so wanted this to be such an awesome product as I give honest reviews, but when I buy something I want what is shown in the picture not something else.</li>
            <li>I thought the glitter would be finer but it was in between chunky and fine.</li>
            <li>I like using ultra fine glitter.</li>
            <li>I was soo excited to get these...</li>
            <li>I love them all the pretty colors</li>
            <li>These are exactly what they appear to be, cute and fun for embellishing eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I use this on top of nail polish or gel to make really sparkly.</li>
            <li>Great price compared to other glitter powder I researched.</li>
            <li>Also, if you read the description, it lists the exact size, so research before you buy!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wear them out, the only is that you have to buy some kind of glitter liner or a cosmetic glitter adhesive in order for them to stick on all day.</li>
            <li>That is worth a rating of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fun way to doll up your face</li>
            <li>The variety is nice but it needs a few more hues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loose, and the colors are very cute.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love these little containers of  glitter.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical because I saw people complaining about the size, but to be honest, they are a nice size.</li>
            <li>If you want the glitter to hold perfectly on your eyes , you gotta use fixer and a thin small brush.</li>
            <li>I will be giving these to my 13 year old niece.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve received light green instead of the baby pink) and the shades of the colors are different in most of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the size of the bottles was a lot smaller than I&#x27;ve expected (a sample size)</li>
            <li>and I  ended up being a hot glittered mess...</li>

            <li> A lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The colors looked amazing and then I tried them on :(  </li>
            <li> I can gently tap the jar to spread the glitter on the skin with little mess or waste.  </li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> the other side, I gave this product a one star because the package was delivered on the planned time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> They go on very nicely with a little base, and they stay on all day and do not crease!</li>
            <li> totally not worth the $24.99 I&#x27;ve paid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not buy not worth the time</li>
            <li> I was missing bout 3 glitters</li>
            <li> Not crunchy or hard.</li>
            <li> was not happy with the misleading size of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, four of the bottles were from other brand (6 of them are from NYX and 4 are from this nameless brand &amp;#34;J.caS&amp;#34;, and I don&#x27;t recommend their eye shadow pigment as it&#x27;s a very bad quality )</li>
            <li> I wanted them to look like the bottle soo bad..</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this</li>
            <li> ughh sucks!!!!!</li>
            <li> I could of got my kids glitter in instead of this crap!!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was soo excited to get these... The colors looked amazing and then I tried them on :(  I wanted them to look like the bottle soo bad.. But it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my eyes and I  ended up being a hot glittered mess... I think u can probably use this as body glitter   but for your eyes nope wont work... I got the pearl shadow as well though and thats stuff  its great... Since the shipping always costs a ton I will have to keep this product... But  I wont be buying the glitter ever again..</li>
            <li> I use this on top of nail polish or gel to make really sparkly. Didn&#x27;t try as eyeshadow. Gold and silver really beautiful</li>
            <li> I love them all the pretty colors yayyy! I can&#x27;t wait to wear them out, the only is that you have to buy some kind of glitter liner or a cosmetic glitter adhesive in order for them to stick on all day.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected.  The directions on the bottle states do not use around your eyes. I would not order again</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product, plus great price!!!!!!! For girls out there that wanna get this product I have a tip. If you want the glitter to hold perfectly on your eyes , you gotta use fixer and a thin small brush. Spray the brush, put some glitter on the brush and apply on your lid. Mac has a good fixer called &amp;#34; fix +&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> OMG LOVE IT, I LOVE GLITTER I HAVE EVERY BOTTLE OF GLITTER MADE AND THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!WILL ORDER AGAIN AND AGAIN</li>
            <li> I very much so wanted this to be such an awesome product as I give honest reviews, but when I buy something I want what is shown in the picture not something else.</li>
            <li> I rated this item with one star because i had some problems with this order.&lt;br /&gt;First, some colors that were displayed on the website are different from the colors I&#x27;ve received. (I&#x27;ve received light green instead of the baby pink) and the shades of the colors are different in most of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the size of the bottles was a lot smaller than I&#x27;ve expected (a sample size) totally not worth the $24.99 I&#x27;ve paid.&lt;br /&gt;Third, four of the bottles were from other brand (6 of them are from NYX and 4 are from this nameless brand &amp;#34;J.caS&amp;#34;, and I don&#x27;t recommend their eye shadow pigment as it&#x27;s a very bad quality ) If I knew this from the start, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. I don&#x27;t like being deceived.&lt;br /&gt;On the other side, I gave this product a one star because the package was delivered on the planned time.</li>
            <li> I thought the glitter would be finer but it was in between chunky and fine. It would be great for a fun make-up or for tween/teens to wear. I like using ultra fine glitter. I will be giving these to my 13 year old niece. It sticks well with the mascara glue that I used. The quality isn&#x27;t bad it&#x27;s just bigger glitter than I like personally.</li>
            <li> I love this glitter. It&#x27;s loose, and the colors are very cute. I wish it was softer on the skin so it would stick to the skin more and show the color more though.</li>
            <li> The glitter powder was just what I was looking for to use in glitter tattoos.  The glitter was well sealed in glass jars.  I can gently tap the jar to spread the glitter on the skin with little mess or waste.  There was a nice mix of colors.  The blue especially stands out.  Great price compared to other glitter powder I researched.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this it was not at all what I wanted. Instead of the actual glitter that is shown in the photo I received so crappy shimmery s***. the set didn&#x27;t even come with the colors that are shown in the photo</li>
            <li> I ordered the 10 glitter eyeshadow &amp; received 10 pearl eyeshadows instead. The bag says glitter eyeshadows, but the pearl eyeshadows are what came in the bag instead of the glitter eyeshadows. They are nice, but I ordered the glitter eyeshadows.  ):</li>
            <li> I love the contents of this product. The glitter shadow is very smooth. Not crunchy or hard. That is worth a rating of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I was not happy with the misleading size of this product. It appeared to be about .45fl oz. Reality is it is .09fl oz. I believed it to be the size of a bottle of finger nail polish. It is closer to the size of the finger nail polish lid. For this reason I gave the overall product a mark of 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Products are the best! Lasted all day. Will order more. A little goes a long ways! Absolutely love these glitters.</li>
            <li> Do not buy not worth the time I could of got my kids glitter in instead of this crap!!!! I was missing bout 3 glitters then it falls all over your face ughh sucks!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these glitters! I was a little skeptical because I saw people complaining about the size, but to be honest, they are a nice size. There is no way to possibly use up all of this glitter! A lot goes a long way. Also, if you read the description, it lists the exact size, so research before you buy! They go on very nicely with a little base, and they stay on all day and do not crease! I would certainly recommend it. Also, I got them before I was even supposed to so that was a nice plus!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what they appear to be, cute and fun for embellishing eyeshadow. Fun way to doll up your face</li>
            <li> I love these little containers of  glitter.  They shine beautifully and the colors are vibrant.  The variety is nice but it needs a few more hues.</li>
