            <li>I love being able to have multiple curled looks and the barrels are really easy to change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ma keep it as simple as possible &amp; just tell you the greatest things about this curling wand.  </li>
            <li>Great product would recommend for other&#x27;s to buy!  </li>
            <li>If you are interested in buying it you should!</li>
            <li>But this was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Also, be very aware of how hot it is.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and they usually do not hold a curl this time it did</li>
            <li>i really like this curling set, and it gets very very hot..</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>Each size gave me different curls or waves and it was quick to do, easy to use.</li>
            <li>so you can see how fast it heats up!  </li>
            <li>As hot as this curling wand heats up, (430 degrees Farenheit)</li>
            <li>I thought, what could be better than 4 different sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li>I used this product about 4 times a week for the first couple months and then about 2 times a week after that.</li>
            <li>Then after two more months another sized head started doing the same thing.</li>
            <li>I love how there are 4 different types of iron sizes to choose from.  </li>
            <li>She is so happy I found this for her and as a professional in the industry I actually use this iron on a daily basis!</li>
            <li>#2- Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I would never spend this much $ on curling irons but</li>
            <li>Believe me girls, it really works.</li>
            <li>I was gentle with this product</li>
            <li>Very unprofessional of this business, they might as well not have a phone line if they are never going to pick it</li>
            <li>Just be cautious with it as it isn&#x27;t very forgiving if you slip and it touches skin.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money so far......</li>
            <li>She has long natural wavy hair and enjoyed it so much that I decided to give it a try myself.  </li>
            <li>Just set it down &amp; go :)  </li>
            <li>The only problem, is that on most hair, I can&#x27;t seem to use the larger barrels.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up, comes with a glove, a convenient storage case (a section for each head) and has a nice long cord.  </li>
            <li>I am very neat and organized and very careful with my expensive products, so I was sure to never drop this and to keep it safe and always let it cool before putting it away, I was gentle with it when changing heads and never changed one when it was hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li>Especially for the price i paid,the product is worth it.</li>
            <li>It would heat up, then cool down and try again every two seconds and not stay hot.</li>
            <li>First off, I received the product several days earlier than the projected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the packaging was not damaged at all, and was in absolute pristine condition.&lt;br /&gt;Third, the product itself works very well!  </li>
            <li>loved the results it would give me--I have very long thick hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased items directly from Folica before and had no problem purchasing this item from them.</li>
            <li>and this is the only curling iron I have found that would get hot enough to curl my hair and have my hair hold the curl.</li>
            <li>I have ordered the 1-1.5 inch first, because I have long hair and like big spirals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to handle, comes with four (4) different sized heads which allows me to choose the exact curl I&#x27;m looking for - whether it be a lose curl for evening or a tight curl for fun, casual days.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair but sometimes just want a different look.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about setting this hot thing on a surface when you put it down.</li>
            <li>I have read only amazing reviews about it, they only bad reviews are from those people who have no idea how to use a clipless curling wand and who give up right away.</li>
            <li>Your hand will get tired but the ending results are worth it!!</li>
            <li>it cools down just as fast</li>
            <li>It was a bit awkward to get used to the wand at first, but once I did, I became a pro and could actually curl my hair very quickly.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As you may already know, ordinary curling irons take forever to cool down \\&quot;/  </li>
            <li> Curling my entire head took only 20 minutes and the curl lasted all day long!</li>
            <li> It takes 15 mins or less to get those soft, glamorous, big curls.  </li>
            <li> However I am looking for a long lasting product and one that reduces frizz, so</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and the curls hold for a long time, even without hair</li>
            <li> I only used it on an average of 1 time per week so after only about 100 uses, it stopped heating fully.</li>
            <li> I always received so many compliments on my hair after using this wand and even recommended this product to others, which I actually feel bad now for doing because of....</li>
            <li> However, the item I was sent was NOT new and was in fact used.</li>
            <li> though I will be buying two Remington curling wands to get the 4 different sizes, I am not worried because the two Remington wands will cost less than the set of Cortex and from other reviews, they seem to last years longer.</li>
            <li> &amp; I was tired of wearing it straight all the time.</li>
            <li> At this point, I&#x27;m not certain</li>
            <li> It was oily and dirty and they made no attempt to even clean it before sending it to me.</li>
            <li> And if your store-bought hair is long &amp; time consuming to do, this literally cuts that time in half!</li>
            <li> One negative is that it did not come with instructions on how to use the different heads that come with it.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, frizzy hair and the curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried traditional curling irons, curling brushes and they are ridiculous to work with</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is the curling iron is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Whatever temperature you heat it up to, the little screen shows you the temperature as it goes up</li>
            <li> It has a little stand built on it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, after just 6 months of using this product, I noticed one of the heads started to have trouble heating up.</li>
            <li> The safety glove hindered my ability to fully grasp pieces of hair, so I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> #4- Curling irons usually require you to use hairspray, etc.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they have both ended up with a severe burn that has left a scar.</li>
            <li> #1- Weaves/wigs/hair extensions are hard to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> Little secret:  </li>
            <li> Shipping was a day late</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> When I look in the hole of the different heads where the base plugs in, I noticed on the two that were not heating up, it looked like the parts inside were breaking.</li>
            <li> SO frustrating!</li>
            <li> ; then I get frizz like crazy regardless).  </li>
            <li> I am throwing this Cortex piece of crap out and buying the Remington wands....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just received my Cortex Curling iron and I was very impressed by how fast the delivery was. The package was in good condition and the iron was working perfectly. I still need some time to get used to it but the results were really nice and it lasted all day. I have fine hair and they usually do not hold a curl this time it did and i did not need any hairspray. Very satisfied with the product and carrier</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, and I love this set of irons. The only problem, is that on most hair, I can&#x27;t seem to use the larger barrels. I have to use the smaller ones, and stretch the curls. Unless I want to set it on 430 degrees, and them hold those barrels on the hair for 30 seconds per curl, essentially burning the hair, I can&#x27;t use them. The rest are wonderful. I would recommend this product, but unless you use lots and LOTS of hair spray, stick to the smaller barrels.</li>
            <li> Especially for the price i paid,the product is worth it. plus it is dual voltage.got a free heat resistant glove ( not a cotton glove)in the package.</li>
            <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;I loved the results it would give me--I have very long thick hair and this is the only curling iron I have found that would get hot enough to curl my hair and have my hair hold the curl. It was a bit awkward to get used to the wand at first, but once I did, I became a pro and could actually curl my hair very quickly. I always received so many compliments on my hair after using this wand and even recommended this product to others, which I actually feel bad now for doing because of....&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;I had this curling iron for about 2 years. I only used it on an average of 1 time per week so after only about 100 uses, it stopped heating fully. It would heat up and then as I was holding a curl in the mirror, I would notice that it would shut itself off. I would have to re heat it and try to curl again for every strand. SO frustrating! I have had a CHI hair straighter that I use 3-4 times/week and I have had it for almost 7 years now and it shows no signs of quitting. Cortex just must not be the same quality of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ma keep it as simple as possible &amp; just tell you the greatest things about this curling wand.  #1- Weaves/wigs/hair extensions are hard to hold a curl. But this does it, believe me. And if your store-bought hair is long &amp; time consuming to do, this literally cuts that time in half! No lie.  #2- Heats up fast. Whatever temperature you heat it up to, the little screen shows you the temperature as it goes up so you can see how fast it heats up!  #3- As hot as this curling wand heats up, (430 degrees Farenheit) it cools down just as fast so u can put it away quicker. As you may already know, ordinary curling irons take forever to cool down \\&quot;/  #4- Curling irons usually require you to use hairspray, etc. to hold the curl. But this curling wand itself does the job PERFECTLY. You can even brush these curls out &amp; it&#x27;ll still hold its shape.  #5- You don&#x27;t have to worry about setting this hot thing on a surface when you put it down. It has a little stand built on it so it doesn&#x27;t touch the surface of wherever you put it. Just set it down &amp; go :)  #6- Already comes with a heat resistent glove so you don&#x27;t have to spend that extra $ to buy one.  I would never spend this much $ on curling irons but my extensions never curled or held a curl &amp; I was tired of wearing it straight all the time. But this was well worth the price. Believe me girls, it really works. I believe it&#x27;s the tools that bring the best results, not the product :)  Shipping was a day late but I don&#x27;t care about that.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling wand set about a year and 3 months ago (April 2011). I thought, what could be better than 4 different sizes to choose from. At first this product was great! Each size gave me different curls or waves and it was quick to do, easy to use. It did leave hair a bit frizzy though, even with protectant and product. The curls and waves would last all day, but they would get frizzier as the day went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here comes the downside. I used this product about 4 times a week for the first couple months and then about 2 times a week after that. I am very neat and organized and very careful with my expensive products, so I was sure to never drop this and to keep it safe and always let it cool before putting it away, I was gentle with it when changing heads and never changed one when it was hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after just 6 months of using this product, I noticed one of the heads started to have trouble heating up. It would heat up, then cool down and try again every two seconds and not stay hot. Then after two more months another sized head started doing the same thing. When I look in the hole of the different heads where the base plugs in, I noticed on the two that were not heating up, it looked like the parts inside were breaking. I was gentle with this product so I wasn&#x27;t sure why it was breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this happened, I thought, no worry it came with a \\&quot;Lifetime Warranty\\&quot; and I had registered it when I got it. I thought, I will just call Cortex International, from the numbers on their website and see if I can&#x27;t use my warrant. Well that was a big JOKE!!! I have been trying to get a hold of them through their customer service and their sales phone lines for about 5 months now...every time I call it goes to a voicemail but won&#x27;t let me leave a message. Very unprofessional of this business, they might as well not have a phone line if they are never going to pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up trying to get my money back on this product. Instead I have decided to purchase the Remington T-Studio Ceramic Pearl Curling Wand. I have read only amazing reviews about it, they only bad reviews are from those people who have no idea how to use a clipless curling wand and who give up right away. I have ordered the 1-1.5 inch first, because I have long hair and like big spirals. It should arrive soon, if I do like it, I will also purchase the .5-1 inch to have the 4 size options that I had before with my Cortex 4 in 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I will be buying two Remington curling wands to get the 4 different sizes, I am not worried because the two Remington wands will cost less than the set of Cortex and from other reviews, they seem to last years longer. I will add a review on the remington wand when I have thoroughly had the chance to use it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a product that works good for 6 months, then buy this Cortex. However I am looking for a long lasting product and one that reduces frizz, so I am throwing this Cortex piece of crap out and buying the Remington wands....hope this review helped!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased items directly from Folica before and had no problem purchasing this item from them. However, the item I was sent was NOT new and was in fact used. It was oily and dirty and they made no attempt to even clean it before sending it to me. I returned it for a refund. At this point, I&#x27;m not certain I would ever buy anything from Folica again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I used it to curl my long hair and my extensions and it works great. The curls last all day. You basically get 4 curling irons in one! You can make your hair wavy or curly. The only negative thing is the curling iron is a little heavy. Your hand will get tired but the ending results are worth it!!</li>
            <li> The best hair styling hair product that I&#x27;ve purchased.  My hair looks like I just stepped out of a salon.  Little secret:  It takes 15 mins or less to get those soft, glamorous, big curls.  I have thick, coarse, frizzy hair and the curls managed to last for 2 - 3 days (unless if there is rain; then I get frizz like crazy regardless).  I love how there are 4 different types of iron sizes to choose from.  The irons are easy to detach and reattach.  The safety glove hindered my ability to fully grasp pieces of hair, so I don&#x27;t use it.  I&#x27;ve gotten burned a couple of times without using the glove, but it&#x27;s like behavioral training:  forces me to be more aware of my actions.</li>
            <li> First off, I received the product several days earlier than the projected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the packaging was not damaged at all, and was in absolute pristine condition.&lt;br /&gt;Third, the product itself works very well!  I have used it several times and the curls hold for a long time, even without hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone.  It is work the extra money to have four barrels.  I love being able to have multiple curled looks and the barrels are really easy to change.</li>
            <li> i love this curling iron, but beware it does get very very hott so i advise anyone who purchases this to wear the glove it come with.</li>
            <li> My daughters are able to make lovely curls with this curler and they love it! Unfortunately, they have both ended up with a severe burn that has left a scar. Just be cautious with it as it isn&#x27;t very forgiving if you slip and it touches skin.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair but sometimes just want a different look.  I purchased this item for myself after purchasing one for my daughter who&#x27;s in college.  She has long natural wavy hair and enjoyed it so much that I decided to give it a try myself.  I&#x27;ve tried traditional curling irons, curling brushes and they are ridiculous to work with and your hair never looks like the pictures or is as easy to use as they make it seem.  The Cortex 4 in One Curling Iron was absolutely perfect for what I was wanting.  It&#x27;s easy to handle, comes with four (4) different sized heads which allows me to choose the exact curl I&#x27;m looking for - whether it be a lose curl for evening or a tight curl for fun, casual days.  It also doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up, comes with a glove, a convenient storage case (a section for each head) and has a nice long cord.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who enjoys changing their hairstyle every now and again.  Once you use it, you&#x27;ll be hooked.  I shop quite a bit on line and this item came within days after ordering.  A great service.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to use. Took me a couple of minutes to get used to it. I have shoulder length, very thick hair. Curling my entire head took only 20 minutes and the curl lasted all day long! Love it.</li>
            <li> i really like this curling set, and it gets very very hot..it curls in seconds!  it took me about 10 minutes to curl all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s waaaay easier to curl your hair with a wand and this wand leaves my hair curled for hours! I&#x27;m in love.mive gotten many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li> I brought this item for my daughter for christmas and she loves it. It is worth the money so far......</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and after 6 months of having this and a lifetime of rolling her hair and having frizzy results she started using this iron and is now a PRO at styling her hair wavy! She loves it and uses it every 2/3 days when she styles her hair! She is so happy I found this for her and as a professional in the industry I actually use this iron on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product would recommend for other&#x27;s to buy!  Very hot, but does the job!  Curls last for days!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  Finally I have curls!  One negative is that it did not come with instructions on how to use the different heads that come with it.  Also, be very aware of how hot it is.  I have burned my wrist and my neck!</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! Best curling iron ever and does exactly what I need it to do VERY pleased! If you are interested in buying it you should!</li>
