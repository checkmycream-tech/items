            <li>Works great laying in bed.</li>
            <li>Great for the price.  </li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>But besides that it works great.</li>
            <li>Great price, great product.</li>
            <li>hot/cold eye pack is good quality, great add on price.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; does NOT stay where it needs to be, and they tear very easily!</li>
            <li>They were just good.</li>
            <li>It seems to be done that way to look good rather than practical use.</li>
            <li>That being said, I still think it was a good purchase and</li>
            <li>It is really good for the puffy eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li>mask was surprisingly comfortable, its great having the eyeholes and the adjustable strap is great</li>
            <li>Also love the velcro, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair!</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with them that I kept them a&amp; now have to buy another set for her basket!</li>
            <li>Liked they don&#x27;t cover eyes</li>
            <li>A hassle to warm up in warm water,</li>
            <li>I was also impressed how much it helped relieve my migraine pain.</li>
            <li>so this was nice to just put in the fridge.</li>
            <li>The adjustable plastic/velcro strap was also nice, so it (a) fits snugly, and (b) doesn&#x27;t dig into your skin or get caught in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the buy 100%!!!</li>
            <li>rubbing an ice cube under your eyes is way more effective.  </li>
            <li>Really very easy to use and much better than a bag of frozen peas.</li>
            <li>very cheap quality.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>However it will get warm very quickly</li>
            <li>I was extremley pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I read the instructions and they say to make sure you put a paper towel or some cloth between your face and the mask so that you do not get frostbite.</li>
            <li>So you have two choices, you can try to cut eye holes in a cloth and wear that under this (although it seems like the cloth would shift and be aggravating in this case) or cover the mask and eyes holes with a cloth (but then you would not be able to see).</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love having the eye holes</li>
            <li>should have had better warning.</li>
            <li>I already have another eye mask that I LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>So I bought this as an add on to an existing Amazon order and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>You kind of have to push them into your eyes if you want them to fit snug.</li>
            <li>So I just sort of flop the straps over the top  of the mask while it&#x27;s on my face</li>
            <li>in any case, while laying prone, the straps will stay out of the way on top of the mask and the mask still conforms to the contour of  face.)</li>
            <li>This product works ok.</li>
            <li>But no, there are still gaps between the top of my eyes and my cheekbones.  </li>
            <li>but you&#x27;d think after attaching this like a vice grip, I would see a better result.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to use something a bit more suited to the purpose though.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Bought them for sinus headaches to mostly wear at night when trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that this mask has eye holes, so you can use it while getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>Love that it has the Velcro strap.</li>
            <li>like.quality is ok.</li>
            <li>No doubt this mask is refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love using it, and can easily velcro it on my head and walk around the house.</li>
            <li>and so glad there was a product like this that was available.</li>
            <li>even so for the price this is a good product and really does help my headaches.</li>
            <li>Easy to wear</li>
            <li>but the maks picks up and holds smells to easily.</li>
            <li>The velcro strap makes it easy to apply and to keep in place, even while sitting up.  </li>
            <li>It can not be microwaved so to warm it up it has to be soaked in hot water for a while before it can be used.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to know that you can&#x27;t microwave this product but have to put it in hot water for 10 minutes instead.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, it has those cool little bead things, great for a migraine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fit is fine for me.</li>
            <li>The ice crystals are great, I just wish it was a little more form fitting.  </li>
            <li>This item is great and for me lasting.</li>
            <li>Has adjustable strap so you can wear it comfortably.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great and convenient product.</li>
            <li>Wipes clean easily, too.</li>
            <li>It may not be that great for people with big heads like mine!</li>
            <li>Cheap and soothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as comfortable as you may think</li>
            <li>I bought these over others because of the price and free shipping.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something quick and easy, if I knew it was non microwaveable</li>
            <li>great for headaches and everyone who tries it buys one.</li>
            <li>Overall good product</li>
            <li>Stick with a cool damp rag and save your money.</li>
            <li>The heat (and cool use) effectiveness lasts about 10-15 minutes and provides a relaxing sense after mask removal.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product and I am very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help with sinus pressure (pregnant and can&#x27;t take decongestants).</li>
            <li>it is very durable too and comfortable on the eyes.</li>
            <li>For the $10 it cost though, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money</li>
            <li>I was certain this bead style was going to fit more closely on my face, especially under my eyes where the real issue is.</li>
            <li>I have not used this mask very much so I cannot comment on how durable it is.</li>
            <li>dont expect to be able to cook or read, it blocks a lot of your vision, but laying down and watching TV is fine.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I was looking for in reducing bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I will likely purchase more of these.</li>
            <li>10 Minutes with this mask and a whole day of head tension ebbs away!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>If I wrote this review after the first time I wore the mask would have been 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>exploded in the microwave first time i used it.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>they really wreak havoc on hair!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have finally found it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>it really does help me a whole lot!</li>
            <li>the price is pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li>My eyes aren&#x27;t deepset in any way nor do I have a large nose.</li>
            <li>We accidentally left it in the freezer once and it thawed out fine.</li>
            <li>It velcros in the back, and seems to stay on fine.</li>
            <li>The little beads provide a nice sense of comfort with their texture.</li>
            <li>The most common problems seem to be the fit, and the durability of the mask.</li>
            <li>and she said it really helped her headache.</li>
            <li>They are very soothing to her.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover as much around the eyes as I would like and seems to have no effect in reducing swelling.</li>
            <li>This item is very soothing to the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Oh, well, he doesn&#x27;t mind the color, and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>- so it is very versatile.  </li>
            <li>The cut out don&#x27;t fit my eyes properly.</li>
            <li>But very soothing otherwise.</li>
            <li>and she love fact that it comes in the color pink.</li>
            <li>I was able to hold the mask down but that caused it to warm up a little faster than it should have.</li>
            <li>might just as well use a warm wash cloth, cheaper and no more hassle.</li>
            <li>then my full facial one.</li>
            <li>Like I said, not a bad product at all, especially for under 2 bucks!</li>
            <li>Definitely more effective than the cold spoon trick.</li>
            <li>The velcro strap is simple, and overall, the mask is pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have high cheek bones and sleep on my stomach/side</li>
            <li>All in all, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Still use sometimes and other than the fit, it is very well made.</li>
            <li>The fit works well, but it doesn&#x27;t stay warm for long enough to do much good for sinus pain :(</li>
            <li>Overall LOVE IT as long as I avoid the Velcro.</li>
            <li>It does not sit right on my face at all, sits above the skin with zero contact.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase to replace the old nonbeaded gel one that had the same problem.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly on my head and stays cold for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>(2) the eye holes are too large such that I didn&#x27;t have any contact with my eye lids - which is where I needed it after eye surgery.</li>
            <li>The mask definitely helped a little bit, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, but don&#x27;t buy this expecting miracles.</li>
            <li>It arrived early  much to my surprise...not only that</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make contact with undereyes near the nose.</li>
            <li>Not heavy weighted on your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, the mask seems to hold together quite well.</li>
            <li>Its larger than it appears and apparently covers your entire upper head, however it doesnt tightly fit over your eye so dont buy if you want to use it for the area beneath your eyes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hit the areas right around the eyes, as other reviewers noted, but still works well and the beads really hold the temp for a long time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was expected</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I put it on was that my nose kept it from laying flat against the inner corners of my under eyes, where I have puffiness.</li>
            <li>I bought a TheraPearl one at the same time, and that one has proved to be much hardier, though it doesn&#x27;t have the features mentioned above.</li>
            <li>If you want good contact around your eyes, you have to use your hands, which is inconvenient.  </li>
            <li>this product is good to be used as a cold pack.</li>
            <li>I get migraines and need pressure on my face and usually I get a cool rag</li>
            <li>am planning on buying another in the near future and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>The mask itself doesn&#x27;t leak, but with so many beads broken open inside, it no longer molds to your face, which defeats the purpose of getting the one with the pearl beads.</li>
            <li>Some other reviewers didn&#x27;t like the holes in the mask being bigger, but I really prefer it.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is pretty stiff, so it can leave lines where it presses against the bridge of your nose.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t help a whole lot with pressure, it helps a little.</li>

            <li> Cheap and soothing.</li>

            <li> I was looking for something to help with sinus pressure (pregnant and can&#x27;t take decongestants).</li>
            <li> it is very durable too and comfortable on the eyes.</li>

            <li> It did exactly what I was looking for in reducing bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I will likely purchase more of these.</li>
            <li> 10 Minutes with this mask and a whole day of head tension ebbs away!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> If I wrote this review after the first time I wore the mask would have been 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> exploded in the microwave first time i used it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> they really wreak havoc on hair!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have finally found it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> it really does help me a whole lot!</li>
            <li> the price is pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> My eyes aren&#x27;t deepset in any way nor do I have a large nose.</li>
            <li> We accidentally left it in the freezer once and it thawed out fine.</li>
            <li> It velcros in the back, and seems to stay on fine.</li>
            <li> The little beads provide a nice sense of comfort with their texture.</li>
            <li> The most common problems seem to be the fit, and the durability of the mask.</li>
            <li> and she said it really helped her headache.</li>
            <li> They are very soothing to her.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover as much around the eyes as I would like and seems to have no effect in reducing swelling.</li>
            <li> This item is very soothing to the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Oh, well, he doesn&#x27;t mind the color, and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> - so it is very versatile.  </li>
            <li> The cut out don&#x27;t fit my eyes properly.</li>
            <li> But very soothing otherwise.</li>
            <li> and she love fact that it comes in the color pink.</li>
            <li> I was able to hold the mask down but that caused it to warm up a little faster than it should have.</li>
            <li> might just as well use a warm wash cloth, cheaper and no more hassle.</li>
            <li> then my full facial one.</li>
            <li> Like I said, not a bad product at all, especially for under 2 bucks!</li>
            <li> Definitely more effective than the cold spoon trick.</li>
            <li> The velcro strap is simple, and overall, the mask is pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have high cheek bones and sleep on my stomach/side</li>
            <li> All in all, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Still use sometimes and other than the fit, it is very well made.</li>
            <li> The fit works well, but it doesn&#x27;t stay warm for long enough to do much good for sinus pain :(</li>
            <li> Overall LOVE IT as long as I avoid the Velcro.</li>
            <li> It does not sit right on my face at all, sits above the skin with zero contact.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase to replace the old nonbeaded gel one that had the same problem.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly on my head and stays cold for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> (2) the eye holes are too large such that I didn&#x27;t have any contact with my eye lids - which is where I needed it after eye surgery.</li>
            <li> The mask definitely helped a little bit, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, but don&#x27;t buy this expecting miracles.</li>
            <li> It arrived early  much to my surprise...not only that</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make contact with undereyes near the nose.</li>
            <li> Not heavy weighted on your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, the mask seems to hold together quite well.</li>
            <li> Its larger than it appears and apparently covers your entire upper head, however it doesnt tightly fit over your eye so dont buy if you want to use it for the area beneath your eyes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hit the areas right around the eyes, as other reviewers noted, but still works well and the beads really hold the temp for a long time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I put it on was that my nose kept it from laying flat against the inner corners of my under eyes, where I have puffiness.</li>
            <li> I bought a TheraPearl one at the same time, and that one has proved to be much hardier, though it doesn&#x27;t have the features mentioned above.</li>
            <li> If you want good contact around your eyes, you have to use your hands, which is inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> this product is good to be used as a cold pack.</li>
            <li> I get migraines and need pressure on my face and usually I get a cool rag</li>
            <li> am planning on buying another in the near future and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The mask itself doesn&#x27;t leak, but with so many beads broken open inside, it no longer molds to your face, which defeats the purpose of getting the one with the pearl beads.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers didn&#x27;t like the holes in the mask being bigger, but I really prefer it.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is pretty stiff, so it can leave lines where it presses against the bridge of your nose.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t help a whole lot with pressure, it helps a little.</li>
            <li> I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.</li>
            <li> so I always suggest getting two and switting them while leaving the other one near on ice.</li>
            <li> It last as long as a cold/hot towel would last.</li>
            <li> THAT long, which is the only reason they don&#x27;t get 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Also, the beads do not fill the mask completely, so they shift up and down or side to side while wearing it</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the micro beads can be shifted around so that one can have more cold where you want it.  </li>
            <li> The cold rests on my upper and lower lids, so the cold goes where it needs to go... very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t fit well or seem to work for eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and thus my hair kept getting stuck to the Velcro one way or another no matter WHAT.</li>
            <li> However, I did have two minor issues with this mask</li>
            <li> I put it on my fridge for a couple of hours and relax with this after a long stressful day</li>
            <li> Adjustable band at back of head or just lay on eyes if laying down flat in bed.</li>
            <li> The only part that does make contact is the bridge across the nose., and that part has a sharp plastic edge that digs into my skin.</li>
            <li> It stayed really cold for 15 - 20 minutes (following the directions on the package to cool it).  </li>
            <li> Little big, but does the job I guess...</li>
            <li> unless you have a tiny head and your eyes are very close together, this is useless.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is that there doesnt seem to be enough beads</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the beads seem to be getting smaller over time.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> And when the Velcro straps are wet-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also came days before it&#x27;s expected date.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mask for a man, and it came in pink.</li>
            <li> An alternative would be for sinus relief since they are wide.</li>
            <li> I received pink.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the next morning I had a super-hero shaped puffy red skin mask on my face.</li>
            <li> OK, now the negative part, the mask doesn&#x27;t stay cold for very long, I&#x27;d say 15min max.  </li>
            <li> Hot and cold doesn&#x27;t last 10 min longer than others.  </li>
            <li> The mask stays cold for quite a while if you cool it for the recommended time.</li>
            <li> I like cold compresses tight against my head and this is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how tight or loose I make the Velcro around my head, it still gaps.  </li>
            <li> I managed to get this at a mere $1.61 + tax, so I can&#x27;t complain too much about this product.  </li>
            <li> However, the curvature of the nose area is not correct and for this reason the mask does not touch the part just under the eyes, where the dark circles occur.</li>
            <li> Need the puffiness to go down there too.</li>
            <li> But putting it on right out of the freezer is too cold, so I recommend taking it out and keeping in room temp for one minute it or so.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price...and not worth the trouble of returning.</li>
            <li> Got this for when we get really bad headaches as holding a cool washcloth is a pain.</li>
            <li> In the morning if my face is a little puffy I&#x27;ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I was a little worried.</li>
            <li> Plus the nose part scratches me a little.</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid condition which affects my eyes(swelling, irritated, tired) and this definitely helps soothe them and me!</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got it in that sea-foam green color, which i was hoping i would get since colors vary.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks, keep it in the fridge when not in use, and use it 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> So the whole purpose of this mask is defeated due to bad design.</li>
            <li> I bought these eye mask for long days at work where my eyes are tired, but defeat the purpose.</li>
            <li> Way too cold to put directly on eyes and by the time you can it is melted</li>
            <li> Waste of money! ....</li>
            <li> (1) when warmed the beads tend to &#x27;disperse&#x27; unevenly inside the mask so you have some gaps where there are no warm beads and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten around 30-40 minutes of use before I take it off, and it is usually still cold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard Plastic</li>
            <li> Not smelly- no plastic icky smell.</li>
            <li> This should read as common sense, but just putting it out there-</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get cold enough or stayed cold enough and it fits improperly and leaves marks on your face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay cold very long.</li>
            <li> I kept it in a ziplock bag in my fridge and the second time I took it out to use it smelt too bad to have on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly keeping it in an airtight container could</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t put it in the freezer, it will cause some of the little balls to tear and it will be way too cold to put on your face.  </li>
            <li> and it soothes tired baggy eyes...</li>
            <li> when i get a really nasty headache i need dark quiet no movement and cold on my head....</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed at the gel eye mask.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable to wear unless you put a cloth between you and the plastic.  </li>
            <li> I received mine damaged so the weird filling oozed out.</li>
            <li> Have not used it for heat yet am uncomfortable about putting in microwave</li>
            <li> I would leave it in the fridge because the freezer makes it too cold and unable to use</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay cold</li>
            <li> They stay cold for all of five minutes.</li>
            <li> Stays on well and is flexible even when cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had puffy eyes all my life and tried every method from cold spoons to tea bags for my puffy under eyes.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my car in the cold months and put it on when Im driving to work so that my eyes are not so puffy when I get there</li>
            <li> and so Cold</li>
            <li> so i can get the cold all around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the freezer it stays cold longer then</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from periodic migraine headaches and this gel mask, when chilled in the freezer, provides some relief for her as part of her migraine therapy.</li>
            <li> This is not at all an issue, because the cold still invades your eye sockets and clears up all of my eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I used the mask - cold - on my eyes and forehead after surgery.  </li>
            <li> did not work as well as the cold, although I followed directions on package.  </li>
            <li> VERY Uncomfortable...........</li>
            <li> I had read one of the bad reviews but decided to give it a chance anyway.</li>
            <li> I was having a bad time of it with allergies</li>
            <li> Do not put in microwave :(.</li>
            <li> this was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Indifferent. Liked that they are cold. Liked they don&#x27;t cover eyes so I can read or watch TV while wearing them. However I now realized I should have purchased entire eye covering w/o eye openings.</li>
            <li> I managed to get this at a mere $1.61 + tax, so I can&#x27;t complain too much about this product.  I like the fact that the micro beads can be shifted around so that one can have more cold where you want it.  It fits well on my head with a velcro strap in the back that you can adjust to your size.  OK, now the negative part, the mask doesn&#x27;t stay cold for very long, I&#x27;d say 15min max.  But putting it on right out of the freezer is too cold, so I recommend taking it out and keeping in room temp for one minute it or so.  I have a thyroid condition which affects my eyes(swelling, irritated, tired) and this definitely helps soothe them and me! Like I said, not a bad product at all, especially for under 2 bucks!</li>
            <li> I was extremley pleased with this product. It did exactly what I was looking for in reducing bags under the eyes. Easy to wear and so glad there was a product like this that was available. The quality of the product verses cost was the best!&lt;br /&gt;Dianne</li>
            <li> The fit works well, but it doesn&#x27;t stay warm for long enough to do much good for sinus pain :(</li>
            <li> Mask was perfect!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it has those cool little bead things, great for a migraine. i would recommend it</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers didn&#x27;t like the holes in the mask being bigger, but I really prefer it.  I can wear the mask and still function.  The cold rests on my upper and lower lids, so the cold goes where it needs to go... very happy with the product.  Also love the velcro, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair!</li>
            <li> This is perfect and the price was in the range I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It was for my daughter and she said it really helped her headache.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make contact with undereyes near the nose. Need the puffiness to go down there too.</li>
            <li> I brought these for my mother after she had laser eye surgery. They are very soothing to her.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Uncomfortable to wear unless you put a cloth between you and the plastic.  A hassle to warm up in warm water, might just as well use a warm wash cloth, cheaper and no more hassle.</li>
            <li> This item is great and for me lasting. However it will get warm very quickly so I always suggest getting two and switting them while leaving the other one near on ice. Overall good product</li>
            <li> I have not used this mask very much so I cannot comment on how durable it is. The reason I bought this mask is because it has eye holes. I wanted a mask that would allow me to look around and read or watch television while I was wearing it. When it arrived I read the instructions and they say to make sure you put a paper towel or some cloth between your face and the mask so that you do not get frostbite. It does not say this on the online description of the product and I think that it should. So you have two choices, you can try to cut eye holes in a cloth and wear that under this (although it seems like the cloth would shift and be aggravating in this case) or cover the mask and eyes holes with a cloth (but then you would not be able to see). Also, the beads do not fill the mask completely, so they shift up and down or side to side while wearing it and then only one part of your face gets the coldness or hotness from them. Basically, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The ice crystals are great, I just wish it was a little more form fitting.  If you want good contact around your eyes, you have to use your hands, which is inconvenient.  Still use sometimes and other than the fit, it is very well made.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a gift basket for a class mate that will graduate with me. I was so pleased with them that I kept them a&amp; now have to buy another set for her basket!</li>
            <li> hot/cold eye pack is good quality, great add on price. Not smelly- no plastic icky smell. Has adjustable strap so you can wear it comfortably.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different gel masks, not so much for puffiness or anything like that, but because I suffer from migraines.  I like cold compresses tight against my head and this is fantastic.  Now I can have it soothing my head and still see where I&#x27;m going ;) I will likely purchase more of these.</li>
            <li> 10 Minutes with this mask and a whole day of head tension ebbs away!</li>
            <li> Got this for when we get really bad headaches as holding a cool washcloth is a pain. Works exactly as stated. We accidentally left it in the freezer once and it thawed out fine. No leaks or issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am planning on buying another in the near future and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this.I use it every night ...Great for headaches and it soothes tired baggy eyes... Worth the buy 100%!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
            <li> this product is good to be used as a cold pack. It can not be microwaved so to warm it up it has to be soaked in hot water for a while before it can be used.</li>
            <li> Very simple, yet essential accessory for some mornings.  They don&#x27;t stay cold THAT long, which is the only reason they don&#x27;t get 5 stars.  I love having the eye holes so you can still do things while they are decompressing and cooling your temples and eyes.  Great product.</li>
            <li> No choice in color, but I like it. The girls in my dorm and I use it on spa night.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover as much around the eyes as I would like and seems to have no effect in reducing swelling.</li>
            <li> Its larger than it appears and apparently covers your entire upper head, however it doesnt tightly fit over your eye so dont buy if you want to use it for the area beneath your eyes.</li>
            <li> In the morning if my face is a little puffy I&#x27;ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.</li>
            <li> It arrived early  much to my surprise...not only that but this mask actually helps me with my headaches.....when i get a really nasty headache i need dark quiet no movement and cold on my head....this mask is perfect and does the trick! i am soooooo very glad that i made this purchase! it really does help me a whole lot!</li>
            <li> If I wrote this review after the first time I wore the mask would have been 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;This mask was surprisingly comfortable, its great having the eyeholes and the adjustable strap is great but the maks picks up and holds smells to easily. I kept it in a ziplock bag in my fridge and the second time I took it out to use it smelt too bad to have on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly keeping it in an airtight container could help.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, if I make a purchase big enough for add ons, I would buy this again and try out having it in a container.</li>
            <li> This product has helped with my migraine pain.</li>
            <li> Do not put in microwave :(. It explodes.</li>
            <li> I received mine damaged so the weird filling oozed out. I&#x27;d return it, but then I&#x27;d get charged for shipping which I shouldn&#x27;t have to pay for, especially when it&#x27;s not my fault.</li>
            <li> great for headaches and everyone who tries it buys one. I would leave it in the fridge because the freezer makes it too cold and unable to use</li>
            <li> this was terrible. exploded in the microwave first time i used it. within 30 seconds. should have had better warning.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with under eye swelling.  I already have another eye mask that I LOVE LOVE LOVE but it doesn&#x27;t have the eye holes so you have to stop everything to use it.  So I bought this as an add on to an existing Amazon order and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I can wear it while I&#x27;m getting my day started or while working on my computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t put it in the freezer, it will cause some of the little balls to tear and it will be way too cold to put on your face.  I made that mistake once.  I keep it in the fridge and slap it on whenever I feel the urge. Overall it is a great and convenient product.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed at the gel eye mask.  I purchased it for puffiness in the eye area but it didn&#x27;t work as I expected it to.  I ended up purchasing an eye gel.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need. Works great laying in bed. Glad to have finally found it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They were just good. Got what I ordered</li>
            <li> I wish these laid on your face tighter. You kind of have to push them into your eyes if you want them to fit snug. Then again, my face probably isn&#x27;t the same size as everyone else&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> I had read one of the bad reviews but decided to give it a chance anyway. However, the curvature of the nose area is not correct and for this reason the mask does not touch the part just under the eyes, where the dark circles occur. So the whole purpose of this mask is defeated due to bad design.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t reach the areas that are actually puffy. Whats the point if I have to press it to my face?</li>
            <li> No good. It does not sit right on my face at all, sits above the skin with zero contact. The only part that does make contact is the bridge across the nose., and that part has a sharp plastic edge that digs into my skin. Stick with a cool damp rag and save your money.</li>
            <li> I was having a bad time of it with allergies and I thought this would head my stingy eyes and sore head, and it did for a minute, but then it started leaking. I had to throw it in the bin. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great for the price.  The plastic is pretty stiff, so it can leave lines where it presses against the bridge of your nose.</li>
            <li> They stay cold for all of five minutes. The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; does NOT stay where it needs to be, and they tear very easily! I would never recommend them or buy them again!!</li>
            <li> Purchased for use after eye operation.  Really very easy to use and much better than a bag of frozen peas.</li>
            <li> Soothing. Not heavy weighted on your face. Wipes clean easily, too. The Velcro straps are a nuisance in my opinion- I have long hair and thus my hair kept getting stuck to the Velcro one way or another no matter WHAT. And when the Velcro straps are wet- they really wreak havoc on hair! So I just sort of flop the straps over the top  of the mask while it&#x27;s on my face and they stay out of my way. (If you lay on your side, the mask itself is not going to stay in place. This should read as common sense, but just putting it out there- in any case, while laying prone, the straps will stay out of the way on top of the mask and the mask still conforms to the contour of  face.) The heat (and cool use) effectiveness lasts about 10-15 minutes and provides a relaxing sense after mask removal. The little beads provide a nice sense of comfort with their texture. Overall LOVE IT as long as I avoid the Velcro.</li>
            <li> Stays on well and is flexible even when cold.</li>
            <li> This eye mask helps to reduce puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I was a little worried. But when it came I was very impressed! It fits perfectly on my head and stays cold for long periods of time. I was also impressed how much it helped relieve my migraine pain. Overall, a great product and I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came days before it&#x27;s expected date.</li>
            <li> very cheap quality.  Way too cold to put directly on eyes and by the time you can it is melted</li>
            <li> I paid $12 bucks for one ea here at Amazon.  It doesn&#x27;t cover my eye lids (uper and lower where the puffiness is), it covers eye brows and my cheeks which has no use for it. The eye opening is too big.  It seems to be done that way to look good rather than practical use. Hot and cold doesn&#x27;t last 10 min longer than others.  It last as long as a cold/hot towel would last.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with sinus pressure (pregnant and can&#x27;t take decongestants). It would have been nice to know that you can&#x27;t microwave this product but have to put it in hot water for 10 minutes instead. I was looking for something quick and easy, if I knew it was non microwaveable I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it</li>
            <li> This item is very soothing to the eyes.  it is very durable too and comfortable on the eyes. great product</li>
            <li> The only drawback with this mask is that I do wish that you could select a color. I ordered this mask for a man, and it came in pink. Oh, well, he doesn&#x27;t mind the color, and he really likes it. It doesn&#x27;t hit the areas right around the eyes, as other reviewers noted, but still works well and the beads really hold the temp for a long time. I&#x27;d buy this product again. It&#x27;s a great value for the price!</li>
            <li> This product works ok. I get migraines and need pressure on my face and usually I get a cool rag so this was nice to just put in the fridge. The beads move around a lot so I&#x27;m constantly having to realign them. And it doesn&#x27;t help a whole lot with pressure, it helps a little.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price...and not worth the trouble of returning. I will donate mine to goodwill and hope someone else can make use of it.</li>
            <li> I was certain this bead style was going to fit more closely on my face, especially under my eyes where the real issue is. But no, there are still gaps between the top of my eyes and my cheekbones.  My eyes aren&#x27;t deepset in any way nor do I have a large nose. I have a smaller head but you&#x27;d think after attaching this like a vice grip, I would see a better result.  Nope.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how tight or loose I make the Velcro around my head, it still gaps.  I&#x27;ve resorted to putting cucumbers on my eyes and then adding this for extra measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase to replace the old nonbeaded gel one that had the same problem.</li>
            <li> These are at the Dollar Tree for a dollar. Bought one and the next day found it at the store. But besides that it works great.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t fit well or seem to work for eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat puffiness under my eyes. The first thing I noticed when I put it on was that my nose kept it from laying flat against the inner corners of my under eyes, where I have puffiness. I was able to hold the mask down but that caused it to warm up a little faster than it should have. The mask definitely helped a little bit, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, but don&#x27;t buy this expecting miracles. For the $10 it cost though, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it. Definitely more effective than the cold spoon trick.</li>
            <li> I got it in that sea-foam green color, which i was hoping i would get since colors vary. I just put it in the fridge before bed, wake up, take a shower, tie it on, and relax for about 10 or 20 minutes. In that time, i can apply lotion, brush my teeth, and pick out my clothes for the day. It may not be that great for people with big heads like mine! The Velcro tie in the back gets caught in my hair also. Plus the nose part scratches me a little. But, it&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t put up with. I&#x27;ve had puffy eyes all my life and tried every method from cold spoons to tea bags for my puffy under eyes. I wanted to use something a bit more suited to the purpose though. :) Reduces puffiness like a charm! Recommend to all my fellow puffy eye sufferers!</li>
            <li> Cheap and soothing. I just leave it in the fridge and pull it out when needed. It velcros in the back, and seems to stay on fine.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my car in the cold months and put it on when Im driving to work so that my eyes are not so puffy when I get there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as comfortable as you may think</li>
            <li> I bought this for puffiness under the eyes......Waste of money! ....Hard Plastic and so Cold it burns. VERY Uncomfortable........... I threw it out!</li>
            <li> Function just like you would think from the picture. Bought them for sinus headaches to mostly wear at night when trying to sleep. I bought these over others because of the price and free shipping. If I had to do again would get a mask that covers the eyes for added cooling relief.</li>
            <li> Little big, but does the job I guess... I have high cheek bones and sleep on my stomach/side so I wake up with puffy eyes, this seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the next morning I had a super-hero shaped puffy red skin mask on my face. It didn&#x27;t seem like the gel was leaking when I used it, but it was def. toxic. Had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> awesome - great price</li>
            <li> who&#x27;s face was this made for?  unless you have a tiny head and your eyes are very close together, this is useless.  it does not even touch below your eyes.  rubbing an ice cube under your eyes is way more effective.  and if you put in fridge, it will absorb all the food smells....ick</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.  I like the fact that this can be warmed, cooled and frozen - so it is very versatile.  The velcro strap makes it easy to apply and to keep in place, even while sitting up.  However, I did have two minor issues with this mask (1) when warmed the beads tend to &#x27;disperse&#x27; unevenly inside the mask so you have some gaps where there are no warm beads and (2) the eye holes are too large such that I didn&#x27;t have any contact with my eye lids - which is where I needed it after eye surgery. That being said, I still think it was a good purchase and something I will use quite often.</li>
            <li> Relieves my migraines...</li>
            <li> this is wonderful for migraine or sinus pressure days. my only complaint is that there doesnt seem to be enough beads so i have to try and spread them out so i can get the cold all around my eyes. even so for the price this is a good product and really does help my headaches. dont expect to be able to cook or read, it blocks a lot of your vision, but laying down and watching TV is fine.</li>
            <li> Pros: It&#x27;s great that this mask has eye holes, so you can use it while getting ready in the morning. The adjustable plastic/velcro strap was also nice, so it (a) fits snugly, and (b) doesn&#x27;t dig into your skin or get caught in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The gel doesn&#x27;t get cold enough in the fridge to be effective, so you have to use the freezer. This worked really well for a few weeks, but then the beads started to burst after being in the freezer for only an hour or so. The mask itself doesn&#x27;t leak, but with so many beads broken open inside, it no longer molds to your face, which defeats the purpose of getting the one with the pearl beads. I bought a TheraPearl one at the same time, and that one has proved to be much hardier, though it doesn&#x27;t have the features mentioned above.</li>
            <li> The eye masks are not sized correctly. The cut out don&#x27;t fit my eyes properly. I bought these eye mask for long days at work where my eyes are tired, but defeat the purpose. An alternative would be for sinus relief since they are wide.</li>
            <li> She believes it is the greatest idea out there.  She claims it helps with her sore eyes, stress and tension.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the freezer it stays cold longer then then my full facial one. It is really good for the puffy eyes in the morning. Have not used it for heat yet am uncomfortable about putting in microwave</li>
            <li> Great price, great product. Wish I could&#x27;ve chosen the color. Maybe I could have, but missed it. I received pink.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay cold very long. Also, seam that bends around bridge of nose sometimes leaves a mark. But very soothing otherwise. Love that it has the Velcro strap.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from periodic migraine headaches and this gel mask, when chilled in the freezer, provides some relief for her as part of her migraine therapy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get cold enough or stayed cold enough and it fits improperly and leaves marks on your face. It didn&#x27;t reach the part of my eye that I wanted to depuff</li>
            <li> I like the eye masks but the picture is not what the mask actually looks like.quality is ok.Its worth the money</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this product. she says  it help her not to to have have bag  under her eyes and she love fact that it comes in the color pink. the price is pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked at a lot of eye masks on amazon, and despite how similar the masks seem, the reviews seem mixed. The most common problems seem to be the fit, and the durability of the mask. As of now (4 days of owning the product) the mask has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask needs to be in the freezer for 30 minutes, or in the fridge for 1 hour before use. The mask stays cold for quite a while if you cool it for the recommended time. I&#x27;ve gotten around 30-40 minutes of use before I take it off, and it is usually still cold.&lt;br /&gt;So far, the mask seems to hold together quite well. I don&#x27;t expect to have any problems with it. IF it happens to break, I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fit is fine for me. As one reviewer stated, it touches the cheeks and eyebrows. This is not at all an issue, because the cold still invades your eye sockets and clears up all of my eye puffiness. The velcro strap is simple, and overall, the mask is pretty comfortable. I will definitely purchase another one if the need arises</li>
            <li> No doubt this mask is refreshing. I love using it, and can easily velcro it on my head and walk around the house. The only complaint I have is that the beads seem to be getting smaller over time. I have been using it for a few weeks, keep it in the fridge when not in use, and use it 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> I used the mask - cold - on my eyes and forehead after surgery.  It stayed really cold for 15 - 20 minutes (following the directions on the package to cool it).  Very comfortable. Adjustable band at back of head or just lay on eyes if laying down flat in bed. I also used it while sitting in a chair watching tv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat did not work as well as the cold, although I followed directions on package.  All in all, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I haven&#x27;t used it for heat yet. I just wish it stayed frozen all night</li>
            <li> I put it on my fridge for a couple of hours and relax with this after a long stressful day</li>
