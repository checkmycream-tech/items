            <li>Perfect for the, ahem, mature</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just really happy to have found a large sized bottle of this.</li>
            <li>and I love how my face looks after I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for many years.</li>
            <li>I love neostrata products.</li>
            <li>, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it and this one is working, so I do recommend it :-)</li>
            <li>Non-drying, great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is the polyhydroxide in it that makes it great for my sensitive skin as opposed to alphahydroxy or salisilic acid.  </li>
            <li>Buying this online is much more economical!</li>
            <li>and it feels just fine to me.    </li>
            <li>This is a great facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels baby smooth after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>My face looks clean and smooth after each wash.</li>
            <li>Wake up in the morning, clean my face with this</li>
            <li>Been suffering with acne and really dry skin for a couple of years and this cleanser is by far the best product I ever used on my face.</li>
            <li>It is a good cleanser and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>okay busy all the times...</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>GREAT product for oily skin; not at all for dry, sensitive, hormonal skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got my first bottle from my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and clean without over-drying it.</li>
            <li>Not only does this cleanser do a great job without stripping your skin of essential oils, but the dispenser lets you use the very last drop.</li>
            <li>The facial cleanser is soap and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>Do not need to use much so it lasts a while for each bottle.</li>
            <li>I love it not only for its general use as described but for how well it also removes my makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers are right when they say that there&#x27;s not much of a later at all, honestly, but I just keep adding a little more water when I feel it start drying out</li>
            <li>Non irritating, fragrance free and satisfying results.</li>
            <li>It is FAST on and FAST off for those busy,</li>
            <li>This was prescribed by my dermatologist and I used to purchase from her, but the price was so high.  </li>
            <li>Then I put on high potency cream.  </li>
            <li>The high potency cream by Neostrsta</li>
            <li>like I was in high school all over again.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it and most definitely recommend this facial cleanser to anybody; especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately did not work for me, as my skin was already sensitive and it only dried it out more, created more oil, more bacteria, and prolonged my skin&#x27;s &amp;#34;hot-mess&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>At first it felt like the same product..</li>
            <li>but I still continue to pay for it since it keeps my skin so clear without drying it out.</li>
            <li>It is to gentle and does not cleanse well enough.</li>
            <li>so far</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my derma because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These products are more expensive than drug store brands, but are well worth it.</li>
            <li>use it twice daily, and it makes the skin feel smooth and a bit tight.  </li>
            <li>No other site seems to have this.</li>
            <li>but a week later it was clear...</li>
            <li>Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve occasionally tried other gentle cleansers from the drug stores</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This project works well with my rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are more expensive than drug store brands, but are well worth it.</li>
            <li> Slimy and doesn&#x27;t remove makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I resort to using in the morning and it messes with my makeup longevity. Cannot win with this cleanser that doesn&#x27;t cleanse anything. I would buy MD Forte cleanser over this one for AHA if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for in a cleanser. For me this goes in the why bother category.</li>
            <li> I was just given a few samples of this by my dermatologist and I love how my face looks after I use it. I only use a pea-sized amount (a pea &amp; a half is my limit tho). Other reviewers are right when they say that there&#x27;s not much of a later at all, honestly, but I just keep adding a little more water when I feel it start drying out and it feels just fine to me.    I&#x27;ve only been using this since the beginning of 2011 but I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;ll only keep working. My face looks clean and smooth after each wash. I&#x27;m just really happy to have found a large sized bottle of this. No other site seems to have this.</li>
            <li> Great product. The design of the bottle has changed but the product is still the same. I&#x27;ve been using this for many years.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist in Feburary 2014. I love it not only for its general use as described but for how well it also removes my makeup at the end of the day. Makes my face feel fully cleansed, plus only a small amount -a single push is required which makes the product last longer. Use it twice a day- morning and before bedtime. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Good value.</li>
            <li> Not only does this cleanser do a great job without stripping your skin of essential oils, but the dispenser lets you use the very last drop.</li>
            <li> I did not like this face wash at all. It did not help with my acne. It is to gentle and does not cleanse well enough. This face wash does not suds and is just a gel. I wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> Also recommended by my dermatologist, I use this along with the Neo Strata Bionic Lotion. Non irritating, fragrance free and satisfying results.</li>
            <li> I love neostrata products. The facial cleanser is soap and fragrance free. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Ordered this antibacterial cleanser in an attempt to control my hormonal acne. Read wonderful reviews about the product. Unfortunately did not work for me, as my skin was already sensitive and it only dried it out more, created more oil, more bacteria, and prolonged my skin&#x27;s &amp;#34;hot-mess&amp;#34; status.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my boyfriend who had lifelong difficulties with oily/combination skin and some acne has found a miracle in this product. His face has NEVER looked so good. Oil production has regulated for him, his acne has cleared, skin tone and overall appearance has improved. GREAT product for oily skin; not at all for dry, sensitive, hormonal skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product about once a week, it is the best cleanser to really shrink those pores after the weekend !</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by the dermatologist I visited.  It is a good cleanser and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  I&#x27;ve used it for over one year now.</li>
            <li> Non-drying, great for sensitive skin. I have been using for probably 5 yrs. and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other product.</li>
            <li> This was prescribed by my dermatologist and I used to purchase from her, but the price was so high.  Buying this online is much more economical!</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser.  I got my first bottle from my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice daily, and it makes the skin feel smooth and a bit tight.  Perfect for the, ahem, mature face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest part?  It is FAST on and FAST off for those busy, okay busy all the times...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only need one pump each wash, so lasts a long time.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 1 week and the cleanser seems to be non-drying and I have rosacea, acne and dermatitis.  With that said, I have tried TONS of cleansers, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it and this one is working, so I do recommend it :-)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with t zone oiliness and this gentle cleanser is perfect! It leaves my skin soft and clean without over-drying it. However, it does not remove eye makeup, so you would need makeup remover for that. Half a pump is enough to wash my entire face and each bottle lasts about half a year. This products works well with a Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> This is best face wash. I just tried it and you can feel and see difference after one time. It lathers up and only need couple pea size to wash entire face and neck area.  This should last a while. Neostrata best product for my face. Then I put on high potency cream.  20% acid. I did have 15% but my daughter took it. Lol. She had breakout on her face and and used my cream and overnight her pimples had cleared up. I found this brand by the dermatologist she used to use. No need anymore because of using Neoatrata products keep breakouts from happening. The high potency cream by Neostrsta Wil change texture of your skin in a short time. I look at photos of myself now and my face is so even and dewy looking and lines are disappearing.  All Neistration products are the best</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so gentle even tho it helps to eleminate the dead skin on my face.  It does not sting or make my face feel dry after cleansing.  It is the polyhydroxide in it that makes it great for my sensitive skin as opposed to alphahydroxy or salisilic acid.  I will continue to use this product as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer after using the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years! Works great!</li>
            <li> Good soap, helps acne.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells very different then the one I purchased at the salon. Beware, I believe this is a knock off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. I also use it with contact lenses in my eyes and there is no problem.</li>
            <li> Been suffering with acne and really dry skin for a couple of years and this cleanser is by far the best product I ever used on my face. Been using it for 2months now. I saw great results within 2 weeks of using it. Absolutely love it and most definitely recommend this facial cleanser to anybody; especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels baby smooth after cleansing.  At first it feels awkward because it&#x27;s non-foaming cleanser, but after the first couple of uses that doesn&#x27;t seem to matter because of how your skin feels after using this product!  LOVING IT!</li>
            <li> I only had this for about a week so far and wow! I noticed my face feeling so much more softer! Best cleanser I have ever had! Wake up in the morning, clean my face with this and I feel so energized! I did not expect these results!</li>
            <li> Great face wash! Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin on my face.  It can break out in the mid T section but drys in other areas.  This soap is perfect.  I like the gel because it seems not as drying. Do not need to use much so it lasts a while for each bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with the results of the product for my acne prone skin.  I also think it has helped some of my wrinkles.  This was recommended by my derma because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Neostrata for several years. When money gets tight, I try something else, but I always come back to Neostrata. It is the best for all skin types. Does not irritate eyes.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this soap for my Rosacea and I&#x27;ve been using it for several years.  I&#x27;ve occasionally tried other gentle cleansers from the drug stores but they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as Neostrata.  The only negative is the exorbitant price but I still continue to pay for it since it keeps my skin so clear without drying it out.</li>
            <li> I use this product religiously. I love this product! My doctors office was closed for the holidays so I ordered from Amazon.... At first it felt like the same product.. but a week later it was clear... fake product.&lt;br /&gt;My face broke out everywhere... like I was in high school all over again.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I purchased the product from my doctor... my face cleared up in a matter of days.&lt;br /&gt;I could immediately feel a difference when I switched back...</li>
