            <li>Let me honestly admit I can not stand the smell of lavender.</li>

            <li>Nice for my shampoo, etc</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully and leaves the body feeling like a new one!</li>

            <li>Excellent and natural.</li>
            <li>Very strong smell is compounded by the fact that the drops come out more like a stream.</li>

            <li>These pure oils are great.</li>
            <li>Only needed a couple drops with baking soda and it smells awesome.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with product and price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember the brand I bought before, but it seemed a bit more potent than this brand.</li>
            <li>I like this oil and will get more.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast service.</li>
            <li>I would prefer an eye dropper in the bottle to be able to dispence the oil without wasting the amount that I would need.</li>

            <li>The Lavender Essential Oil is a quality product with excellent scent.</li>
            <li>However, we found an even better option to kill fleas OVITROL</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than natures oils.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my work bag knowing it&#x27;s safe because it arrives in a bubble wrap pocket with an opening to slide it in and out</li>

            <li>Overall it made my shampoo and conditioner smell wonderful and help out the health of my hair.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes packed in bubble wrap to protect it, but the box it came in was ridiculously huge and kind of wasteful.</li>

            <li>And the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It made my air so shinny and healthy.</li>

            <li>I will definately be using more of this companies products.</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the item yet, but, the shipping was very fast, the price was right, and, I believe this will be great for it&#x27;s intended use.</li>
            <li>The bottle is designed to only dispense a drop or two at a time, which is perfect, because you could quickly over do this.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and pure with a good consistancy and works miracles to help with my insomnia combined with cedar and sandalwood oils rubbed on the bottom of my feet and big toe:)</li>

            <li>the strong alcohol smell like the others had commented.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t quite prepared for how strong the &amp;#34;undiluted&amp;#34; scent would be.  </li>
            <li>its way too strong for me</li>
            <li>I am happy with this oil and would recommend it to anyone who loves EO but not at the price the major companies are selling it for.</li>
            <li>The lavendar oil is exactly as advertised and it is packaged nicely with a dropper.</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful scent.</li>
            <li>but once I got the dosage down, it was very pleasant!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for, very happy with the Plant Therapy Lavender Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>everyone, even my teenager sleeps so much more peacefully and go to sleep quicker!</li>
            <li>The oil is clear and seems fresh and the bottle is great with the dropper built in.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great deal.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for cleaning outside windows.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that this product is organic, important consideration for me.</li>
            <li>So nice that it won&#x27;t take much for what I need.</li>
            <li>This product was genuine lavender oil.</li>
            <li>I also add a few drops on hands and apply it to my hair for a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>that during a time of familial stress that all went so well and smoothly.</li>
            <li>A few drops in a 4 gallon mix and it still packs a wonderful aroma!</li>
            <li>anywhere I want to smell fabulous ....</li>
            <li>I put it on my electric diffuser and it has a cheap, chemical smell.</li>

            <li>Very strong smelling, very concentrated, would buy again.</li>
            <li>There are a number of uses for lavender, and though I haven&#x27;t tried some of them, I am excited about the possibilities with this product.</li>

            <li>I wanted to send a note of thanks to my sister who had done something wonderful when our aged mother had a setback.</li>
            <li>There are some single types (lavender, grapefruit) and some blends (relaxing, sensual) - they all smell great.</li>
            <li>I have tried other oils, but these are absolutely the best!</li>
            <li>I love the relaxing scent and the fact that it&#x27;s real lavendar.  </li>
            <li>I recently learned that lavendar oil is good for burns and tried it when some olive oil spattered on my arm from the pot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this was a manufacturing error, but doesn&#x27;t help me too much.</li>
            <li>I am a true believer of this product.</li>
            <li>super relaxing right before bedtime!</li>
            <li>The Plant Therapy Lavender Essential Oil has such a wonderful, relaxing scent.  </li>
            <li>I used it in a sugar scrub, and a few drops made the whole batch smell delicious without being over powering.</li>
            <li>Super product</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again, this lavender is exceptional.</li>
            <li>Always ships and arrives quickly and is packaged well.  </li>
            <li>Received it quickly.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you want to spend over $30.00 for a tiny bottle, I would say this one is second best.</li>
            <li>I have been falling asleep quickly and with fewer wake ups.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several different types of oils and I am very happy with all of them.  </li>
            <li>i do love the scent of fresh lavendar, but i was very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>so dont expect a quick result.</li>
            <li>It is a high quality oil that has a lovely aroma.</li>
            <li>Keeps me calm, cool and collected.</li>
            <li>Love the laendar drops put them in my bath and a few drops on my pillow, such a relaxing and wonderful lavendar smell.</li>
            <li>The aroma is pure, soothing and strong.</li>
            <li>Such a clear and beautiful scent.  </li>
            <li>I received my merchandise very quickly without much delay.</li>
            <li>Their oils cost a little little more than some of the brands that aren&#x27;t the best quality,but less than the known top brands (like trilogy )that are good in quality.</li>
            <li>great product, as expected, high quality, will do business again!</li>
            <li>I just placed a few drops in with the water and it smelled so great while mopping.  </li>
            <li>My whole house still smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I still use the lavender diluted in water (just a few drops (2 or 3)  in 4oz of water) to keep my pup smelling great.</li>
            <li>what a fantastic fix to a problem that has been very aggravating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love all of the oils I have received so far.</li>
            <li>I chose Plant Therapy when I asked my niece about Essential Oils, she said Plant Therapy was a Good Quality oil and the prices were reasonable.</li>
            <li>The product was simply not what I was looking for oil-wise, although it is a nice aroma.  </li>
            <li>They have been really effective for each specific reason that were to be used.</li>
            <li>Lavender is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>it didnt have that beautifull aroma of fresh lilac</li>
            <li>Purchased three different oils from Plant Therapy and liked them</li>
            <li>My husband and daughter call it my witch brew and even made fun of me for it.</li>
            <li>Like the old folks say \\&quot;patience is virtue\\&quot; and i am definately going to buy more when this one finishes.</li>
            <li>It seemed to heal pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can say that the product was exactly what I purchased and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>This brand is just right for my budget</li>
            <li>The gift arrived promptly and my sister used it right away.</li>
            <li>said this would help and she was right.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to help calm an anxious dog &amp; it worked great.</li>
            <li>Exactly what the wife was looking great for our daughters baths, just a few drops and she loves the aroma.</li>
            <li>It was quick, the products were beautifully packaged, and it looks like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I use essential oils to rejuvenate poetpourri, and Plant Therapy oils are hands down the best that I have found.  </li>
            <li>This product will be going in my daughter&#x27;s Christmas stocking as she uses the lavender essential oil mixed with vodka (you read that right) and water and puts it in a spray bottle for the best freshener (all natural) for her home.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only really used two, the orange for homemade laundry detergent (which smells fabulous) and the lavender (my favorite) for some homemade body lotion and I</li>
            <li>Very fragrant and a true lavender smell.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t change the fact that when it&#x27;s mixed with a little vanilla or lemon, it smells delicious.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>Came quickly and I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>I mixed a few drops of this oil with water and spray it throughout the house; it leaves every room smelling wonderful and the fragrance remains for hours....</li>
            <li>The most useful essential oil.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast, and I did not have any issues with the supplier.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Update: have ordered this several more times.</li>
            <li>The quality is quite consistent.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li>The watery consistency is more troubling to me though since it kind of pours too fast rather than dripping slowly from the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love essential oils in my bath.  </li>
            <li>It really works wonders!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to not just make bath salts but may even have enough for bath fizzies.</li>
            <li>I saw it absorbs better mixed with carrier oil.</li>
            <li>I love the properties of this oil and it is the go to oil of essential oils.</li>
            <li>The packaging was very well done!</li>
            <li>Definitely will order more</li>
            <li>I have tried many different lavenders ..</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered from this company and I&#x27;ll say that all my expectations were met.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product overall.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>It was my first time to use Lavender Oil</li>
            <li>This is great in a warm vibrating foot bath with epsom salt on a cold night; Very relaxing for us.</li>
            <li>Grade\\&quot; since there is no definition of the term.&lt;br /&gt;I learned my lesson, I will research better next time, before I buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again when I run out. :)</li>
            <li>I used 25 drops to about one cup of ingredients and it was more than enough to scent the product.</li>
            <li>Prompt service and the product was exactly as it was described, I would order again from this company.  </li>
            <li>I love this bottle of lavender essential oil!</li>
            <li>I decided to use this and accidentally overused it on my first time</li>
            <li>I also put a few drops in unscented handsoap and it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>but since I have started putting a few drops on my pillows, I&#x27;ve had some of the best night sleeps in a long time!</li>
            <li>The Lavender scent is clear and clean and is not overpowered by an oil scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought this oil to clean my mattresses the natural way.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops gives it a fresh nice scent.</li>
            <li>My first purchases of the pure oils for use for my bedding, my sons, and for bath time.</li>
            <li>so it was going pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was hoping for - great scent and quality for less than any of the local retail stores in my area are charging.</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the bottle and took a whiff, I could tell that this was pure undiluted lavender oil.  </li>
            <li>Definitely pure just like it says.  </li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]</li>
            <li>The scent of this oil seems so pure and transports me to a field of flowers.  </li>
            <li>If Pure and Undiluted Lavender Essdential Oil is what you are looking for, than this is the  destination.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered this lavender essential oil previously to scent my towels (works great for that,</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>I rubbed some on my temples and neck and it really helped</li>
            <li>I mix 10 drops of the essential oil in a 32 oz spray bottle and use to spray (lightly) on the dogs as well as furniture coverings, dog bed, etc.</li>
            <li>The smell is spot on, very soothing.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m very pleased that Amazon.com offers products such as the essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Works just as well as oil that costs over twice as much.</li>
            <li>Very well wrapped for shipping.  </li>
            <li>This oil is very calming and has even helped with my allergies.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this, it&#x27;s a very relaxing scent to have around.  </li>
            <li>very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>This product is really theraputic grade.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than at the health food store.</li>
            <li>It either comes out not at all or too fast.</li>
            <li>my bed sheets helps me sleep very well.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing; I only wish they sold their products in larger sizes or had some recycling program for the cute little \\&quot;used\\&quot; bottles because I plan to keep buying a lot of them.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several different brands and this is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>I found the quality of this to be just as good as some of the more expensive essential oils.</li>
            <li>Will consider this company for future orders of homeopathic and essential oils:-)</li>
            <li>I love lavendar and essential oil on front and back of palm while I work is heaven.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;s a little bit strong at first, but now it feels soothing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have my hopes up for a high grade oil.</li>
            <li>If you have no other oil in your arsenal, buy this one!!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it will last me awhile since I will only be using a few drops a week.</li>
            <li>this item is completely overpriced, I realized it after I had bought it already - you can buy a 2 oz bottle (that is 6 times as much content) for $ 12.50 from Now on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy other oils for my own personal and professional use!</li>
            <li>I used it straight up for a while and enjoyed it, but there is a small volume</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford the concentrated French version these days, so I ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is good; it doesn&#x27;t smell fake or cheap like</li>
            <li>For a Lavendar oil, this has the distinct back of a musky wood.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many oils in the past and most seems to be a little thicker than this brand.</li>
            <li>I use this mixed with spearmint and grapeseed carrier oil to make a nice little soothing oil to rub on my temples when I have a headache.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be coming back to order more from this vendor and highly recommend them for all your essential oil needs.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying essential oils.</li>
            <li>However, I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>First time buying any type of essential oil and will buy again.</li>
            <li>This is a potent essential oil and it is going to serve my purposes extremely well...</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing essential oils.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing  essential oil</li>
            <li>Using this oil in my diffuser, in my homemade lotion and in homemade bath salts, I clearly adore this oil.  </li>
            <li>It may not be from Bon Vital or TheraPro, but Plant Therapy delivers and then some.</li>
            <li>They say, &amp;#34;when in doubt use lavender&amp;#34; &amp; I completely agree.</li>
            <li>Im a newcomer to essential oils and havent used for much beyond bathtime and on my pillow.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand of lavender essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I use it directly on my skin and in bath water</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been up early (and I am NOT a morning person) and within minutes of my head hitting the pillow, I&#x27;m asleep.</li>
            <li>and the smell is fresh, and not chemically like I expected.</li>
            <li>I used this product to make an excellent soap made with a goose fat base.  </li>
            <li>High quality, no different to me than the Young Living oils and way cheaper!</li>
            <li>This bottle seems a little more peppery than other lavenders I&#x27;ve smelled, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the lavender essential oil!  </li>
            <li>I had hoped it would smell like the essential oil I got where I used to live.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much so this bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve made a terrific body scrub with sea salt, almond oil for the carrier, and the lavender.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like I expected.</li>
            <li>I plan on using my lavender oil as part of a recipe for natural insecticide inside the house as I&#x27;ve not only humans but indoor pets as well and do not want to use chemicals indoors.  </li>
            <li>However, be careful because the drops come out really fast since there is no dropper included</li>
            <li>if I an having a procedure to calm me down especially like an MRI.</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering this type of product online, but I plan to try the other essential oils also.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had luck with it completely disappearing, but they definitely get smaller.</li>
            <li>im sorry, but you need to know.im here to edit my own personal experience with this lilac oil.</li>
            <li>Very strong scent--one drop is more than enough to dab behind your ears or on your pillow case if you&#x27;re use using to help fall asleep (although, haven&#x27;t had any luck in that department using this, unfortunately).</li>
            <li>not as high quality as expected</li>
            <li>I combined several drops of this Lavendar Essential Oil and several drops of the Orange Essential Oil from the same company in a spray bottle with water and started misting the area around a piece of furniture on which one of my older cats had started urinating on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having said that, I&#x27;m overall very satisified with my purchase and will try some of the other oils.</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 different scents from this company and barely had to wait until they were delivered to me.</li>
            <li>the level of liquid in the bottle barely moved so I will have plenty for future projects.</li>

            <li> It smells so good</li>
            <li> Used it to make lotion bars and everyone loved them and the lavender scent.  </li>

            <li> These pure oils are great.</li>

            <li> Great product, fast service.</li>
            <li> I would prefer an eye dropper in the bottle to be able to dispence the oil without wasting the amount that I would need.</li>

            <li> The Lavender Essential Oil is a quality product with excellent scent.</li>
            <li> However, we found an even better option to kill fleas OVITROL</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than natures oils.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my work bag knowing it&#x27;s safe because it arrives in a bubble wrap pocket with an opening to slide it in and out</li>

            <li> I like that it comes packed in bubble wrap to protect it, but the box it came in was ridiculously huge and kind of wasteful.</li>
            <li> so I purchased more.</li>
            <li> And the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It made my air so shinny and healthy.</li>

            <li> This is the perfect product to buy if you are just getting into essential oils.</li>
            <li> Was delivered fast and smells great.</li>
            <li> I will definately be using more of this companies products.</li>

            <li> The bottle is designed to only dispense a drop or two at a time, which is perfect, because you could quickly over do this.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and pure with a good consistancy and works miracles to help with my insomnia combined with cedar and sandalwood oils rubbed on the bottom of my feet and big toe:)</li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite prepared for how strong the &amp;#34;undiluted&amp;#34; scent would be.  </li>
            <li> its way too strong for me</li>
            <li> I am happy with this oil and would recommend it to anyone who loves EO but not at the price the major companies are selling it for.</li>

            <li> I wanted to send a note of thanks to my sister who had done something wonderful when our aged mother had a setback.</li>
            <li> There are some single types (lavender, grapefruit) and some blends (relaxing, sensual) - they all smell great.</li>
            <li> I have tried other oils, but these are absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> I love the relaxing scent and the fact that it&#x27;s real lavendar.  </li>
            <li> I recently learned that lavendar oil is good for burns and tried it when some olive oil spattered on my arm from the pot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this was a manufacturing error, but doesn&#x27;t help me too much.</li>

            <li> Received it quickly.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you want to spend over $30.00 for a tiny bottle, I would say this one is second best.</li>
            <li> I have been falling asleep quickly and with fewer wake ups.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several different types of oils and I am very happy with all of them.  </li>
            <li> i do love the scent of fresh lavendar, but i was very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> quick delivery.</li>
            <li> so dont expect a quick result.</li>
            <li> It is a high quality oil that has a lovely aroma.</li>
            <li> Keeps me calm, cool and collected.</li>
            <li> Love the laendar drops put them in my bath and a few drops on my pillow, such a relaxing and wonderful lavendar smell.</li>
            <li> The aroma is pure, soothing and strong.</li>
            <li> Such a clear and beautiful scent.  </li>
            <li> I received my merchandise very quickly without much delay.</li>
            <li> Their oils cost a little little more than some of the brands that aren&#x27;t the best quality,but less than the known top brands (like trilogy )that are good in quality.</li>
            <li> great product, as expected, high quality, will do business again!</li>
            <li> I just placed a few drops in with the water and it smelled so great while mopping.  </li>
            <li> My whole house still smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I still use the lavender diluted in water (just a few drops (2 or 3)  in 4oz of water) to keep my pup smelling great.</li>
            <li> what a fantastic fix to a problem that has been very aggravating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love all of the oils I have received so far.</li>
            <li> I chose Plant Therapy when I asked my niece about Essential Oils, she said Plant Therapy was a Good Quality oil and the prices were reasonable.</li>
            <li> The product was simply not what I was looking for oil-wise, although it is a nice aroma.  </li>
            <li> They have been really effective for each specific reason that were to be used.</li>
            <li> Lavender is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> it didnt have that beautifull aroma of fresh lilac</li>
            <li> Purchased three different oils from Plant Therapy and liked them</li>
            <li> My husband and daughter call it my witch brew and even made fun of me for it.</li>
            <li> Like the old folks say \\&quot;patience is virtue\\&quot; and i am definately going to buy more when this one finishes.</li>
            <li> It seemed to heal pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can say that the product was exactly what I purchased and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> This brand is just right for my budget</li>
            <li> The gift arrived promptly and my sister used it right away.</li>
            <li> said this would help and she was right.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to help calm an anxious dog &amp; it worked great.</li>
            <li> Exactly what the wife was looking great for our daughters baths, just a few drops and she loves the aroma.</li>
            <li> It was quick, the products were beautifully packaged, and it looks like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use essential oils to rejuvenate poetpourri, and Plant Therapy oils are hands down the best that I have found.  </li>
            <li> This product will be going in my daughter&#x27;s Christmas stocking as she uses the lavender essential oil mixed with vodka (you read that right) and water and puts it in a spray bottle for the best freshener (all natural) for her home.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only really used two, the orange for homemade laundry detergent (which smells fabulous) and the lavender (my favorite) for some homemade body lotion and I</li>
            <li> Very fragrant and a true lavender smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t change the fact that when it&#x27;s mixed with a little vanilla or lemon, it smells delicious.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> Came quickly and I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li> I mixed a few drops of this oil with water and spray it throughout the house; it leaves every room smelling wonderful and the fragrance remains for hours....</li>
            <li> The most useful essential oil.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast, and I did not have any issues with the supplier.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Update: have ordered this several more times.</li>
            <li> The quality is quite consistent.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> The watery consistency is more troubling to me though since it kind of pours too fast rather than dripping slowly from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils in my bath.  </li>
            <li> It really works wonders!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to not just make bath salts but may even have enough for bath fizzies.</li>
            <li> I saw it absorbs better mixed with carrier oil.</li>
            <li> I love the properties of this oil and it is the go to oil of essential oils.</li>
            <li> The packaging was very well done!</li>
            <li> Definitely will order more</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lavenders ..</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered from this company and I&#x27;ll say that all my expectations were met.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product overall.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> It was my first time to use Lavender Oil</li>
            <li> This is great in a warm vibrating foot bath with epsom salt on a cold night; Very relaxing for us.</li>
            <li> Grade\\&quot; since there is no definition of the term.&lt;br /&gt;I learned my lesson, I will research better next time, before I buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> I used 25 drops to about one cup of ingredients and it was more than enough to scent the product.</li>
            <li> Prompt service and the product was exactly as it was described, I would order again from this company.  </li>
            <li> I love this bottle of lavender essential oil!</li>
            <li> I decided to use this and accidentally overused it on my first time</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops in unscented handsoap and it smells so good.  </li>
            <li> but since I have started putting a few drops on my pillows, I&#x27;ve had some of the best night sleeps in a long time!</li>
            <li> The Lavender scent is clear and clean and is not overpowered by an oil scent.  </li>
            <li> I bought this oil to clean my mattresses the natural way.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops gives it a fresh nice scent.</li>
            <li> My first purchases of the pure oils for use for my bedding, my sons, and for bath time.</li>
            <li> so it was going pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was hoping for - great scent and quality for less than any of the local retail stores in my area are charging.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the bottle and took a whiff, I could tell that this was pure undiluted lavender oil.  </li>
            <li> Definitely pure just like it says.  </li>
            <li> 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]</li>
            <li> The scent of this oil seems so pure and transports me to a field of flowers.  </li>
            <li> If Pure and Undiluted Lavender Essdential Oil is what you are looking for, than this is the  destination.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered this lavender essential oil previously to scent my towels (works great for that,</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> I rubbed some on my temples and neck and it really helped</li>
            <li> I mix 10 drops of the essential oil in a 32 oz spray bottle and use to spray (lightly) on the dogs as well as furniture coverings, dog bed, etc.</li>
            <li> The smell is spot on, very soothing.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m very pleased that Amazon.com offers products such as the essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Works just as well as oil that costs over twice as much.</li>
            <li> Very well wrapped for shipping.  </li>
            <li> This oil is very calming and has even helped with my allergies.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this, it&#x27;s a very relaxing scent to have around.  </li>
            <li> very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> This product is really theraputic grade.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than at the health food store.</li>
            <li> It either comes out not at all or too fast.</li>
            <li> my bed sheets helps me sleep very well.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing; I only wish they sold their products in larger sizes or had some recycling program for the cute little \\&quot;used\\&quot; bottles because I plan to keep buying a lot of them.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several different brands and this is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> I found the quality of this to be just as good as some of the more expensive essential oils.</li>
            <li> Will consider this company for future orders of homeopathic and essential oils:-)</li>
            <li> I love lavendar and essential oil on front and back of palm while I work is heaven.</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;s a little bit strong at first, but now it feels soothing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have my hopes up for a high grade oil.</li>
            <li> If you have no other oil in your arsenal, buy this one!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it will last me awhile since I will only be using a few drops a week.</li>
            <li> this item is completely overpriced, I realized it after I had bought it already - you can buy a 2 oz bottle (that is 6 times as much content) for $ 12.50 from Now on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy other oils for my own personal and professional use!</li>
            <li> I used it straight up for a while and enjoyed it, but there is a small volume</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford the concentrated French version these days, so I ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is good; it doesn&#x27;t smell fake or cheap like</li>
            <li> For a Lavendar oil, this has the distinct back of a musky wood.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many oils in the past and most seems to be a little thicker than this brand.</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with spearmint and grapeseed carrier oil to make a nice little soothing oil to rub on my temples when I have a headache.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be coming back to order more from this vendor and highly recommend them for all your essential oil needs.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying essential oils.</li>
            <li> However, I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> First time buying any type of essential oil and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a potent essential oil and it is going to serve my purposes extremely well...</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing essential oils.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing  essential oil</li>
            <li> Using this oil in my diffuser, in my homemade lotion and in homemade bath salts, I clearly adore this oil.  </li>
            <li> It may not be from Bon Vital or TheraPro, but Plant Therapy delivers and then some.</li>
            <li> They say, &amp;#34;when in doubt use lavender&amp;#34; &amp; I completely agree.</li>
            <li> Im a newcomer to essential oils and havent used for much beyond bathtime and on my pillow.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of lavender essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I use it directly on my skin and in bath water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been up early (and I am NOT a morning person) and within minutes of my head hitting the pillow, I&#x27;m asleep.</li>
            <li> and the smell is fresh, and not chemically like I expected.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make an excellent soap made with a goose fat base.  </li>
            <li> High quality, no different to me than the Young Living oils and way cheaper!</li>
            <li> This bottle seems a little more peppery than other lavenders I&#x27;ve smelled, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the lavender essential oil!  </li>
            <li> I had hoped it would smell like the essential oil I got where I used to live.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much so this bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve made a terrific body scrub with sea salt, almond oil for the carrier, and the lavender.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like I expected.</li>
            <li> I plan on using my lavender oil as part of a recipe for natural insecticide inside the house as I&#x27;ve not only humans but indoor pets as well and do not want to use chemicals indoors.  </li>
            <li> However, be careful because the drops come out really fast since there is no dropper included</li>
            <li> if I an having a procedure to calm me down especially like an MRI.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering this type of product online, but I plan to try the other essential oils also.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had luck with it completely disappearing, but they definitely get smaller.</li>
            <li> im sorry, but you need to know.im here to edit my own personal experience with this lilac oil.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent--one drop is more than enough to dab behind your ears or on your pillow case if you&#x27;re use using to help fall asleep (although, haven&#x27;t had any luck in that department using this, unfortunately).</li>
            <li> not as high quality as expected</li>
            <li> I combined several drops of this Lavendar Essential Oil and several drops of the Orange Essential Oil from the same company in a spray bottle with water and started misting the area around a piece of furniture on which one of my older cats had started urinating on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having said that, I&#x27;m overall very satisified with my purchase and will try some of the other oils.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 different scents from this company and barely had to wait until they were delivered to me.</li>
            <li> the level of liquid in the bottle barely moved so I will have plenty for future projects.</li>
            <li> To me, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like, but personally, I want to smell it on myself all the time, because it keeps me in a stable mood.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you put it on when you first feel a hard bump it should go away.</li>
            <li> The smell does not last long either.</li>
            <li> I actually got this for leg cramps which does wonders, but just a drop anywhere amazes me how long the smell stays with you</li>
            <li> tho this is slightly mentholated that isn&#x27;t a deterrent as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li> Love putting in my cold air humidifier.</li>
            <li> so I put a few drops in their bath to clear their sinus out.</li>
            <li> I bought en empty bottle to mix this with jojoba oil to apply on entire face.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product in March but didn&#x27;t open it until today to find that the bottle was COMPLETELY EMPTY.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry scalp</li>
            <li> A few drops of lavender at bedtime usually guarantees me a peaceful nights sleep</li>
            <li> I hope you can offer larger sizes even if slightly diluted.</li>
            <li> The only thing, and this isn&#x27;t really a complaint, is that I prefer my lavender oil to not have a &#x27;menthol&#x27; scent which is why I typically order lavender Vera or french lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on timely fashion, and little goes a long long way!</li>
            <li> I used these for my dryer balls and did not really care for</li>
            <li> Not very fond of it.</li>
            <li> I can smell the lavender (in a close container, inside a closed medicine cabinet) from about 20 feet away.  </li>
            <li> Arrived just as expected.</li>
            <li> I just used it in one of my products, and it seemed to work just as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Not much of a floral lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help with flea control, but when the bottle arrived it was empty.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses a few drops of lavender essential oil in her bath to help her relax.  </li>
            <li> It is concentrated, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Check on line for other uses besides bath water.</li>
            <li> The options are endless.</li>
            <li> I just moved and lost both my collection of essential oils and the store I usually go to replace them.</li>
            <li> it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other oils from plant theraphy</li>
            <li> I like to wear at night time, and I also like to add to other oils I use, oils that don&#x27;t have any scent.  </li>
            <li> other inexpensive oils have.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it myself, so I won&#x27;t give the 5 stars as I&#x27;m not sure how it measures up to my regular brand.</li>
            <li> This small bottle only contains 1/3 of an ounce!!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the liquid dried up because the inside is bone dry and doesn&#x27;t even smell like lavender.</li>
            <li> Works well with lavender oil for acne, blemishes dark</li>
            <li> I never had nail fungus until I stubbed my toe really badly last year and it slowly grew under the nail bed.  </li>
            <li> She is slightly OCD and this is soothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not intolerable, but it&#x27;s not really true lavender either.  </li>
            <li> It helps to add a little something else than the smell of vinegar.</li>
            <li> I use it whenever I feel a little nauseous.</li>
            <li> Too small an amount although this was purer than the other oils.</li>
            <li> little things count</li>
            <li> I use this in my yoga classes, I pour a little on a towel and then wave the towel over students in shavasana.  </li>
            <li> I thought this oil was a little watery and the aroma is a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> I put a little on my trouble areas a few times a week and haven&#x27;t had anymore problems.</li>
            <li> I had trouble measuring 10-30 drops, which is what my recipe called for.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of the oil on my pillowcase as suggested by my doctor to help with a sleep issue.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops on a tissue when I travel and pack it with my clothes.</li>
            <li> I put it on my pillow a few nights a week</li>
            <li> It was too late to return this item because the &#x27;return window&#x27; has closed.  </li>
            <li> am waiting for something really special.the price wasnt bad either.i am going to collect some others as well.i</li>
            <li> Not sure where she got the recipe</li>
            <li> Basically I paid $10 for a small glass bottle with nothing in it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it even on my jojoba oil and tea tree oil mix for aiding acne on my skin face in the past.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because the dropper is hard to use and to measure the number of drops that are being used.</li>
            <li> The bottle has a built in dropper so the liquid comes out slowly.  </li>
            <li> It smells very little like Lavender!</li>
            <li> Also, really helped with a nasty headache the other day.</li>
            <li> I bought this essential oil because I wanted to do a tea tree oil spray and wanted to add the lavender so the smell of the tea tree oil would not be so bad.  </li>
            <li> The aroma is not good to use to cover bad&lt;br /&gt;odors ether.  </li>
            <li> I was having a tough time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t dilute as the scent decreased.</li>
            <li> I am using it in combo with lemongrass &amp; peppermint oils in water as a flea treatment for my poor flea.suffering beach dog.  </li>
            <li> Poor customer service.</li>
            <li> I put it behind my ears at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I use this for a lot of things such as a room deodorizer, mosquito repellent, bug bite salve and for relaxation.</li>
            <li> Makes both my daughter and I a little sick.</li>
            <li> the dropper is useless on all three of them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I think it has some type of leak in it, as the container is always sticky and</li>
            <li> i wanted to buy some EO but sellers for YL and DoTerra were just too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is another oil that I purchased that isn&#x27;t one of the expensive ones</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product, it just wasn&#x27;t the type of natural/essential oil I wanted.</li>
            <li> I put about two drops on my pillow when I feel difficult to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am doing it wrong.  </li>
            <li> Not even a faint whiff of lavender when I opened it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; in this country, the term is meaningless, and often used as just marketing hype.  </li>
            <li> I also like the faint scent that settles on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> some lavender&#x27;s can have the fake smell to it, these however do not.</li>
            <li> The quantity is also disappointing.</li>
            <li> I would never buy this again, it is expensive and worthless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to just add one or two drops because it just comes POURING out.</li>
            <li> Until I used it on him for some really bad bug bites (with tea tree oil).</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use as an insect repellent - specifically to help keep the fleas away (awful flea year this year), I think it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It did not work and she smelled horrible.</li>
            <li> it was a a terrible scent.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this to use in making homemade baby wipes.  The smell is great and it will last me awhile since I will only be using a few drops a week.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve ordered this from Plant Therapy twice now - very strong and pleasant lavender oil. Works great for keeping insects at bay, with light seasonal allergies and also just for relaxing in the bath. Highly recommended, especially considering the price.  Update: have ordered this several more times. The quality is quite consistent.</li>
            <li> I used these for my dryer balls and did not really care for the strong alcohol smell like the others had commented. The smell does not last long either.</li>
            <li> I bought this essential oil because I wanted to do a tea tree oil spray and wanted to add the lavender so the smell of the tea tree oil would not be so bad.  Ever since my daughter had the case of the lice I have been constantly searching online on ways to help prevent her from ever getting them again.  I saw that doing a tea tree oil spray helps.  The lavender oil is an added bonus to the spray to make it smell wonderful.  My daughter loves the smell.  I would definitely purchase this again whenever I run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was reading reviews about people using it for cysts under the skin (for cystic acne). If you put it on when you first feel a hard bump it should go away. I haven&#x27;t had luck with it completely disappearing, but they definitely get smaller. But it smells great.</li>
            <li> ...both the product and the delivery. I ordered 4 different scents from this company and barely had to wait until they were delivered to me. It was quick, the products were beautifully packaged, and it looks like they will last a long time. I&#x27;ve only really used two, the orange for homemade laundry detergent (which smells fabulous) and the lavender (my favorite) for some homemade body lotion and I the level of liquid in the bottle barely moved so I will have plenty for future projects. Can&#x27;t wait to use the lemon and tangerine! I will definitely be coming back to order more from this vendor and highly recommend them for all your essential oil needs.</li>
            <li> Purchased the Lavender oil to make an all purpose cleaner. It has a nice fragrance and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> We use this to cut the smell of vinegar in homemade cleaning products.  It helps to add a little something else than the smell of vinegar.</li>
            <li> Very nice lavender oil! I use it whenever I feel a little nauseous. The shipping was very fast, and I did not have any issues with the supplier.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to clean my mattresses the natural way. Only needed a couple drops with baking soda and it smells awesome. Also, really helped with a nasty headache the other day. I rubbed some on my temples and neck and it really helped</li>
            <li> Purchesed this before and still a great product.  It is concentrated, so a little goes a long way.  Check on line for other uses besides bath water.</li>
            <li> Too small an amount although this was purer than the other oils. I didn&#x27;t dilute as the scent decreased. I hope you can offer larger sizes even if slightly diluted.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast and I bought the oil to use in homemade hand cream that our church circle makes for the ladies in nursing homes.  Just a few drops gives it a fresh nice scent.</li>
            <li> Lavender is part of my three essential oils minimum package with eucalyptus and tea tree. I use lavender for relaxation and for my kids if they have agitated nights or nightmares.</li>
            <li> My mother brought back some lavender oil from overseas travel. My boys liked to have a drop or two of &amp;#34;grandma smell&amp;#34; under their pillow or on their blankets at bedtime. When that ran out I purchased this to continue the tradition and help them relax and sleep. This is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know enough about the various oils to make any comment about the quality. But I do know that it smells like I was expecting. (It did when I bought it and it still does a year later.)</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, but not overpowering.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is truly therapeutic grade essential oil.  As soon as I opened the bottle and took a whiff, I could tell that this was pure undiluted lavender oil.  I am pleased with product and price.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased lavender oil.  I don&#x27;t remember the brand I bought before, but it seemed a bit more potent than this brand.</li>
            <li> I love the relaxing scent and the fact that it&#x27;s real lavendar.  I bought this to add to baths and homemade hair products and I am happy with it.  I recently learned that lavendar oil is good for burns and tried it when some olive oil spattered on my arm from the pot.  It seemed to heal pretty quickly.  I like this oil and will get more.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast service. Thank you</li>
            <li> So calming and relaxing it puts me and my husband to bed at night. I sprinkle it on our pillows and rub it on our foreheads. It smells 100% organic I keep buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this to add fragrance to my homemade Shea mixture for my skin. Worked great and I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I would prefer an eye dropper in the bottle to be able to dispence the oil without wasting the amount that I would need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put a few drops of this in my diaper pail, and it really helps. Also put some on the bathroom mat (just to add a touch of scent to the bathroom), some on the corner of the curtains in the guest bedroom, etc. The options are endless. Overall a great deal.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several different brands and this is my absolute favorite.  The Lavender scent is clear and clean and is not overpowered by an oil scent.  This is the only brand I will purchase from now on.</li>
            <li> Keeps me calm, cool and collected. I purchased this for a craft I wanted to do. I haven&#x27;t done the craft as yet but I have enjoyed this Lavender oil many times already.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that if you mix it with water it&#x27;s great for cleaning outside windows.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it yet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this essential oil to make my owm pillow mist. I absolutely love it! I plan to buy other oils for my own personal and professional use! Thank you for great quality!</li>
            <li> I keep ordering oils from Plant Therapy and they don&#x27;t disappoint. I love all of the oils I have received so far. There are some single types (lavender, grapefruit) and some blends (relaxing, sensual) - they all smell great. The next time I order I will see if the blends come in larger size bottles because they are almost gone already! These are great quality oils.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Purchased it to make laundry detergent but keep finding myself putting in on me to smell on day. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use as an insect repellent - specifically to help keep the fleas away (awful flea year this year), I think it&#x27;s helping. And, the smell is wonderful. I mix 10 drops of the essential oil in a 32 oz spray bottle and use to spray (lightly) on the dogs as well as furniture coverings, dog bed, etc. I like the fact that this product is organic, important consideration for me.</li>
            <li> smells fantastic! i cant wait to use it.i am waiting for something really special.the price wasnt bad either.i am going to collect some others as well.i hope your selection expands.</li>
            <li> Such a clear and beautiful scent.  The oil is clear and seems fresh and the bottle is great with the dropper built in.  Came quickly and I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle.  I&#x27;m ordering all my oils from them now.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell is compounded by the fact that the drops come out more like a stream. It&#x27;s almost impossible to just add one or two drops because it just comes POURING out. I have 3 oils from the same manufacturer and the dropper is useless on all three of them.</li>
            <li> Definitely pure just like it says.  I have used it in all sorts of my homemade products.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like the quality of this oil. I just started using oils for my diffuser and also dabbing on my wrists.  Smells great and good quality.</li>
            <li> The lavendar oil is exactly as advertised and it is packaged nicely with a dropper. The shipping was very fast. I will definitely buy more oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> I am using it in combo with lemongrass &amp; peppermint oils in water as a flea treatment for my poor flea.suffering beach dog.  Cannot yet tell if it works, but the Amazon part of the process was, as always. good!</li>
            <li> Has a medicine smell. Not very fond of it.</li>
            <li> I have found no difference between this product and my Do Terra Lavender Essential Oil so I&#x27;m sold!  Very nice product for a great price!</li>
            <li> I thought this oil was a little watery and the aroma is a bit harsh. I prefer a more mellow lavender aroma. The watery consistency is more troubling to me though since it kind of pours too fast rather than dripping slowly from the bottle. I&#x27;ve bought many oils in the past and most seems to be a little thicker than this brand.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed. Love the scent.</li>
            <li> I use essential oils to rejuvenate poetpourri, and Plant Therapy oils are hands down the best that I have found.  Potent and long-lasting, these oils add a refreshing, relaxing, and enlivening scent to every room of the house.  I have tried other oils, but these are absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> Great product and of the highest quality. I used it straight up for a while and enjoyed it, but there is a small volume so it was going pretty fast. I found that I got the same effects when diluting 50/50 with some unscented essential oil or some almond oil.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils in my bath.  A few drops of lavender at bedtime usually guarantees me a peaceful nights sleep</li>
            <li> I love this. The smell is spot on, very soothing. I use this mixed with spearmint and grapeseed carrier oil to make a nice little soothing oil to rub on my temples when I have a headache.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying essential oils. I was looking for something to help in relaxation and this did it! It only takes a couple  drops, and the lavender scent helps you to sit back and relax. It really works wonders!</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m very pleased that Amazon.com offers products such as the essential oils.  The prices are very reasonable, and with Prime shipping, it&#x27;s an incredible bargain.  The Plant Therapy Lavender Essential Oil has such a wonderful, relaxing scent.  So far, I&#x27;ve made a terrific body scrub with sea salt, almond oil for the carrier, and the lavender.  I&#x27;ll be ordering from Plant Therapy (through Amazon, of course) again.</li>
            <li> Great smell and affordability.  This lavender oil smells just like lavender!  I use it in a diffuser and love it.</li>
            <li> yum...smells so nice.  I use it for bath salts...so refreshing and relaxing.  My family also enjoys the bath salts.  Makes nice gifts.</li>
            <li> The product is as described, and provides a wonderful, clean fragrance.  I am still researching various ways to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved lavender and find it most relaxing when I&#x27;m ready to retire at night. Most satisfied and delighted with this.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality essential oil with a very pleasant scent. I will definitely order again and refer to a friend.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful. So nice that it won&#x27;t take much for what I need. I&#x27;ll be able to not just make bath salts but may even have enough for bath fizzies.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like I expected. I had hoped it would smell like the essential oil I got where I used to live. The quantity is also disappointing.</li>
            <li> Homeopathic for me if I an having a procedure to calm me down especially like an MRI. Use it on my dogs to help reduce their stress. Always have on hand,</li>
            <li> This product was genuine lavender oil. The price for the amount was excellent. I had trouble measuring 10-30 drops, which is what my recipe called for. An eye dropper would be helpful for this. Overall, I was very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> The oil arrived on time and smells absolutely amazing.  Unfortunately I think it has some type of leak in it, as the container is always sticky and I can smell the lavender (in a close container, inside a closed medicine cabinet) from about 20 feet away.  All in all, still very happy I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make an excellent soap made with a goose fat base.  This product smells wonderful and I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
            <li> Makes both my daughter and I a little sick. I don&#x27;t care for this lavender. Wish they did refunds. Poor customer service.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. It may not be from Bon Vital or TheraPro, but Plant Therapy delivers and then some. Great price, quick delivery, even though was not offered as prime. I am a licensed massage therapist, and I like to incorporate aromatherapy into some of my session, when it is appropriate. Would definitely buy from this seller again, and definitely recommend them to someone else. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance and therapeutic essential oil.</li>
            <li> There are a number of uses for lavender, and though I haven&#x27;t tried some of them, I am excited about the possibilities with this product. This is exactly what I was looking for, very happy with the Plant Therapy Lavender Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> I love lavender oil, but it can be expensive. This brand is just right for my budget and it is wonderful oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome for skin! I apply it on redmarks and it seems to reduce the redness a lot! My pimples also dried so fast and it is minimizing.  I use aloe vera(fresh) three times daily so that probably helps too, but I just feel relaxed when I apply this oil and I did research on it that it helps with scars, pimples,etc. I love using this when I make Indian aztec healing clay.  The clay smells good and my skin feels great, relaxed.  I also add a few drops on hands and apply it to my hair for a wonderful smell. :)  I bought en empty bottle to mix this with jojoba oil to apply on entire face.  I saw it absorbs better mixed with carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Thank you for perfect service. I wanted to send a note of thanks to my sister who had done something wonderful when our aged mother had a setback. The gift arrived promptly and my sister used it right away. It was lovely that during a time of familial stress that all went so well and smoothly. little things count</li>
            <li> I mixed a few drops of this oil with water and spray it throughout the house; it leaves every room smelling wonderful and the fragrance remains for hours....it&#x27;s wonderfully soothing.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great for my home made laundry detergent! A few drops in a 4 gallon mix and it still packs a wonderful aroma!</li>
            <li> I love the properties of this oil and it is the go to oil of essential oils. This smells great.</li>
            <li> I purchased several for myself and one for a friend. This oil was very potent and fresh  enabling me to use sparingly! I am very happy with this line of oils!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Plant Therapy.  I use the lavender every night for the best sleep ever.  I have given this to each family member as a gift.  My kids use it for their children before bed or in baths.  They all love it as I do!</li>
            <li> High quality, no different to me than the Young Living oils and way cheaper! Smells great and pure with a good consistancy and works miracles to help with my insomnia combined with cedar and sandalwood oils rubbed on the bottom of my feet and big toe:) oh and I put 4 drops in some baking soda and use a sifter to sprinkle on all the mattresses onse a month and everyone, even my teenager sleeps so much more peacefully and go to sleep quicker!</li>
            <li> love this oil!!! I use it all the time and works great!!! I remember using it for an eye twitch and it went away!!! If you have no other oil in your arsenal, buy this one!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff-make my own cleaner with Borax and use this to put a nice fragrance to the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from plant therapy for years. I mix this with my face toner and it works perfectly. I put it behind my ears at bedtime. Not medicinal smelling, not overpowering, just awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help calm an anxious dog &amp; it worked great. I would heartily recommend it. Just put a drop or 2 on the bed &amp; collar.</li>
            <li> not as high quality as expected</li>
            <li> The order arrived on time and was well packed.  I put a few drops of the oil on my pillowcase as suggested by my doctor to help with a sleep issue.  Ithink it helps.</li>
            <li> I was having a tough time. i wanted to buy some EO but sellers for YL and DoTerra were just too expensive. I am happy with this oil and would recommend it to anyone who loves EO but not at the price the major companies are selling it for.</li>
            <li> The only reason for four stars and not five is I have not used it yet.  I plan on using my lavender oil as part of a recipe for natural insecticide inside the house as I&#x27;ve not only humans but indoor pets as well and do not want to use chemicals indoors.  I can say that the product was exactly what I purchased and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Great for oil burners, salt and sugar scrubs. I like to blend it with vanilla.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I would receive a box soaked in oil. To my amazement the package arrived undamaged and the contents were intact! Not a drop spilled. The packaging was very well done! Kudos to the one that packed that box! Good job! Very strong smelling, very concentrated, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I chose Plant Therapy when I asked my niece about Essential Oils, she said Plant Therapy was a Good Quality oil and the prices were reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is another oil that I purchased that isn&#x27;t one of the expensive ones but I love it in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> I got this to make bath salts for a baby shower. The bath salts were a hit at the shower! And now my kiddos have colds so I put a few drops in their bath to clear their sinus out. Definitely will order more</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product....You can use this product for many uses.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product and the sent...very relaxing to smell and wonderful for your skin.</li>
            <li> Got it for my sister as a gift and she loved it! She uses it to place in homemade laundry soap and carpet cleaner.</li>
            <li> the smell is wonderful</li>
            <li> great product, as expected, high quality, will do business again!</li>
            <li> Great...helps me fall asleep!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lavenders .. This is the one I keep buying over and over. It has the best smell.  I put a drop or two on my pillow at night to help sleep.. I put a few drops on a tissue when I travel and pack it with my clothes. I put it  anywhere I want to smell fabulous ....</li>
            <li> The product was simply not what I was looking for oil-wise, although it is a nice aroma.  Nothing wrong with the product, it just wasn&#x27;t the type of natural/essential oil I wanted.</li>
            <li> this items looks good ,smells good. I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it</li>
            <li> I just moved and lost both my collection of essential oils and the store I usually go to replace them. I ordered this off amazon because of the price. I didn&#x27;t have my hopes up for a high grade oil. However, I was very pleasantly surprised! I used it in a sugar scrub, and a few drops made the whole batch smell delicious without being over powering. I put it on my pillow a few nights a week and the smell is fresh, and not chemically like I expected. Works just as well as oil that costs over twice as much. I look forward to ordering more products from this line!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was hoping for - great scent and quality for less than any of the local retail stores in my area are charging. I use it for making my own spray (water, lavender oil and boiled lemon tea) as an anti-flea spray for my cats. it works extremely well. A little oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it. Feels like your at the spa. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice now and u will continue to order it as I run out.</li>
            <li> Great! This oil is definitely pure and good quality.I have purchased other oils from plant theraphy and I know I can trust the quality of their oils.Their oils smell the way the should smell and are the color they should be.Their oils cost a little little more than some of the brands that aren&#x27;t the best quality,but less than the known top brands (like trilogy )that are good in quality.I consider their oil the cheapest oils that are in their purest form.</li>
            <li> What can I say about lavender? A very pleasing odor when used in the house, a good scent for blander oils. good healing power.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate the scent of lavender, was not disappointed with my supply. Very well wrapped for shipping.  I just added .5oz to my soap and it was sufficient. Thank You.</li>
            <li> Very high quality. Just as described. Enjoy using it on a nightly basis to provide relaxation and sweet scents at home.</li>
            <li> Super product :) I used this scent to make homemade bath salts for teachers, co workers and friends as christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Love putting in my cold air humidifier.</li>
            <li> I ordered Lavender essential oil, product was as described and arrived on time.  I used for baths (with epsom salt) and for a yoga mat cleaning solution. Worked well.  Cheaper to buy the oil and create my own products.</li>
            <li> We bought this for an itch, that someone in the family has. It was suggested that Lavender helps the itching problem. It does. Excellent and natural.</li>
            <li> The Lavender Essential Oil is a quality product with excellent scent. It served my purpose - I make a hydrosol for personal use. The package arrived safely.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0069SQQ2I Lavender Essential Oil. 30 ml (1 oz). 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]</li>
            <li> As expected...a good lavendar scent at a good price!</li>
            <li> I put about two drops on my pillow when I feel difficult to fall asleep. It helps a lot. I thought it&#x27;s a little bit strong at first, but now it feels soothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Shark steam mop.  I just placed a few drops in with the water and it smelled so great while mopping.  My whole house still smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is just what I ordered. I like to wear at night time, and I also like to add to other oils I use, oils that don&#x27;t have any scent.  I can always count on Amazon for good service.</li>
            <li> Love love love this essential oil. Mix with fractionated coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I used this on my dog to help kill the fleas. It did a good job killing fleas and left my dog relaxed and smelling good. However, we found an even better option to kill fleas OVITROL PLUS. I still use the lavender diluted in water (just a few drops (2 or 3)  in 4oz of water) to keep my pup smelling great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than natures oils. We have used essential oils for 16 years and always, always benefit from them.&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils are a gift for humanity.&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy always provides excellent services too. Thank you once again.</li>
            <li> This product will be going in my daughter&#x27;s Christmas stocking as she uses the lavender essential oil mixed with vodka (you read that right) and water and puts it in a spray bottle for the best freshener (all natural) for her home.  Not sure where she got the recipe but she just loves the scent...</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful scent. It&#x27;s very fresh and sweet smelling and also very strong. I like it that way though. I use as a scented oil in my fragrance warmer every night to relax. It&#x27;s transporting. The price is amazing; I only wish they sold their products in larger sizes or had some recycling program for the cute little \\&quot;used\\&quot; bottles because I plan to keep buying a lot of them.</li>
            <li> It smells very little like Lavender! Also, I have very sensitive skin so it stings.&lt;br /&gt;I had to wash it off, and it left a rash.  The aroma is not good to use to cover bad&lt;br /&gt;odors ether.  I would not buy it again!</li>
            <li> Do not care for this product. I put it on my electric diffuser and it has a cheap, chemical smell. I had to turn the diffuser off and turn the fan on to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> Great quality oil--definitely enjoying it (especially on stressful days)!  Will consider this company for future orders of homeopathic and essential oils:-)</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite prepared for how strong the &amp;#34;undiluted&amp;#34; scent would be.  I used it only once and now its sitting in my medicine cabinet until I find something else I can do with it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again, this lavender is exceptional. Smells divine. I believe my skin has improved from use of this morning and night. Plant therapy seems to be a great company for essential oils, im very impressed, also with there customer service.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in March but didn&#x27;t open it until today to find that the bottle was COMPLETELY EMPTY.  Basically I paid $10 for a small glass bottle with nothing in it.  It was too late to return this item because the &#x27;return window&#x27; has closed.  I don&#x27;t think the liquid dried up because the inside is bone dry and doesn&#x27;t even smell like lavender. I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lavander essential oils from Aveda and they smell nothing like this one. I use it at bed time (on pillows) for my kids or in their bath. One droop is all you need to refresh an entire room. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I actually got this for leg cramps which does wonders, but just a drop anywhere amazes me how long the smell stays with you</li>
            <li> Using this oil in my diffuser, in my homemade lotion and in homemade bath salts, I clearly adore this oil.  It smells divine.  Always ships and arrives quickly and is packaged well.  I keep it in my work bag knowing it&#x27;s safe because it arrives in a bubble wrap pocket with an opening to slide it in and out so I just keep it in that pocket.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.many usages and arrived quickly as expected.thank you.</li>
            <li> This oil is very calming and has even helped with my allergies. I LOVE the Plant Therapy brand, quality oils at a fraction of the cost of competition!</li>
            <li> I love this lavender oil. I use it in the bath, homemade scrubs and all kinds of other things its awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to make homemade dryer sheets.  I also put a few drops in unscented handsoap and it smells so good.  I will definitely be finding places to use this oil!</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last when sprinkled on items. Great for just inhaling from the bottle though. Received it quickly.</li>
            <li> I got the lavender essential oil to use in moth repellant sachets.  Don&#x27;t know if it works yet but it&#x27;s strong and smells good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve begun a project creating lavender bath salts and required Lavender Essential Oil. The product was priced well, arrived on time and it&#x27;s made its way into these amazing bath salts that I&#x27;m putting together for family and friends. The aroma is heavenly. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this, it&#x27;s a very relaxing scent to have around.  First time buying any type of essential oil and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the aroma of the Lavender.  I thought it would smell more floral.  It smells like some kind of antiseptic!</li>
            <li> Loved this lavender oil. Very fragrant and a true lavender smell. I have really enjoyed it. I use it for relaxation and cleaning purposes.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of lavender.  The scent of this oil seems so pure and transports me to a field of flowers.  I use it in my bath and I also use it to make an insect repellant.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this for moth protection for my wool products.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good, plus I like the smell as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this to add to my homemade carpet refresher and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it! I even add it to my oil Burner to make my house smell great</li>
            <li> i used the oil. it smells good and it was a good price. i will order it again. im a massage therapist and i use it in my practice.</li>
            <li> I just started out with soap making and wanted some lavender essential oil. The oil arrived promptly and was well packaged. My only problem is the price. If you are looking for essential oils, check out Bramble Berry.</li>
            <li> I wanted to add some lovely Lavender scent to my homemade spray starch.  This worked out great.  It doesn&#x27;t take much so this bottle will last a long time.  I&#x27;ll be buying more of it though when its gone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use in my nursery to help my baby sleep better. It is a high quality oil that has a lovely aroma.</li>
            <li> This is a potent essential oil and it is going to serve my purposes extremely well...I will mix and use as a spray for my dogs coat and bedding.  She is slightly OCD and this is soothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even tho this is slightly mentholated that isn&#x27;t a deterrent as far as I am concerned&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this oil for what ever you need</li>
            <li> I like this oil and it&#x27;s many uses. They say, &amp;#34;when in doubt use lavender&amp;#34; &amp; I completely agree. This is a good quality oil.</li>
            <li> i use this is the humidifer in my  office with some drops of this in the water.  The smell is amazing.  this would be lovely used in a bathroom or a bedroom.  very relaxing.  arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Let me honestly admit I can not stand the smell of lavender. I purchased it out of necessity; not out of desire. Product arrived days ahead of delivery date, which is good. Product was sealed &amp; wrapped well to prevent leakage as well as having plastic safety seal on lid. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using therapeutic grade essential lavender oil for years. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered from this company and I&#x27;ll say that all my expectations were met. The only thing, and this isn&#x27;t really a complaint, is that I prefer my lavender oil to not have a &#x27;menthol&#x27; scent which is why I typically order lavender Vera or french lavender essential oil. However,it&#x27;s a personal preference because some think the &#x27;menthol&#x27; scent is refreshing/clean. Having said that, I&#x27;m overall very satisified with my purchase and will try some of the other oils. This product is really theraputic grade. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Everything was great...was as advertised, came on time and I love it. I would recommend it and order it again.</li>
            <li> Arrived just as expected. Very strong scent--one drop is more than enough to dab behind your ears or on your pillow case if you&#x27;re use using to help fall asleep (although, haven&#x27;t had any luck in that department using this, unfortunately).</li>
            <li> I got this instead of Young Living and the product smells and works just great.  I&#x27;ve made Lavender Lemon Peppermint for the allergies and it seems to help.</li>
            <li> I like the smell - hoping that it would have scented the laundry, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.  Maybe I am doing it wrong.  Nice to have for the bath, etc.!</li>
            <li> Delivery was on timely fashion, and little goes a long long way! I bought this product with plan of making home-made lotion in mind. I&#x27;m pleased with this product overall.</li>
            <li> Good lavender scent! Different brands to have different lavender scents, this one I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product for an amazing price. Much cheaper than at the health food store. Completely satisfied with item. Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I just used it in one of my products, and it seemed to work just as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Shipped quickly.  Kind of pricey.</li>
            <li> The product is how it is described.  If Pure and Undiluted Lavender Essdential Oil is what you are looking for, than this is the  destination.  It was my first time to use Lavender Oil and I couldn&#x27;t find many uses for it plus I didn&#x27;t turned out be a big fond of its aroma. But this product is perfect for those who Like Lavender Oil and know how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was on time. and the bottle was securely packaged.</li>
            <li> I always feel best when I am wearing lavender oil, and the more concentrated the better. I can&#x27;t afford the concentrated French version these days, so I ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is good; it doesn&#x27;t smell fake or cheap like other inexpensive oils have. To me, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like, but personally, I want to smell it on myself all the time, because it keeps me in a stable mood.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you want to spend over $30.00 for a tiny bottle, I would say this one is second best.</li>
            <li> I bought this to prevent my dog from licking and scratching her front paw. It did not work and she smelled horrible. Lavender has a very strong scent which no one in my home liked. I would never buy this again, it is expensive and worthless.</li>
            <li> These pure oils are great. My first purchases of the pure oils for use for my bedding, my sons, and for bath time. great products that the whole family loves.</li>
            <li> I love the smell in my beroom.....promotes restful sleep.  Promotes relaxation to allow me to get to sleep sooner. Besides it lingers all day.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. It does what it says.  Has many uses. I always buy this brand- a very good product.</li>
            <li> Great product smells clean and very potent only use one drop! Not much of a floral lavender scent. I use for aromatherapy and relaxation. Im a newcomer to essential oils and havent used for much beyond bathtime and on my pillow.</li>
            <li> I am using the Lavender oil in my Plant Therapy aromatherapy nebulizer at night to help with sleep.  I have been falling asleep quickly and with fewer wake ups.</li>
            <li> I use this on my toe nails to prevent and get rid of nail fungus.  I know, gross.  I never had nail fungus until I stubbed my toe really badly last year and it slowly grew under the nail bed.  I know, gross.  I had ordered this lavender essential oil previously to scent my towels (works great for that, too)...then I researched at home toenail fungus remedies and was delighted that this worked.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of lavender essential oil.  I was having issues with ingrown hairs and my esthetician said this would help and she was right.  I put a little on my trouble areas a few times a week and haven&#x27;t had anymore problems.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several different types of oils and I am very happy with all of them.  They have been really effective for each specific reason that were to be used. Lavender is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> For a Lavendar oil, this has the distinct back of a musky wood.  It&#x27;s not intolerable, but it&#x27;s not really true lavender either.  Doesn&#x27;t change the fact that when it&#x27;s mixed with a little vanilla or lemon, it smells delicious.  I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help with flea control, but when the bottle arrived it was empty.  Not even a faint whiff of lavender when I opened it.  Not too great when I had counted on having it.  I&#x27;m sure this was a manufacturing error, but doesn&#x27;t help me too much.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good. I give it 4 stars because the dropper is hard to use and to measure the number of drops that are being used. It either comes out not at all or too fast. Overall it made my shampoo and conditioner smell wonderful and help out the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into essential oils for personal care and had lavender recommended by a couple of knowledgeable friends.  This bottle seems a little more peppery than other lavenders I&#x27;ve smelled, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  I like that it comes packed in bubble wrap to protect it, but the box it came in was ridiculously huge and kind of wasteful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for mixing with alcohol and tea tree oil to create spray to freshen carpet in my office. It helps to remove the odor on the carpet and odor in the air temporarily. The Lavender oil itself is great quality and I&#x27;ve used it even on my jojoba oil and tea tree oil mix for aiding acne on my skin face in the past.</li>
            <li> I love lavendar and essential oil on front and back of palm while I work is heaven. When I relax I inhale inside of palm deeply and its euphoric. It&#x27;s a wonderful stress reliever while typing and even better when relaxing. I mix with lemon grass for an uplifting inhale.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a relative.  She has no complaints.  Service was prompt.  I didn&#x27;t use it myself, so I won&#x27;t give the 5 stars as I&#x27;m not sure how it measures up to my regular brand.</li>
            <li> This is great in a warm vibrating foot bath with epsom salt on a cold night; Very relaxing for us.</li>
            <li> this item is completely overpriced, I realized it after I had bought it already - you can buy a 2 oz bottle (that is 6 times as much content) for $ 12.50 from Now on Amazon. This small bottle only contains 1/3 of an ounce!!!  In case you are saying: yes, but it&#x27;s not therapeutic, this is what I found out about the meaning of therapeutic: Therapeutic Grade\\&quot; in this country, the term is meaningless, and often used as just marketing hype.  Any vendor can claim that their oils are \\&quot;Therapeutic Grade\\&quot; since there is no definition of the term.&lt;br /&gt;I learned my lesson, I will research better next time, before I buy!</li>
            <li> The most useful essential oil.  It smells so good I want it all the time, along with my favorite patchouli!</li>
            <li> I brought the lavender essential oil as part of my daily hair grooming routine. I have really dry scalp and I have been mixing the lavender oil with Jojoba oil. I feel like there has been improvement in my scalp so, so far so good. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly! Used it to make lotion bars and everyone loved them and the lavender scent.  A little bit goes a long way. I used 25 drops to about one cup of ingredients and it was more than enough to scent the product.</li>
            <li> This works great to mix in coconut and hemp oils this helps with a pleasant odor and the benefits of lavender .this gives the oil a pleasant odor .</li>
            <li> i do love the scent of fresh lavendar, but i was very dissapointed with this product. its way too strong for me personally.and it didnt have that beautifull aroma of fresh lilac it was a a terrible scent. i would not recommend this to anyone, im sorry, but you need to know.im here to edit my own personal experience with this lilac oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair. It works great. I heard it helps It grow. Seller was great too. I hope it grows my hair!</li>
            <li> I use this to help set the mood for biofeedback stress reduction meditation. The aroma is pure, soothing and strong.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, great smell, fast and friendly service.  Purchased three different oils from Plant Therapy and liked them so I purchased more. Use the oils with a plugin diffuser.</li>
            <li> It smells like it is supposed to so that&#x27;s great so I would definitely buy it again. I like it</li>
            <li> I use this oil every night before bed.  It smells great and seems to be very good quality.  And the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I found the quality of this to be just as good as some of the more expensive essential oils. I use this for a lot of things such as a room deodorizer, mosquito repellent, bug bite salve and for relaxation. My husband and daughter call it my witch brew and even made fun of me for it. Until I used it on him for some really bad bug bites (with tea tree oil). He woke up the next day and his bug bites were gone.</li>
            <li> I used it to make a body scrub for Christmas gifts and it smelled great! I plan on using it w/witch hazel as a toner for my face too.</li>
            <li> Great value. Just as advertised. Great shipping time.</li>
            <li> I use it to grow my hair. It made my air so shinny and healthy. So glad I bought this oil.</li>
            <li> Authentic lavender scent.  I use it by soaking cotton balls and placing them in my clothes closet.  I do not  have any ventilation in my closet, so this scent helps keep the mustiness out of my clothes.  I must keep both summer and winter clothes in my closet, so this means a lot of clothes and coats.  I also like the faint scent that settles on my clothes.  Since I do not wear any perfume or scented cosmetics, there is no conflict of &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, arrived quickly and well packaged.  I use this natural product in moisturizer and it is great.</li>
            <li> Nice for my shampoo, etc</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the smell. The house has very good smell to it and it makes me feel at home . I have a pet and you would not even know it.People comment how how good the smell is. Better than all those aerosole sprays.</li>
            <li> Smelled terriffic!!!  I used this to make Lavendar bathsalts as a baby shower favor gift.  Everyone loved the smell and I am so happy they turned out so well.</li>
            <li> I loved the oils I received and will recommend to friends and family. I received my merchandise very quickly without much delay.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve used it on my pillows, my clothing, and in my bath for stress reduction.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> Prompt service and the product was exactly as it was described, I would order again from this company.  This was my first time ordering this type of product online, but I plan to try the other essential oils also.</li>
            <li> I love this oil and use it in a rub I make for pain relief.</li>
            <li> some lavender&#x27;s can have the fake smell to it, these however do not. quick delivery. I use it directly on my skin and in bath water</li>
            <li> I use this in my yoga classes, I pour a little on a towel and then wave the towel over students in shavasana.  This is a light, clean lavender smell.  The bottle is designed to only dispense a drop or two at a time, which is perfect, because you could quickly over do this.  There&#x27;s a sticker on top of the bottle marking the smell, that helps with organizing.</li>
            <li> I combined several drops of this Lavendar Essential Oil and several drops of the Orange Essential Oil from the same company in a spray bottle with water and started misting the area around a piece of furniture on which one of my older cats had started urinating on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing this for about a week and there have been no further occurences of this behavior, what a fantastic fix to a problem that has been very aggravating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t guarantee that it would work for all cats but it has been a great fix with mine for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Essential oils make my baths feel awesome! I would recommend this product for anyone out there.</li>
            <li> I love this bottle of lavender essential oil! It has a plastic thing on the bottle so that it comes out as drops and so that it doesn&#x27;t pour out. Which I love! It&#x27;s an excellent product and I use it for so many things! Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product to buy if you are just getting into essential oils. Was delivered fast and smells great. However, be careful because the drops come out really fast since there is no dropper included - that&#x27;s the only thing I could say, is that I wish these bottle had droppers. When they say use one drop, use ONE drop! This stuff is very strong but nice if used correctly!</li>
            <li> My wife uses a few drops of lavender essential oil in her bath to help her relax.  The product is everything they claim it to be.  We will be re-odering again when this supply is used up.</li>
            <li> I bought the lavender oil because I had read it&#x27;s good for sleeping. Maybe it&#x27;s just a coincidence but since I have started putting a few drops on my pillows, I&#x27;ve had some of the best night sleeps in a long time! I&#x27;ve been up early (and I am NOT a morning person) and within minutes of my head hitting the pillow, I&#x27;m asleep. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this essential oil to add to my collection and to use it in my homemade beauty products.  It has a pleasant smell and you get a lot for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the item yet, but, the shipping was very fast, the price was right, and, I believe this will be great for it&#x27;s intended use.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing essential oils. I bought the lavender to use in my homemade body butter and homemade deodorant. This seems potent, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> The oil works as it should.  The bottle has a built in dropper so the liquid comes out slowly.  I have not taken out the dropper but it does look like it can be removed.</li>
            <li> Really great quality essential oil I am very pleased with my purchase. I will definately be using more of this companies products.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in secure packaging so that the glass bottle was adequately protected. The lavender oil smells great!  It&#x27;s exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing  essential oil but it will not be my last. I had this to my bath and relax into lavender heaven.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys the soothing scent of lavender.  A couple of drops om my bed sheets helps me sleep very well.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer of this product. Works well with lavender oil for acne, blemishes dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing happens overnight so dont expect a quick result. Like the old folks say \\&quot;patience is virtue\\&quot; and i am definately going to buy more when this one finishes. I am telling everyone i know about it who is suffering with acne problems. Mix mines with olive oil and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Works better than those products in the store</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a holistic doctor for evening baths.  I decided to use this and accidentally overused it on my first time (there is no detachable dropper so count the drops that come out!).  It has a very strong aroma but once I got the dosage down, it was very pleasant!</li>
            <li> Used product in detox cleansing bath recommended by Doctor OZ.  Works wonderfully and leaves the body feeling like a new one!</li>
            <li> Exactly what the wife was looking great for our daughters baths, just a few drops and she loves the aroma.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the lavender essential oil!  My family loves it.  It is great when mixed with a warm bath--super relaxing right before bedtime!</li>
            <li> Love the laendar drops put them in my bath and a few drops on my pillow, such a relaxing and wonderful lavendar smell.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and relieves pain!!! Good product!</li>
            <li> Loved this product so much!  Too much actually, because it is gone already and I need to order more!  Great smell, good quality!  Would, and will, definately reorder!!</li>
