            <li>Literally my favorite perfume in life.</li>
            <li>I have stated before how I love the looks of perfume bottles</li>
            <li>and I love the top to this one&lt;br /&gt;the scent</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this BCBG Max</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This sent is now aded in my list if top 5 perfumes.</li>
            <li>delivery was time mannerly</li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments.</li>
            <li>The smell is sexy..</li>
            <li>I also love the bottle.</li>
            <li>She loves the creative bottle that it comes in.</li>
            <li>I honestly was really excited about finding this product.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it so much I ordered one for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overwhelming scent, light and fruity, and holds up well, with my getting an easy 6-8 hours of wear out of it.</li>
            <li>she said she liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the way it smells on me - sweet, but not too sweet!</li>
            <li>WOW this stuff smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>If you like a sweet not too over powering smell you will love this.</li>
            <li>Saw it on amazon.com and figured the price was worth the risk; we all know those ads smell SO much better than the bottle</li>
            <li>but I have to say that I really enjoy this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Light</li>
            <li>Feminine and light but not too light.</li>
            <li>BCBG has a fabulous ad&#x27; campaign with fold outs/peel backs for sampling</li>
            <li>I love candy/fruity scents and this was right up my alley.</li>
            <li>Was so excited to come across at such a great price.</li>
            <li>New favorite for my style of fragrance!</li>
            <li>Every time I wear it people compliment me through out the day its so worth it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a sweet, fruity scent with musky undertones and a touch of floral.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a sickeningly sweet scent as it&#x27;s tempered by the musk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>alittle sweet</li>
            <li>The fruity quality is the predominant note causing me to give this sweet disapointment a 2 star rating.</li>
            <li>exact same kind I wanted!</li>
            <li>based summer scent filled with fruit and florals without smelling too sweet, lasts a nice long time (I can still smell it on me at the end of a work day), and the bottle is really pretty on my bureau!</li>
            <li>Smells fairly strong at first but mellows out very fast.</li>
            <li>It was the real deal!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li>The price was great and it was delivered in a few days.</li>
            <li>The packageing and bottle looks elegant and classy.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all of the max azria perfumes and this one is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, the scent barely lasts an hour.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I smelled it in a magazine ad first.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this perfume that I ordered a second bottle.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that Ive purchased a fragrance based on reviews and reading the notes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I actually like this fragrance better than my Burberry Brit or Jimmy Choo</li>
            <li>Arrived in one piece and ready to go!</li>
            <li>The bottle is so pretty.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first perfumes I&#x27;ve ever purchased based solely on reviews.</li>
            <li>I bought this exact perfume in Miami BeachFlorida at the BCBG store on Lincoln Rd..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean soft feminine smell.</li>
            <li>Not bad for someone starting to get into perfume, unless you don&#x27;t like sweet scents.</li>
            <li>but I never smelled the real perfume</li>
            <li>thanks for the affordable price</li>
            <li>they came so fast and they are originals.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to pay that much for it.</li>
            <li>Very floral and feminine.</li>
            <li>Smells very feminine.</li>
            <li>This eau de parfum seems to last, but it is not as good as BCBG Max Azria that has a pink cover.</li>
            <li>Smells okay, but really reminds me of that cheap perfume I used to buy when I was like 10 years old that was sold by the register in stores at the mall for like $5 :-/</li>
            <li>but I have gotten many compliments from other girls who tell me they like it.</li>
            <li>Whereas the ad&#x27;s scent has a slight fruity sweetness and the predominant quality is the more woodsy note; this is \\&quot;not so\\&quot; from the bottle I ordered.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s new fragrance, Bon Chic.  </li>
            <li>One of my new favorite perfumes and I have been wearing it almost everyday!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance smells good, but it seems to smell a little different than the same perfume I bought at a retail store.</li>
            <li>This is my first and last time ordering perfume from Amazon.....</li>
            <li>looked up the fragrance notes and they read as follows: &amp;#34;The scent, more sensual and sweeter than its predecessor, opens with ultra fruity wave of black raspberry, mango and Asian pear.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d never actually smelled it.)I really like Vince Camuto&#x27;s original parfum spray, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me</li>
            <li>Soft smell, a lot of complements, I adore</li>
            <li>My husband surprised me with this perfume.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for someone and that person loved it,  no complaints and the smell doesn&#x27;t go away like the fake ones</li>
            <li>but apparently they don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;If looking for a more subtle scent, then I recommend their other product:</li>
            <li>I bought a tiny little sample of this a year ago and I bought the real thing now.</li>

            <li> delivery was time mannerly</li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments.</li>
            <li> The smell is sexy..</li>
            <li> I also love the bottle.</li>
            <li> She loves the creative bottle that it comes in.</li>
            <li> I honestly was really excited about finding this product.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it so much I ordered one for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overwhelming scent, light and fruity, and holds up well, with my getting an easy 6-8 hours of wear out of it.</li>
            <li> she said she liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the way it smells on me - sweet, but not too sweet!</li>
            <li> WOW this stuff smells amazing!  </li>
            <li> If you like a sweet not too over powering smell you will love this.</li>
            <li> Saw it on amazon.com and figured the price was worth the risk; we all know those ads smell SO much better than the bottle</li>
            <li> but I have to say that I really enjoy this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Light</li>
            <li> Feminine and light but not too light.</li>
            <li> BCBG has a fabulous ad&#x27; campaign with fold outs/peel backs for sampling</li>
            <li> I love candy/fruity scents and this was right up my alley.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to come across at such a great price.</li>
            <li> New favorite for my style of fragrance!</li>
            <li> Every time I wear it people compliment me through out the day its so worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a sweet, fruity scent with musky undertones and a touch of floral.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a sickeningly sweet scent as it&#x27;s tempered by the musk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> alittle sweet</li>
            <li> The fruity quality is the predominant note causing me to give this sweet disapointment a 2 star rating.</li>
            <li> exact same kind I wanted!</li>
            <li> based summer scent filled with fruit and florals without smelling too sweet, lasts a nice long time (I can still smell it on me at the end of a work day), and the bottle is really pretty on my bureau!</li>
            <li> Smells fairly strong at first but mellows out very fast.</li>
            <li> It was the real deal!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> The price was great and it was delivered in a few days.</li>
            <li> The packageing and bottle looks elegant and classy.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all of the max azria perfumes and this one is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, the scent barely lasts an hour.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I smelled it in a magazine ad first.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this perfume that I ordered a second bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that Ive purchased a fragrance based on reviews and reading the notes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I actually like this fragrance better than my Burberry Brit or Jimmy Choo</li>
            <li> Arrived in one piece and ready to go!</li>
            <li> The bottle is so pretty.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first perfumes I&#x27;ve ever purchased based solely on reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact perfume in Miami BeachFlorida at the BCBG store on Lincoln Rd..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean soft feminine smell.</li>
            <li> Not bad for someone starting to get into perfume, unless you don&#x27;t like sweet scents.</li>
            <li> but I never smelled the real perfume</li>
            <li> thanks for the affordable price</li>
            <li> they came so fast and they are originals.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want to pay that much for it.</li>
            <li> Very floral and feminine.</li>
            <li> Smells very feminine.</li>
            <li> This eau de parfum seems to last, but it is not as good as BCBG Max Azria that has a pink cover.</li>
            <li> Smells okay, but really reminds me of that cheap perfume I used to buy when I was like 10 years old that was sold by the register in stores at the mall for like $5 :-/</li>
            <li> but I have gotten many compliments from other girls who tell me they like it.</li>
            <li> Whereas the ad&#x27;s scent has a slight fruity sweetness and the predominant quality is the more woodsy note; this is \\&quot;not so\\&quot; from the bottle I ordered.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s new fragrance, Bon Chic.  </li>
            <li> One of my new favorite perfumes and I have been wearing it almost everyday!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance smells good, but it seems to smell a little different than the same perfume I bought at a retail store.</li>
            <li> This is my first and last time ordering perfume from Amazon.....</li>
            <li> looked up the fragrance notes and they read as follows: &amp;#34;The scent, more sensual and sweeter than its predecessor, opens with ultra fruity wave of black raspberry, mango and Asian pear.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d never actually smelled it.)I really like Vince Camuto&#x27;s original parfum spray, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me</li>
            <li> Soft smell, a lot of complements, I adore</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with this perfume.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone and that person loved it,  no complaints and the smell doesn&#x27;t go away like the fake ones</li>
            <li> but apparently they don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;If looking for a more subtle scent, then I recommend their other product:</li>
            <li> I bought a tiny little sample of this a year ago and I bought the real thing now.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone looking for a professional yet slightly sultry</li>
            <li> Luxurious notes are combined with the highest quality ingredients with black raspberry, violet, soft woods and cashmere musk.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I feel this bottle is not an original, that it&#x27;s one of those fakes made to look authentic.</li>
            <li> I opened the box, and the first thing I noticed that the lid is quite heavy for the bottle, it falls over if I don&#x27;t set it down</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who likes soft, floral scents with a little bit of sweetness.</li>
            <li> so I was looking at other perfumes that had similar notes.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this lasted on me for 3-4hrs;</li>
            <li> The black raspberry and violet are definitely the top notes with soft woods and cashmere musk as the base notes.</li>
            <li> The heart is floral with notes of pink peony, violet and orange blossom.</li>
            <li> , she just had to get the Pink bottle too.</li>
            <li> The base is soft and warm, made of soft woods, vanilla and cashmere musk.&amp;#34; That soft woods/vanilla/cashmere musk is what makes it last on my skin and the base note I look for knowing it works well on</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve stated in my other Eau de Parfum reviews, I am not a fan of musky smells.</li>
            <li> Half the cost as other stores.</li>
            <li> I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> It is too sweet for me :((((((</li>
            <li> Bought a little one at Kohls 1st ($$$$!</li>
            <li> Shipped a little slow</li>
            <li> There are some negative reviews out there</li>
            <li> Just hate how big the cap is...</li>
            <li> gave a big whiff in and, uh, is this mosquito repellent??</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t go wrong here.  </li>
            <li> Mad</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells okay, but really reminds me of that cheap perfume I used to buy when I was like 10 years old that was sold by the register in stores at the mall for like $5 :-/ Have a feeling it&#x27;s a knockoff but I never smelled the real perfume so I can&#x27;t be sure. On top of that, the scent barely lasts an hour. Mad I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had recently smelled this perfume in a magazine and suggested I check it out.  Upon receiving this perfume I can&#x27;t help but wear it all the time it smells so good.  Glad he suggested that I get this product.</li>
            <li> love this perfume its beautiful</li>
            <li> Lovely scent.  Good price.</li>
            <li> lovely scent, great price</li>
            <li> Bought a little one at Kohls 1st ($$$$! Even a t -30%!)  LOVED IT. So looked on Amazon and of course amazing pricing! Shipped a little slow but I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry. This is a very sophisticated scent, not too flowery or too sweet and not &amp;#34;Old lady ish&amp;#34; Very nice !!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was the real deal!! Not faux!  I love it and I receive plenty of kind compliments when I wear it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I feel this bottle is not an original, that it&#x27;s one of those fakes made to look authentic.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Bought as a gift  for the wife.</li>
            <li> I love this scent!! I got it fast and at a great price...couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> I really love this ultra-feminine, sensual scent. I smelled it in a magazine ad first. Saw it on amazon.com and figured the price was worth the risk; we all know those ads smell SO much better than the bottle usually!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sweet, fruity scent with musky undertones and a touch of floral. The fruit scent is a pear/berry kinda smell, I think it might have neroli as the flower?  It isn&#x27;t a sickeningly sweet scent as it&#x27;s tempered by the musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up the fragrance notes and they read as follows: &amp;#34;The scent, more sensual and sweeter than its predecessor, opens with ultra fruity wave of black raspberry, mango and Asian pear. The heart is floral with notes of pink peony, violet and orange blossom. The base is soft and warm, made of soft woods, vanilla and cashmere musk.&amp;#34; That soft woods/vanilla/cashmere musk is what makes it last on my skin and the base note I look for knowing it works well on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - a musk based summer scent filled with fruit and florals without smelling too sweet, lasts a nice long time (I can still smell it on me at the end of a work day), and the bottle is really pretty on my bureau! ;)</li>
            <li> Smells so good, but the scent dissipate by mid-morning. I which the scent would last all day.</li>
            <li> I love it ! Every time I wear it I get hella compliments ðŸ˜Š smells delightful</li>
            <li> Gorgeous bottle and smells sweet but not over powering the price point was awesome! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this perfume that I ordered a second bottle. I wear this as my day to day scent--its light and perfect for summer. If you like feminine scents that aren&#x27;t too flowery, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li> I bought a tiny little sample of this a year ago and I bought the real thing now. My husband loves this smell on me and I always get complimented on my scent!</li>
            <li> I looked all over the Caribbean for this parfum, and could not find it. I came home and went on to Amazon and there it was I purchased one for myself. After I tried it I immediately knew my daughter would love it so I purchased another bottle for her as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!! Shipping was very fast. I received my order in about 4  days (including the weekend). This is the first time that Ive purchased a fragrance based on reviews and reading the notes. This does not disappoint!!! I love candy/fruity scents and this was right up my alley. The scent is like warm candy with with a hint of florals. Sorry, im sure I didnt do it any justice. Highly recommend it!! Prada Candy and Escada Turquiose Summer are next on my hit list....</li>
            <li> Smells really good:) such a great gift</li>
            <li> Soft smell, a lot of complements, I adore</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this fragrance and its a great price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does not smell like the one I bought out the store and the bottle does not look the same....  It smells just like alcohol to me and it does not last....  Very disappointed and I can&#x27;t even return it.... This is my first and last time ordering perfume from Amazon.....</li>
            <li> love it  very nice fragrance will buy this over and over. thanks for the affordable price</li>
            <li> Smells so good. I love it. It is a great spring/summer scent.</li>
            <li> Great , Up to standards !!</li>
            <li> Smells so wonderful â™¡</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fragrance but it it seems to wear off by mid day. I have to say it does last longer than a lot of the more expensive fragrances I have worn. I think it is a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Get tons of compliments. Just hate how big the cap is... I like to carry with me in my bag.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent!  Love this!</li>
            <li> Bought one for my myself and I loved it so much I ordered one for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it as well. Looked for this while on a cruise in November no one in the Caribbean has it. Came home and looked on Amazon there it was.</li>
            <li> Try to smell it in the store before you get it just to make sure you like it but I have gotten many compliments from other girls who tell me they like it.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Was so excited to come across at such a great price. Gorgeous light scent, would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> The 1st time I smelled this fragrance in a magazine I knew I had to have it. It&#x27;s a sexy, feminine fragrance that ALWAYS gets compliments from both men and women. This is my 2nd bottle and I&#x27;m still in love! It&#x27;s now my signature fragrance and I&#x27;m so happy I can find it on Amazon.com at such a great price!</li>
            <li> I was looking through a magazine when I came across this scent and just fell in love with it . The price was great . Half the cost as other stores.</li>
            <li> My fav perfume of all time I ordered 2 they came so fast and they are originals. Love. Love. Love!</li>
            <li> i gave this perfume to my daughter elisa  for a passover gift.  she said she liked it very much.  it has a nice light aroma.</li>
            <li> It was not shipped until more than a week after I placed my order, but it is understandable given the holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;However, it was delivered in just one day after I received my confirmation e-mail saying it was shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product, and I can still smell the fragrance even after 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a professional yet slightly sultry scent.&lt;br /&gt;If looking for a more subtle scent, then I recommend their other product: Bcbg Max Azria Eau De Parfum Spray for Women.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Bon Chic at Perfumania but apparently they don&#x27;t carry it. Macy&#x27;s had it in different sizes ranging from $50-80. I didn&#x27;t really want to pay that much for it. Lo and behold I go on Amazon and find it for $20!! What a bargain! What can you not find on Amazon??!!! The perfume has a gorgeous scent. I love it! Very floral and feminine.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother in law and she just can&#x27;t thank me enough she loves the scent and the bottle&#x27;s presentation, she just had to get the Pink bottle too.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine ad and I loved it so much so I took a chance and ordered a bottle. There are some negative reviews out there but I have to say that I really enjoy this fragrance. It&#x27;s a mixture of floral with a touch of fruitiness to it. It&#x27;s not overpowering and it lasts for a while on your skin. I would recommend it to anyone who likes soft, floral scents with a little bit of sweetness.</li>
            <li> Literally my favorite perfume in life. Its my signature &#x27;me&#x27; smell.</li>
            <li> I have stated before how I love the looks of perfume bottles and I love the top to this one&lt;br /&gt;the scent is great I love the smell of this BCBG Max</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift last year and I love it. I always receive compliments when I wear this perfume</li>
            <li> Great price for great scent. Light</li>
            <li> This eau de parfum seems to last, but it is not as good as BCBG Max Azria that has a pink cover.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift. She loved it</li>
            <li> It is too sweet for me :((((((</li>
            <li> Smelled this in a magazine insert, researched it, and Amazon had the best price hands down, and it was the large size, #winning!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone and that person loved it,  no complaints and the smell doesn&#x27;t go away like the fake ones</li>
            <li> Smells great, the best price I could find, larger bottle than what I found at Khols and I &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> WOW this stuff smells amazing!  One of my new favorite perfumes and I have been wearing it almost everyday!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Omg! Love this scent! It&#x27;s a clean soft feminine smell. I actually like this fragrance better than my Burberry Brit or Jimmy Choo and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper. New favorite for my style of fragrance!</li>
            <li> Great size for the prize! Arrived in one piece and ready to go!</li>
            <li> Smells very feminine. I feel so sexy, and beautiful when I wear it. The packageing and bottle looks elegant and classy.  I made a wonderful choice. This sent is now aded in my list if top 5 perfumes.</li>
            <li> It has very nice packaging. Smells fairly strong at first but mellows out very fast. I have dry skin and this lasted on me for 3-4hrs; wished it would last longer. But you can still smell hints of it as it fades away  Has a sweet fruity scent with a hint of floral, very nice for spring. Not bad for someone starting to get into perfume, unless you don&#x27;t like sweet scents. Would definitely buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Smell so good that can not stop swear and delivery was time mannerly</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent, lots of compliments. The bottle is so pretty.</li>
            <li> Anytime I see this fragrance...I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase...one of my favorites</li>
            <li> great scent I feel in love with when I was given a free sample at a beauty shop. Great size!</li>
            <li> This is one if the best perfumes out there. Every time I wear it people compliment me through out the day its so worth it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the first perfumes I&#x27;ve ever purchased based solely on reviews. (I&#x27;d never actually smelled it.)I really like Vince Camuto&#x27;s original parfum spray, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me so I was looking at other perfumes that had similar notes. I am thrilled with this! I get compliments all the time (from men and women)and I LOVE the way it smells on me - sweet, but not too sweet!</li>
            <li> Simply wonderful. Scent is just spectacular!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!  I receive so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Feminine and light but not too light. Many compliments!!!</li>
            <li> The fragrance smells good, but it seems to smell a little different than the same perfume I bought at a retail store.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact perfume in Miami BeachFlorida at the BCBG store on Lincoln Rd..It was on sale for $80..I smelled it &amp; fell in love! The smell is sexy..alittle sweet..just great! Was kind if pricey but I still bought it..then of course it ran out &amp; I&#x27;m living in Chicago now so I looked on Amazon for it! Found it for a great price but had never bought anything from amazon so I was skeptical! But it arrived with in a week..exact same kind I wanted! Perfect..</li>
            <li> This was a surprise gift and I love it! Luxurious notes are combined with the highest quality ingredients with black raspberry, violet, soft woods and cashmere musk. As I&#x27;ve stated in my other Eau de Parfum reviews, I am not a fan of musky smells. The black raspberry and violet are definitely the top notes with soft woods and cashmere musk as the base notes. It&#x27;s not an overwhelming scent, light and fruity, and holds up well, with my getting an easy 6-8 hours of wear out of it. I am very happy with my new scent! It is now in my top 3 rotation!</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with this perfume. I am impressed not only that he bought it, but that the fragrance is exceptional. I also love the bottle. Looks nice on my dresser in the bedroom. And this perfume has an excellent, not over powering, not fruity, nor synthetic mix, but a fragrance that I can use for those special occasions.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the max azria perfumes and this one is my favorite by far. It smells so good and I&#x27;m always getting compliments from both women and men asking what sent I&#x27;m wearing. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. If you like a sweet not too over powering smell you will love this.</li>
            <li> Its a big bottle for such a low price..I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she likes the fragrance. The price was great and it was delivered in a few days.</li>
            <li> BCBG has a fabulous ad&#x27; campaign with fold outs/peel backs for sampling it&#x27;s new fragrance, Bon Chic.  Whereas the ad&#x27;s scent has a slight fruity sweetness and the predominant quality is the more woodsy note; this is \\&quot;not so\\&quot; from the bottle I ordered. The fruity quality is the predominant note causing me to give this sweet disapointment a 2 star rating.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my daughter.  She picked it out so I couldn&#x27;t go wrong here.  She loves the creative bottle that it comes in.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> I honestly was really excited about finding this product.  I opened the box, and the first thing I noticed that the lid is quite heavy for the bottle, it falls over if I don&#x27;t set it down just right.  Now on to the smell, I sprayed it on my wrists gave a big whiff in and, uh, is this mosquito repellent?? Bummed</li>
