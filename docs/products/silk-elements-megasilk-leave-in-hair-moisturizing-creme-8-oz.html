            <li>This stuff is the best.  </li>
            <li>The BEST!  </li>
            <li>and my hair felt great!!!</li>
            <li>I used this after I got out of the shower, and I slept on my hair and woke up to beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>With the impression of it being a great product because of the ratings on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>AND, best of all - in the winter months I can put my coat on and take it off as many times as I like without looking like</li>
            <li>my husband always tells me how good my hair smells when i have it on</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good product I used it on my daughter and</li>
            <li>all in all its good and the refreshing scent dies out over time.</li>
            <li>Nice try ....</li>
            <li>The smell can be very strong in the beginning</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>However the heat protecting serum  smells better of silk elements.</li>
            <li>Also most of product leaked  out of bottom</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>After taking my twists out, this leave in gave me frizz free hair and defined curls!</li>
            <li>I think this product is better suited for relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>You can always use a bit more, if you need to, but you can&#x27;t remove it without re-washing your hair.</li>
            <li>Good product just not the right one for me.</li>
            <li>My L&#x27;Oreal conditioner does a 90% better job in leaving my hair feeling smooth and silky, and better yet their leave-in -conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love silk elements mega silk leave in conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable and strong , this is great for me</li>
            <li>The product smells great and made my hair so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Soft silky hair in one use great price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, it smells like aloe vera deodorent or body wash(if</li>
            <li>I have dense hair with fine to medium strands and pencil sized coils.</li>
            <li>Helped make it really smooth I&#x27;d order it again.</li>
            <li>My hair was so smooth and shiny with lots of bounce.</li>
            <li>I have over processed hair and this leaves it silky and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I just stuck my finger in a light</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the other customers have experienced or why it did not work for them</li>
            <li>but it goes away really quick.</li>
            <li>it works better then the high end brands .</li>
            <li>I previously used this on my hair when I was relaxed and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this product because it was more solon professional</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, silky (never thought I&#x27;d use the word silky to describe my hair!)</li>
            <li>this moisturizer is pretty good on  my extremely dry hair and as a plus</li>
            <li>This particular product was probably meant for hair that is not so fine as mine.  </li>
            <li>I spelled that right??).</li>
            <li>great product my first time do ill be buying more</li>
            <li>Pretty good the smells a little to perfume smelling for me</li>
            <li>I will order more of these later on.</li>
            <li>It works well for me if i do it like a hot oil treatment and put it on maybe an hour before i shampoo.  </li>
            <li>At first I tried this product when I was styling my hair in a bun.</li>
            <li>remember, don&#x27;t use too much!  </li>
            <li>My new fav product!!</li>
            <li>I think it would work real well for folks with dryer hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>but my extremely over-processed hair thoroughly enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>First, most important note: a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>When just a touch of this  conditioner gets in my eyes they turn super red.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try before you spend a fortune  on the high end products</li>
            <li>In addition to the smooth and shiny hair I didn&#x27;t have to reapply the product until my next wash day a week later.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>When I first bought it I spread every inch of my hair and left it on for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Naturally,  my hair gets puffy, fizzy, and is just uncontrollable.</li>
            <li>And For ME Soft And manageable Also.  </li>
            <li>it is not greasy at all it leaves my hair soft and bouncy with shine to it...definitely recommend</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and this leave in makes my hair feel soft and leaves it moisturized for a week.</li>
            <li>Now I have natural hair</li>
            <li>and it felt soft and silky immediately.  </li>
            <li>My hair is natural and over processed from both bleaching and coloring regularly.  </li>
            <li>No other product in this price range has come close to giving me the same results.  </li>
            <li>Very inexpensive compared to the big name and high priced products I usually use.</li>
            <li>Makes any dry brittle hair soft and manageable.</li>

            <li> I have really thick mixed curly hair that goes just above my waist. Naturally,  my hair gets puffy, fizzy, and is just uncontrollable. I used this after I got out of the shower, and I slept on my hair and woke up to beautiful curls. I was so suprised! The product smells great and made my hair so soft and moisturized. I love it.</li>
            <li> Soft silky hair in one use great price it works better then the high end brands . Give it a try before you spend a fortune  on the high end products .silk elements megasilk  leave in moisturizing cream is treasure , you   can use it on wet hair or dry no more bad hair days.this product will be a stable in my hair routine please do not discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from the local sally&#x27;s store. With the impression of it being a great product because of the ratings on Amazon.  I have thin hair and is very dried because I am constantly flat ironing it.  When I first bought it I spread every inch of my hair and left it on for about 20 minutes. As I washed out the treatment I noticed my hair texture felt dry, no change what so ever.  I was disappointed.  My L&#x27;Oreal conditioner does a 90% better job in leaving my hair feeling smooth and silky, and better yet their leave-in -conditioner.  I wanted to try this product because it was more solon professional but I regret wasting my money on this Silk Elements Leave-in moisturizer because it did NOT moisturize my hair not one bit, don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I like this item, as soon as I applied it to my hair...it became softened, which is a miracle considering my texture. The only thing that I will have to get adjusted to is its scent. It&#x27;s strong, it smells like aloe vera deodorent or body wash(if I spelled that right??). Anyhow, the jar size is big in size 6.8 or 8.6 ml, but the photo makes it seem small...all in all its good and the refreshing scent dies out over time. I will order more of these later on.</li>
            <li> This particular product was probably meant for hair that is not so fine as mine.  It works well for me if i do it like a hot oil treatment and put it on maybe an hour before i shampoo.  I think it would work real well for folks with dryer hair.  Good product just not the right one for me.</li>
            <li> Luv it alot will be buying it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I discovered it by accident but I&#x27;m glad I did.  It is definitely a staple...my go to product for twist and bantu knot outs or a wash and go</li>
            <li> this moisturizer is pretty good on  my extremely dry hair and as a plus my husband always tells me how good my hair smells when i have it on</li>
            <li> Makes hair very manageable. Used for a braid out on hair that is recovering from heat damage. The smell can be very strong in the beginning but it goes away really quick. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  Makes any dry brittle hair soft and manageable. I Uses This On My Son&#x27;s Dry Curly HAIR And UT Made His HAIR Soft Fluffy Curls And For ME Soft And manageable Also.  So recommended</li>
            <li> When just a touch of this  conditioner gets in my eyes they turn super red.  It could be the tea tree oil in it or the olive oil extract.  I threw it out and will never buy again.  There is a warning on the jar to avoid getting into your eyes.  Be careful if you keep yours but mine is going in the trash</li>
            <li> Love it...it is not greasy at all it leaves my hair soft and bouncy with shine to it...definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Pretty good the smells a little to perfume smelling for me but it&#x27;s a good product I used it on my daughter and I. I have curly hair and so does my daughter. Helped make it really smooth I&#x27;d order it again. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the perfume smell. However It&#x27;s just the brand because I order another product  smells the same. However the heat protecting serum  smells better of silk elements.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look greasy. Also most of product leaked  out of bottom</li>
            <li> I love silk elements mega silk leave in conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable and strong , this is great for me I love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product; it leaves my hair moist without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have natural hair and this leave in makes my hair feel soft and leaves it moisturized for a week. At first I tried this product when I was styling my hair in a bun. Usually on wash day I put large twists in the night before to stretch my hair and then style in a bun the next morning for the rest of the week.  After taking my twists out, this leave in gave me frizz free hair and defined curls! I was very surprised. In addition to the smooth and shiny hair I didn&#x27;t have to reapply the product until my next wash day a week later. I also noticed on the jar that it&#x27;s considered a heat protectant. So I decided to give straightening a try while using this product and wow! My hair was so smooth and shiny with lots of bounce. Keep in mind you don&#x27;t need a lot! I use about a nickel to a quarter size amount on each of my 4 divided sections of hair. I spray Pantenes heat protectant and then blow dry my hair. I&#x27;ve never had results like this on my natural/transitioning hair without going to a salon. Usually it looks very dry and is not very smooth. I have dense hair with fine to medium strands and pencil sized coils. My hair tends to be dry so a leave in is a must.</li>
            <li> The BEST!  Leaves your hair so silky.  I have over processed hair and this leaves it silky and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m black this to my hair is like water to a flower, i put it in when i don&#x27;t flat iron my hair, its my conditioner i put it in my wet hair braid it loose it out net day waves like a goddess. I put it in, wait for hair to dry then straighten it, leaves it conditioned and shiny</li>
            <li> I got absolutely no results from the use of this creme. I previously used this on my hair when I was relaxed and it worked great. Now I have natural hair and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for it. I think this product is better suited for relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> First, most important note: a little bit goes a long way!  Use too much and your hair will look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After years of trying to tame my coarse/wavy hair without chopping it all off, I discovered this product.  No other product in this price range has come close to giving me the same results.  Soft, smooth, silky (never thought I&#x27;d use the word silky to describe my hair!) AND, best of all - in the winter months I can put my coat on and take it off as many times as I like without looking like I just stuck my finger in a light socket!&lt;br /&gt;Just remember, don&#x27;t use too much!  Just a dab, rubbed between your hands and smoothed thru wet or dry hair.  You can always use a bit more, if you need to, but you can&#x27;t remove it without re-washing your hair.</li>
            <li> great product my first time do ill be buying more</li>
            <li> Nice try ....no win&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product  can not hold up in the heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sticky, messy  and drips</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other customers have experienced or why it did not work for them but my extremely over-processed hair thoroughly enjoyed this product.  I applied it to my unusually coarse hair....and it felt soft and silky immediately.  My hair is natural and over processed from both bleaching and coloring regularly.  I placed a shower cap on left in on for 30 min and my hair felt great!!! My new fav product!! Very inexpensive compared to the big name and high priced products I usually use.</li>
