            <li>Otherwise it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>one of the best hand lotions</li>
            <li>The size would also make it great to keep in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>I was happy that I found this product on Amazon ,since Avon does not always carry this product.</li>
            <li>not greasy great brightness</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It is very effective on clearing imperfections and &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34; for MY type skin.  </li>
            <li>Might be good for those who can apply at night and then wear gloves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>I bought this Avon hand cream since it had good reviews and sunscreen in it, and because I have always liked Avon&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li>That being said, Avon&#x27;s hand cream is the most affordable and wearable sunscreen/hand cream I have found to date!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy this is available.</li>
            <li>Amazing for me.</li>
            <li>and she really liked it.</li>
            <li>It is also nice that I did have to call a representative to get this product.</li>
            <li>it was shipped to me very quickly, and it is a good company that sent it to me.</li>
            <li>However,I found it is best used over a good quality hand cream,because it does not provide enough moisture when used alone as a hand cream.,</li>
            <li>I love the Avon Anew Clinical line and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>Have been looking for a hand lotion with SPF in it and this fit the bill nicely.  </li>
            <li>Love this - wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued in catalog.</li>
            <li>This is a great hand cream, as it really repairs your skin.</li>
            <li>Have ordered more.</li>
            <li>Be sure to blot your hands/arms before touching any paper, because this stuff WILL leave a grease spot.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hand cream.  </li>
            <li>I really love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay--</li>
            <li>Better hand creams&lt;</li>
            <li>I really love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There might always be a compromise when it comes to sunscreen products because effective sunscreen isn&#x27;t always comfortable on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Rich, nice texture and smell.</li>
            <li>this stuff works great on my old age spots on my hands.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to this being a superb hand cream, based upon the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever tried for dark spots on hands and legs.</li>
            <li>This is a nice size for a large handbag.</li>
            <li>This hand cream is rich, emollient but is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I think Avon products are a good value and work as well as other top brands.</li>
            <li>, while this one is a bit lighter than I like (I prefer creamier lotions), it&#x27;s a good one that I will definitely re-purchase.  </li>
            <li>wa spaying full price through the Avon catalogue,</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m loving it, but it has yet to stand the test of treating dehydrated Winter hands.</li>
            <li>and my husband remarked unexpectedly how nice my hands look.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel nice and soft</li>
            <li>Great to use at bedtime to maximize the active ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I found Avon Anew...</li>
            <li>its not greasy at all and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>The hand cream does a nice job of smoothing and I have seen some sunspot fading in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>Looking for quickly absorbed, soothing lotion for backs of hands.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll make sure before buying it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it will help, but it doesn&#x27;t feel good at all.  </li>
            <li>but it is the only hand cream that really makes my hands feel smooth and keeps my fingers from cracking.  </li>
            <li>It does not seem very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>but I am almost done with tube and have noticed no lightening of my brown spots which is really what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>I put some on my wrist &amp; you can see the sparkles straight up, so i was kinda</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so I anticipate it lasting a long time except that I keep using it more places (now neck and chest).</li>
            <li>Absorbs well and leave my hands feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>skin brightening &amp; sunscreen with a soft pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hands feel soft or moist.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything that my old lotion didn&#x27;t do for me.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is overdone and the greasy residue ensures that I will NEVER waste my money on this again.</li>
            <li>I am glad that amazon sells Avon products because I only need a few things</li>
            <li>reviewer mentioned that it&#x27;s hard to spread, but I don&#x27;t so at all; it&#x27;s light enough to spread right in, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling too greasy, so you can use your computer keyboard soon after applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t had it too long, I can&#x27;t speak to its anti-aging claims, but I do really like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this hand cream, but it seems to provide a subtle sheen, goes on light, isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If swallowed get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.  </li>
            <li>Avon&#x27;s, however, is smooth, absorbable and hardly chalky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been making my own sunscreen/hand cream concoctions for years but my homemade versions are often greasy and uncomfortable on the skin.  </li>

            <li> I think I paid less than $10 for this Avon Anew Clinical Luminosity Pro Brightening \\&quot;Hand\\&quot; Cream which I have found is the only product that actually makes my elbows soft.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure it really brightens my hands</li>

            <li> Seems to improve the condition of my skin for far less $ than the luxury brands.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and though less expensive on Amazon, I wish it cost a bit less.</li>
            <li> I use on my heels and it makes a bigger difference in my dry/cracked heels than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a warning on the back of the tube which states, among other things:</li>
            <li> i would recommed this product to persons that have dry hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been diligent for years about wearing sunscreen each day, but I&#x27;ve noticed the last few years that my hands are starting to give my age away.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it less than 5 stars is that I wish it had SPF 30 instead of 15.</li>
            <li> Only a little needed.</li>
            <li> If you just want something other than the watered down lotions you normally buy, get this extremely thick lotion.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount</li>
            <li> AND...you skin doesn&#x27;t sweat under it which I have found other &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; lotions do.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the texture as well as other hand creams w/ SPF.  </li>
            <li> I just thought this hand cream was specifically for dark age spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Whether dark spots lighten, hard to tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; properties because it just isn&#x27;t practical to use.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to get hand cream with an SPF</li>
            <li> It is greasy and hard to spread.  </li>
            <li> This cream works well must use at least twice a day .</li>
            <li> This will lighten nothing on your hands, but it is a thick moist cream.</li>
            <li> , my face looked so shiny, not even subtle looking at all!</li>
            <li> Just sorry Avon isn&#x27;t not carrying it any longer.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find hand creams with sunscreen in them.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be an expensive hand lotion product.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was greatly disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been diligent for years about wearing sunscreen each day, but I&#x27;ve noticed the last few years that my hands are starting to give my age away.  I bought this Avon hand cream since it had good reviews and sunscreen in it, and because I have always liked Avon&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that it&#x27;s hard to spread, but I don&#x27;t so at all; it&#x27;s light enough to spread right in, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling too greasy, so you can use your computer keyboard soon after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this tube to keep on my desk at work so that I will apply it before heading out in the sun. The size would also make it great to keep in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t had it too long, I can&#x27;t speak to its anti-aging claims, but I do really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a hand cream junkie, and, while this one is a bit lighter than I like (I prefer creamier lotions), it&#x27;s a good one that I will definitely re-purchase.  When I ordered this Avon lotion, I also ordered [[ASIN:B00142HI3A Robanda Anti-Aging Hand Cream, SPF 20 Hand Treatment 3oz]], and I like them about the same.</li>
            <li> I used to use Glove Me Tender by Bath &amp; Body Works, but they stopped making it. Luckily I found Avon Anew...skin brightening &amp; sunscreen with a soft pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is rich, emollient but is not greasy. Great to use at bedtime to maximize the active ingredients.  I wash my hands a lot in my profession and feel that this cream met my moisturizing expectations.  However, I have not used it long enough to say anything about the brightening qualities.  I love the Avon Anew Clinical line and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a hand lotion with SPF in it and this fit the bill nicely.  Absorbs well and leave my hands feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Love this - wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued in catalog.</li>
            <li> I think I paid less than $10 for this Avon Anew Clinical Luminosity Pro Brightening \\&quot;Hand\\&quot; Cream which I have found is the only product that actually makes my elbows soft.  I use on my heels and it makes a bigger difference in my dry/cracked heels than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.

            <li> this stuff works great on my old age spots on my hands. its not greasy at all and absorbs quickly.  it was shipped to me very quickly, and it is a good company that sent it to me. regards, karen anderson</li>
            <li> This is a great hand cream, as it really repairs your skin. I wa spaying full price through the Avon catalogue, but now will order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My wife loves it and has got me using.  Can&#x27;t say enough about the end results of using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and though less expensive on Amazon, I wish it cost a bit less. The hand cream does a nice job of smoothing and I have seen some sunspot fading in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this hand cream, but it seems to provide a subtle sheen, goes on light, isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m loving it, but it has yet to stand the test of treating dehydrated Winter hands. I will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> Looking for quickly absorbed, soothing lotion for backs of hands. This is great. Only a little needed. Have ordered more. Whether dark spots lighten, hard to tell. I can still see them.</li>
            <li> Seems to improve the condition of my skin for far less $ than the luxury brands. Applying it only to the backs of my hands works for me.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is greasy. Be sure to blot your hands/arms before touching any paper, because this stuff WILL leave a grease spot. Even if you think you&#x27;ve rubbed it all in. I&#x27;m not sure of the \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; properties because it just isn&#x27;t practical to use. It does not seem very moisturizing. Might be good for those who can apply at night and then wear gloves. If you didn&#x27;t, you&#x27;d get grease stains all over your sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a warning on the back of the tube which states, among other things: If swallowed get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.  May stain some fabrics.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand cream.  Just sorry Avon isn&#x27;t not carrying it any longer.  This cream does just what it says.</li>
            <li> It works , but you must use sun screen when exposed to the sun as with any products that help with brown spots . I was happy that I found this product on Amazon ,since Avon does not always carry this product.</li>
            <li> I really love this hand cream.  It is difficult to find hand creams with sunscreen in them.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and my husband remarked unexpectedly how nice my hands look.  I like that it is unscented and non-greasy.  The only reason I gave it less than 5 stars is that I wish it had SPF 30 instead of 15. Otherwise it is perfect.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size for a large handbag. It is creamy without that greasy residue and has no scent ( that I can detect). The bonus is the SPF. I find it hard to get hand cream with an SPF so I&#x27;m happy this is available.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my car to protect my hands while driving.  Rich, nice texture and smell.</li>
            <li> This really works.  The back of my hands look smoother and the brown spots have faded.  I put it on daily - it has the benefit of a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice and soft but I am almost done with tube and have noticed no lightening of my brown spots which is really what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a hand cream that will help with \\&quot;age spots,\\&quot; so I decided to try this one.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it will help, but it doesn&#x27;t feel good at all.  It is greasy and hard to spread.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hands feel soft or moist.</li>
            <li> I found it to be an expensive hand lotion product. It didn&#x27;t do anything that my old lotion didn&#x27;t do for me.</li>
            <li> one of the best hand lotions and ive used everything not greasy great brightness</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay--I wouldn&#x27;t re-order it.  It&#x27;s a good moisturizer however, I wouldn&#x27;t place it in anti-aging category.  Better hand creams&lt;br /&gt;around.</li>
            <li> This product should of been kept in the Avon line....It is very effective on clearing imperfections and &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34; for MY type skin.  Not just for on my hands. Actually softens skins and doesn&#x27;t soak in like some products.  You don&#x27;t have to put it on several times a day.  AND...you skin doesn&#x27;t sweat under it which I have found other &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; lotions do.  Amazing for me.</li>
            <li> I really love this hand cream.  I am not sure it really brightens my hands but it is the only hand cream that really makes my hands feel smooth and keeps my fingers from cracking.  I hope Avon does not discountinue it.  My local rep. could no longer get it.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this being a superb hand cream, based upon the other reviews.  Sadly, I was greatly disappointed.  It is greasy and stinky.  The fragrance is overdone and the greasy residue ensures that I will NEVER waste my money on this again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever tried for dark spots on hands and legs. A bargain at any price.</li>
            <li> This will lighten nothing on your hands, but it is a thick moist cream. If you just want something other than the watered down lotions you normally buy, get this extremely thick lotion. I continue to buy it for only that reason. It will not lighten anything on your hands, at all.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little bit of lightening of some spots on my hands after using for over a month, but thought it might be a little bit better after reading other reviews...</li>
            <li> I like the reflective &#x27;softening appearance&#x27; that this gave my hands. However,I found it is best used over a good quality hand cream,because it does not provide enough moisture when used alone as a hand cream.,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the texture as well as other hand creams w/ SPF.  Does nothing to &amp;#34;brighten&amp;#34; my skin either.  I like Avon products though, so I thought I would give it a try!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend for Christmas and she really liked it. I think Avon products are a good value and work as well as other top brands. It is also nice that I did have to call a representative to get this product. I am glad that amazon sells Avon products because I only need a few things and I don’t want to be bothered by phone calls from a rep. every month.</li>
            <li> Nobody&#x27;s fault.  I just thought this hand cream was specifically for dark age spots but it seems it&#x27;s not.  Next time I&#x27;ll make sure before buying it</li>
            <li> Product delivered promptly, and item was as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making my own sunscreen/hand cream concoctions for years but my homemade versions are often greasy and uncomfortable on the skin.  Avon&#x27;s, however, is smooth, absorbable and hardly chalky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There might always be a compromise when it comes to sunscreen products because effective sunscreen isn&#x27;t always comfortable on the skin.  That being said, Avon&#x27;s hand cream is the most affordable and wearable sunscreen/hand cream I have found to date!</li>
            <li> This cream works well must use at least twice a day . Recommend this cream for spots to hand. Great product.</li>
            <li> This was a present from a friend. I put some on my wrist &amp; you can see the sparkles straight up, so i was kinda if-fy if i could use it on my face, omg i tried nevertheless, my face looked so shiny, not even subtle looking at all! So i will be returning this and buying something else.</li>
            <li> have sold avon before, had a walking territory so knew what the products are like so  i would recommed this product to persons that have dry hands</li>
