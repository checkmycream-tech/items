            <li>They make a perfect combination together with Dr. Mercola&#x27;s fluoride-free toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This is the best price I have found.</li>
            <li>This is the best toothbrush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>My greatest concern is avoiding gum damage, and they do an excellent job.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to find them on Amazon, and to have the choice of getting them in the mailer rather than the boxes, which I don&#x27;t need every time.</li>
            <li>The case it comes in is also great for travel.</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these toothbrushes for a while now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with their quality.</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li>Love the company!</li>
            <li>LOVE the fact that they are made from recycled yogurt containers and that you can use the wrapper to mail (postage paid!)</li>
            <li>A nice bonus is the manufacturer&#x27;s pro-environment stand as these units are made from recycled material.</li>
            <li>Toothbrushes are recycled and recycleable, and very comfortable with a nice angle.</li>
            <li>Incredibly pleasant on the gums and environmentally friendly, since they&#x27;re made out of used yoghurt cups.</li>
            <li>This over time creates an erosion and sensitivity of teeth along the gum line, especially on a top row of teeth opposite to a brushing hand</li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Top notch in my book.</li>
            <li>I love the product and the fact that it is made from recycled materials.  </li>

            <li>My partner also loved using his new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I originally bought one of these in a health food store and when I saw them here in a six pack I had to order them.</li>
            <li>Otherwise only widely available in Whole Foods, this is the best toothbrush for anyone who wants a good soft toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t pull at the gums or wear the enamel.  </li>
            <li>Happy for spending a bit less on them.</li>
            <li>I love these ultra soft brushes.</li>
            <li>It lasts, it&#x27;s handy, and I&#x27;ve even used the return mailer to send them back for recycling.  </li>
            <li>Love the ultra soft head and the ability to recycle when finished.  </li>
            <li>more easily than other designs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would make more sense to be &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; for this company if the plastic contained a portion of plant-based plastic, such as corn husks.</li>
            <li>Been buying/using this exact toothbrush for longer than a year.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first brush in Mailbu.</li>
            <li>Regardless of which toothpaste you use, I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>A fantastic EXTRA soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush, so soft and very gently on the gums, since I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The angle is just right for my back teeth, and they are very soft.</li>
            <li>Tried this new vendor because lower cost per brush.</li>
            <li>I ran out of replacements and had to use another brand of toothbrush until my new preserve one arrived.  </li>
            <li>Color selection is a little non-standard, but fine.</li>
            <li>My dentist says to use ultra soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>The Preserve Ultra Soft bristles are indeed soft[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B0047QILQS Preserve Adult Ultra Soft Toothbrush (Pack of 6)]].</li>
            <li>They are &amp;#34;ultra soft&amp;#34; and even my 21 year old wanted one.</li>
            <li>Ultra Soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Neede because have &#x27;toothbrush abrasion&#x27; &amp; stores don&#x27;t carry decent EXTRA soft.</li>
            <li>(dominant).&lt;br /&gt;A curve along the handle also allows more natural grip and less twisting of the shoulder and elbow, which is more ergonomically pleasing and allows to exert even less pressure on hard to reach places in one&#x27;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The feature of the built-in envelop to send your toothbrush for a recycling is not worth a stamp to me.</li>
            <li>I let them rest in hot water for a little bit.</li>
            <li>The main two features I buy it for is availability of very soft bristles and a curved handle.&lt;br /&gt;The soft bristles are a necessity for me since I have always been a rough and hard when brushing teeth.</li>

            <li> She has to use ultra soft due to receding gums, and her dentist recommends these.  </li>

            <li> i was so disappointed with my purchase - the brush is narrow and rough on my gums - only opened 2 of the 6 brushes we received and when we tried them we found they hurt our gums - Attempted to return the remaining 4 and was told by customer service that it was a 6 pack</li>
            <li> I tend to brush my teeth to hard.</li>
            <li> If someone is bending the bristles, then they&#x27;re brushing too hard in my opinion.  </li>

            <li> Love these toothbrushes!  Love the company!</li>
            <li> This simple design toothbrush has a lot going for it. The main two features I buy it for is availability of very soft bristles and a curved handle.&lt;br /&gt;The soft bristles are a necessity for me since I have always been a rough and hard when brushing teeth. This over time creates an erosion and sensitivity of teeth along the gum line, especially on a top row of teeth opposite to a brushing hand (dominant).&lt;br /&gt;A curve along the handle also allows more natural grip and less twisting of the shoulder and elbow, which is more ergonomically pleasing and allows to exert even less pressure on hard to reach places in one&#x27;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The feature of the built-in envelop to send your toothbrush for a recycling is not worth a stamp to me. I recycle everything in my house anyway in a 65 gallon bin provided by my garbage disposal company for free.&lt;br /&gt;It would make more sense to be &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; for this company if the plastic contained a portion of plant-based plastic, such as corn husks. Ford Motor company puts 20% corn derived plastic into their insulation foam.&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing folks!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love these ultra soft brushes. Great product</li>
            <li> Otherwise only widely available in Whole Foods, this is the best toothbrush for anyone who wants a good soft toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t pull at the gums or wear the enamel.  It lasts, it&#x27;s handy, and I&#x27;ve even used the return mailer to send them back for recycling.  I order them in bulk because I refuse to use anything else even for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that my gums are a bit too &#x27;retracted&#x27; for my age and recommended I use a softer brush. So I got these and I could not be happier. They actually stay the same &#x27;level&#x27; of softness as the time goes on. Incredibly pleasant on the gums and environmentally friendly, since they&#x27;re made out of used yoghurt cups. Plus, the manufacturer includes an envelope to mail the used toothbrush back so that it can be recycled. Top notch in my book. They make a perfect combination together with Dr. Mercola&#x27;s fluoride-free toothpaste. Regardless of which toothpaste you use, I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> A fantastic EXTRA soft toothbrush. Neede because have &#x27;toothbrush abrasion&#x27; &amp; stores don&#x27;t carry decent EXTRA soft. Have purchased these before from other vendor (entire family uses &amp; loves). Been buying/using this exact toothbrush for longer than a year.  Tried this new vendor because lower cost per brush. Reason likely because package does not include a &#x27;travel case&#x27; per brush. No matter to me. I want the toothbrush. Happy for spending a bit less on them. Ordered 2 sets (total 12 toothbrushes).  Will order again &amp; again!</li>
            <li> I love the product and the fact that it is made from recycled materials.  I would recommend them to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Does a great job.  My dentist says to use ultra soft bristles.  This is the best price I have found.</li>
            <li> i was so disappointed with my purchase - the brush is narrow and rough on my gums - only opened 2 of the 6 brushes we received and when we tried them we found they hurt our gums - Attempted to return the remaining 4 and was told by customer service that it was a 6 pack and I am not able to return only 4 - therefore - I have to pay for entire order that I am throwing in the garbage - will never buy from America rx again!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush, so soft and very gently on the gums, since I have very sensitive teeth. My partner also loved using his new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my aunt.  She has to use ultra soft due to receding gums, and her dentist recommends these.  She used them regularly and likes them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding an Ultra Soft toothbrush and need it because of a receding gum line. The Preserve Ultra Soft bristles are indeed soft[[ASIN:B0047QILQS Preserve Adult Ultra Soft Toothbrush (Pack of 6)]]. The packaging is reuseable to return the brush to Preserve (postage paid) for recycling. In addition the handle of the brush is made from 100% plastic (including yogurt cups.) What a find.</li>
            <li> I moved, and have had a hard time finding these in stores in my new town. My stock was running low. I was so happy to find them on Amazon, and to have the choice of getting them in the mailer rather than the boxes, which I don&#x27;t need every time. The angle is just right for my back teeth, and they are very soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used.  I have been using this brand for several years.  I ran out of replacements and had to use another brand of toothbrush until my new preserve one arrived.  With the other brand it felt like I could not reach my wisdom teeth.  It was a relief to receive my preserve toothbrush and be able to once again brush my wisdom teeth.  This product is great!</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes are recycled and recycleable, and very comfortable with a nice angle. Preserve supports #5 plastic recycling in retail locations as well.</li>
            <li> I originally bought one of these in a health food store and when I saw them here in a six pack I had to order them. They are &amp;#34;ultra soft&amp;#34; and even my 21 year old wanted one.</li>
            <li> Love the ultra soft head and the ability to recycle when finished.  The case it comes in is also great for travel.</li>
            <li> Ultra Soft. They mean it. I have sensitive teeth and these are the only brushes that don&#x27;t hurt. The handle shape is weird but it actually allows you to brush the back of your teeth (even the back of the molars!) more easily than other designs. Color selection is a little non-standard, but fine. LOVE the fact that they are made from recycled yogurt containers and that you can use the wrapper to mail (postage paid!) the toothbrushes back to the company so that they can recycle them again into things like plastic decking.</li>
            <li> I bought my first brush in Mailbu. I loved it.  I tend to brush my teeth to hard. This brush does not, fits well in my hand. I have given one to my friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these toothbrushes for a while now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with their quality. My greatest concern is avoiding gum damage, and they do an excellent job. I usually like to get the bristles even softer before brushing, so I let them rest in hot water for a little bit. If someone is bending the bristles, then they&#x27;re brushing too hard in my opinion.  I highly recommend them. A nice bonus is the manufacturer&#x27;s pro-environment stand as these units are made from recycled material.</li>
