            <li>Great fragrance, victoria´s secret garden strawberries and champagne is soft and sexy, suitable for every day, office or simply a friend meeting and very refreshing body mist splash, you will love it.</li>
            <li>I still have the container though, it&#x27;s great for filling with water or some other product to spray things with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>FOR ALL SEASONS  BUY IT QUICK AND USE IT</li>

            <li> It actually has a sort of alcoholic, hand-sanitizer type of smell that really didn&#x27;t sit well with me.</li>
            <li> I have used this flavor for a very long time, that is why I keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m really not).</li>
            <li> ONE THINK OF GLASS OF PINK CHAMPAGNE</li>
            <li> but, when it arrived it was leaking through the book and was almost half way through!It had been poorly wrapped, this the first time it happens to me.</li>
            <li> This was actually cheaper online than at the store as usual</li>
            <li> I watched my hard earned money flushed down the toilet in the form of the liquid perfume.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a little too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> I want the lotion to this and the entire Victoria secret line wish I can give it a ma million stars.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> HAS A VERY DELICATE SMELL NOT OVER WHELMING</li>
            <li> what else can be said about vickies secret body sprays!</li>
            <li> But this one failed in the feminine smell department.</li>
            <li> I have nothing wrong to say.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m crazy but it doesn&#x27;t smell like strawberries and champagne.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with any of these bath and body products!</li>
            <li> Hate it doesnt smell anything like strawberries or champagne. .</li>
            <li> Very disappointed &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> No, I&#x27;m not that cruel.</li>
            <li> It smells nasty.</li>

            <li> Smell very very good on my girl</li>
            <li> The Strawberries &amp; Champagne body mist must be one of the best body sprays around. It smells wonderful. I received it before the estimated date!</li>

            <li> I got this body spray for my sister and she loved the smell of it! I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love Victoria&#x27;s Secret Garden body sprays! They are so light and floral-y and I always get complimented on my scent. Especially from my bf. But this one failed in the feminine smell department. It actually has a sort of alcoholic, hand-sanitizer type of smell that really didn&#x27;t sit well with me. To make my opinion more credible and less relative: my friends(male &amp;female) actually agreed with me, they weren&#x27;t too fond of the scent. So you might be wondering what I did with the almost brand new bottle after buying and not using it. Regift? No, I&#x27;m not that cruel. Trash? Yes,sort of. I watched my hard earned money flushed down the toilet in the form of the liquid perfume. I still have the container though, it&#x27;s great for filling with water or some other product to spray things with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May I direct all those reading this to the Pure Seduction or Love Spell Body Mists instead? I promise you&#x27;ll love those or...I&#x27;m a liar (I&#x27;m really not).</li>

            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend at the time.  She had run out and we could not find any available in the local stores.  This was actually cheaper online than at the store as usual so it was worthwhile.  She absolutely loves this scent.</li>
