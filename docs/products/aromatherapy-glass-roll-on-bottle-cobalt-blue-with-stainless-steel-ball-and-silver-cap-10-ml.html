            <li>will absolutely order again.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>The lids do not fit tightly, but all in all, a great product.</li>
            <li>The actual bottles seem to work fine as long as you always keep them upright.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery everything I expected.</li>
            <li>These cobalt blue glass bottles with the stainless roller ball are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My wife used these for her essential oils and they leaked all over and when using to apply them way too much would come out.</li>
            <li>I initially messaged the company, and they immediately sent me new lids.</li>

            <li> The metal ball doesn&#x27;t stick like the plastic ones do, and it feels cold against the skin, I like it.  </li>

            <li> These bottles are good, and the metal rollers are good. None of them were damaged or cracked upon arrival, and they are a great size. However, the lids do not fully close with the rollerball attached. I initially messaged the company, and they immediately sent me new lids. That&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars instead of 3. The actual bottles seem to work fine as long as you always keep them upright. I do think that some of my oils evaporate, but that is just a theory of mine. If the lids screwed on correctly,  these would be fantastic.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Work well, nice quality, and have never leaked.  Will order again!</li>

            <li> I use these to mix my essential oils with jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I used some for oils, and so far i have been pleased.</li>
