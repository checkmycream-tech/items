            <li>I think using it twice a week is best!  </li>
            <li>One of the best experiences in my online purchase history.</li>
            <li>I am a African-American and I believe that my skin is already supple, but I use this and then put the Jason&#x27;s Aloe vera cream on before and after and my skin looks flawless.</li>
            <li>I roll it over the needed areas 50-100 times and that has been working great.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been working just great for me.</li>
            <li>(lol)</li>
            <li>This item is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but painfull</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell if I&#x27;m getting the results I&#x27;m hoping for, but as for the quality it seems good and as does the price.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The roller came on time and was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>and now I own the product</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so clear and beautiful!!!  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend noticed, and he thinks my complexion looks better.  </li>
            <li>I AM SOOOOOOO GLAD</li>
            <li>(needed to add more words</li>
            <li>so figured I&#x27;d offer a reminder :)</li>
            <li>but I am pleased to say this is my 1st day using it.</li>
            <li>And I see much better results when I use Mederma or cocoa butter after using the derma roller.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and the more you roll it on your skin</li>
            <li>the better skin peeling you&#x27;d have.</li>
            <li>It is well made, comes with it&#x27;s own case and thus far after using it 3 times, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use the Micro-needle Roller in the evening due to redness and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty deep wrinkles on my face at age 60, amazing results!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s diminished my fine lines</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use a cream for this treatment afterward.</li>
            <li>You can get a skin infection if you don&#x27;t thoroughly clean before and after.  </li>
            <li>When my cousin saw me she noticed right off the bat!</li>
            <li>you will not get good penetration because the needles, which are actually spikes, are so close together</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this product more than a month and half , this one is a good product</li>
            <li>it gave my skin infection and pimple even though i was very gently every time i using it and cleaned with alcohol !</li>
            <li>Feels okay when using it and did not lead to any skin problems so far.</li>
            <li>Make sure NOT to share your roller with someone else and to clean properly after each use!!</li>
            <li>You will need to figure out the right amount of times for your face/skin.</li>
            <li>I like the roller very much.</li>
            <li>It first started when I was in my teens.</li>
            <li>I love this item and plan on using this for a long time.</li>
            <li>Please be gentle with yourself while using the roller.</li>
            <li>but my wife said doesn&#x27;t hurt that much.</li>
            <li>and I really like that it is durable product.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I bought my fiance this product and this work insanely fast its no joke</li>
            <li>now she loves it so much</li>
            <li>i have been using bigger sizes needle but this one i realized that the smaller the needle, the better it works for your pores to decrease its size, and for that, im buying this types.</li>
            <li>In order to speed up your results you have to add pressure until you see bleeding because that indicates your epidermis has been punctured and that new cells (skin is about to be repaired).</li>
            <li>i use this roller up to 5 times, and you&#x27;d know for yourself if you need to throw them,and get a new one,</li>
            <li>New to this type of skin care but so far this derma roller is doing everything it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>An unexpected side effect was it got rid of some flesh colored bumps on my face called milia.  </li>
            <li>but I am encouraged by the results so far.  </li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive I would recommend trying the smallest size to start-off, which is the 0.25 size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far tighter skin also.</li>
            <li>use this only once or twice a week, and very carefully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Decent purchase overall.</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly tough, so I experienced little of the stinging, redness, or discomfort that others have described.</li>
            <li>But the key to using it so restore new skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything under the sun as far as skincare goes various kinds of facials, all kinds of skincare products including store-bought and natural remedies, exfoliation, micro-dermabrasion, etc.. and nothing</li>
            <li>she has stretch marks that are barely noticeable</li>
            <li>This has helped reduce my smile lines and lines a few lines on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I am a young african american female and I have been scarred by acne boxcar scars for years now.</li>
            <li>I did the other side the evening after and didn&#x27;t need to use the roller again for a full week, so I use it once a week to a week and a half.</li>

            <li> As first I was skeptical about this product because I didn&#x27;t know that I would receive the same results</li>
            <li> No more and no less.</li>
            <li> I probably should have ordered the .25 mm size instead of the .5 because the .5 hurts my more flexible, tender skin badly.</li>
            <li> As for the pain, it&#x27;s minimal.  </li>
            <li> However, be careful when using it!  </li>
            <li> First off let me say that my mom is an Esthetician, so needless to say  </li>
            <li> I should review this item and the other rollers in six months.</li>
            <li> cause it hurts to roll them when the needles arent sharp anymore..</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful.</li>
            <li> i was expecting it to pinch a little based on the reviews</li>
            <li> The process of damaging the skin a little promote healing is interesting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind that these are needles so it will be a bit painful, but COMPLETELY WORTH</li>
            <li> I took a few hour nap after my face felt on fire.</li>
            <li> I heard about this from my esethecian (sp?), it must be some big secret.</li>
            <li> my black heads are so bad that it helps me clear them out!!!</li>
            <li> not as painful as the longer needles, but long enough to feel them</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> even comes close to this neat little tool!!!</li>
            <li> you get very poor penetration, and even for that you must push very hard.</li>
            <li> It looks scary</li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy</li>
            <li> but I was just as shocked.  </li>
            <li> Think about it the metal needle rolling around your skin no wonder that got infection that was my bad experience !</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE BAD SKIN BUY THIS PRODUCT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using  this for my strech marks and really helps, i usually use it evey night before put in some lotion.</li>
            <li> The roller came on time and was nicely packaged. Feels okay when using it and did not lead to any skin problems so far. Decent purchase overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but painfull</li>
            <li> This has helped reduce my smile lines and lines a few lines on my forehead.  My boyfriend noticed, and he thinks my complexion looks better.  I recommend this item.  However, be careful when using it!  Always wash your face thoroughly and disinfect the needle roller with hydrogen peroxide.  Don&#x27;t be stingy with the hydrogen peroxide!  You can get a skin infection if you don&#x27;t thoroughly clean before and after.  As for the pain, it&#x27;s minimal.  As a matter of fact, I will probably upgrade to a .75mm when I turn 30 or so.  I think using it twice a week is best!  No more and no less.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to help with some acne scars &amp; tone issues.  An unexpected side effect was it got rid of some flesh colored bumps on my face called milia.  Too soon to notice scar improvements but I am encouraged by the results so far.  Please be gentle with yourself while using the roller.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that my mom is an Esthetician, so needless to say  I have tried everything under the sun as far as skincare goes various kinds of facials, all kinds of skincare products including store-bought and natural remedies, exfoliation, micro-dermabrasion, etc.. and nothing even comes close to this neat little tool!!! Also I have the world&#x27;s oiliest skin (no exaggeration) and this tool even helps with that!!!!!! My skin has never been so clear and beautiful!!!  When my cousin saw me she noticed right off the bat! I was like &amp;#34;YESSSS!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so first I tested it out in a small area on my left cheekbone and by morning I was stunned at the difference.  All the tiny bumps/pimples in that area were gone. (I was in total shock!!!)  I did the other side the evening after and didn&#x27;t need to use the roller again for a full week, so I use it once a week to a week and a half. I roll it over the needed areas 50-100 times and that has been working great.  You will need to figure out the right amount of times for your face/skin. (I haven&#x27;t tried this on my stretch marks yet..maybe that&#x27;ll be next)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no clue which size to buy, so I just went with the size I saw advertised in a lot of places, which was the 0.5mm Needle size and it&#x27;s been working just great for me. If your skin is sensitive I would recommend trying the smallest size to start-off, which is the 0.25 size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Important Notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Please keep in mind that these are needles so it will be a bit painful, but COMPLETELY WORTH THE PAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s best to use the Micro-needle Roller in the evening due to redness and sensitivity.  By morning your skin should be rested and healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Your skin may be dry after using the roller, so just put some moisturizer on or skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE BAD SKIN BUY THIS PRODUCT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!  I AM SOOOOOOO GLAD I DID!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if I&#x27;m getting the results I&#x27;m hoping for, but as for the quality it seems good and as does the price.&lt;br /&gt;** Make sure NOT to share your roller with someone else and to clean properly after each use!! (needed to add more words so figured I&#x27;d offer a reminder :)</li>
            <li> saw a difference, would recommend a try! not as painful as the longer needles, but long enough to feel them</li>
            <li> with only 3 uses my face has cleared up faster than with any other products. i was expecting it to pinch a little based on the reviews but it actually is PAIN-FREE in my opinion.  IT DIDNT LEAVE MY FACE RED, SCRATCHED NOR DID IT BLEED? I love this item and plan on using this for a long time. (my review is based on the 0.5mm roller. My skin type is oily &amp; dry and i have acne scars and stress pimples every once in a while)</li>
            <li> I like the roller very much. So far tighter skin also. I hear it takes atleast three months to see results. So we shall see the outcome then.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly tough, so I experienced little of the stinging, redness, or discomfort that others have described. In fact, I just ordered  1. and 1.5 rollers. I&#x27;ve only used the .5 roller twice, so I cannot say I notice any difference in my skin. Building collagen takes time. I should review this item and the other rollers in six months. By then, I&#x27;ll know if they work.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. It looks scary but my wife said doesn&#x27;t hurt that much. Hopefully this thing last.</li>
            <li> I would have not ever know a product exist if I didn&#x27;t read for myself, so I went on Amazon to check it out and now I own the product and I really like that it is durable product. thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where to start! I am a young african american female and I have been scarred by acne boxcar scars for years now. It first started when I was in my teens. As first I was skeptical about this product because I didn&#x27;t know that I would receive the same results but I am pleased to say this is my 1st day using it. I took a few hour nap after my face felt on fire. (lol) And when I woke up after some bleeding had ceased my face was noticeable different. I know this sounds crazy but I was just as shocked.  read a blog about a guy who has been doing this for time now because of the severity of his acne. But the key to using it so restore new skin. And I don&#x27;t think a lot of customers understand this aspect of the treatment. In order to speed up your results you have to add pressure until you see bleeding because that indicates your epidermis has been punctured and that new cells (skin is about to be repaired). It lets me know that as long as I continue this then I will be rid of these boxcar scars in no time. I would highly recommend! Received in 2 business days. One of the best experiences in my online purchase history.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my roller for about 2 weeks and I like it. I probably should have ordered the .25 mm size instead of the .5 because the .5 hurts my more flexible, tender skin badly. I have to be very careful. But, with the use of stretch mark lotions after use of the roller, I see a difference in my stretch marks. I haven&#x27;t used this on my face and won&#x27;t use it on my face, so I can&#x27;t say I personally know it works for anything but the appearance of stretch marks. And I see much better results when I use Mederma or cocoa butter after using the derma roller.</li>
            <li> This item is absolutely amazing! I am a African-American and I believe that my skin is already supple, but I use this and then put the Jason&#x27;s Aloe vera cream on before and after and my skin looks flawless.</li>
            <li> I love it my black heads are so bad that it helps me clear them out!!!</li>
            <li> i have been using bigger sizes needle but this one i realized that the smaller the needle, the better it works for your pores to decrease its size, and for that, im buying this types. i use this roller up to 5 times, and you&#x27;d know for yourself if you need to throw them,and get a new one, cause it hurts to roll them when the needles arent sharp anymore.. and the more you roll it on your skin the better skin peeling you&#x27;d have. my skin peels off after 2 days from the day i use this.</li>
            <li> for me not working, it may be that if you use it for a long time, this product works, I can not locate different opinions before buying Thank</li>
            <li> I heard about this from my esethecian (sp?), it must be some big secret. I ordered the .5mm, 540 needles about 3 weeks ago. I have pretty deep wrinkles on my face at age 60, amazing results!!!  It&#x27;s diminished my fine lines and I just ordered 1.0mm for marionette lines. It&#x27;s important to use a cream for this treatment afterward. I use Bumble and Bee  organic face cream. I think I will try the vitamin C recommended next. I definitely recommend it for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. YouTube has videos on how to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought my fiance this product and this work insanely fast its no joke shes been on her treatments with this roller and she has stretch marks that are barely noticeable now she loves it so much and she has only been using it for a short time</li>
            <li> I bought this product more than a month and half , this one is a good product but  it gave my skin infection and pimple even though i was very gently every time i using it and cleaned with alcohol ! If i have to rate this product i can give it 5 starts but because the result is matter then i give it 1 starts. Think about it the metal needle rolling around your skin no wonder that got infection that was my bad experience !</li>
            <li> New to this type of skin care but so far this derma roller is doing everything it is supposed to. It is well made, comes with it&#x27;s own case and thus far after using it 3 times, I am happy with it. Hoping to get the results I am looking for so I may have another review in a month or two. I would recommend this for anyone that is considering trying a derma micro needle skin health plan.</li>
            <li> The process of damaging the skin a little promote healing is interesting.&lt;br /&gt;I use this only once or twice a week, and very carefully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought one for a friend who likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order the 500 needle roller you will not get good penetration because the needles, which are actually spikes, are so close together you get very poor penetration, and even for that you must push very hard. Look for the roller with 200 needles and it will work!</li>
            <li> Quality product that seems to work well and as advertised. But I won&#x27;t know for six months just how well...</li>
