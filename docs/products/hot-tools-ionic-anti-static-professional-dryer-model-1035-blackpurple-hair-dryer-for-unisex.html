            <li>It is the best hair dryer!</li>
            <li>It was the best dryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>And to kick it all, I like it BETTER than the Chi!!!  </li>
            <li>now, I can&#x27;t buy a no-name brand because everyone who comes to my house expects me to have the best in hair care products (even my mother in law commented on how I have the best &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and she loves excuses to stay and use my shampoo and conditioner lol).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately, Amazon was very good about refunding me and there wasn&#x27;t any issue on that end.</li>
            <li>This was a great price and works great, and has all the features I wanted!</li>

            <li>Great hair dryer, transaction went smooth.  </li>
            <li>but kind of frizzes as the day wears on)</li>
            <li>which is saying a lot since I have gray hair that has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>I liked this hair dryer while it worked.</li>
            <li>Aveda used to make a wonderful product that really took that static out</li>
            <li>The attachment falls off very easily.</li>
            <li>The lint screen removes very easily and can be cleaned in seconds and replaced.</li>
            <li>I really liked this blow-dryer until it gave out after 10 months of very light use.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and looks much more shiny!!!!</li>

            <li>I love love LOVE this blowdryer!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful light weight fast drying blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this blowdryer a week ago, and I admit that it works great on my very frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t spend money on a Chi again, just to have it go out with very light use in just over a year.  </li>
            <li>Very light.  </li>
            <li>It is also very light.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I wind up putting it in a ponytail most of the time because I can&#x27;t stand the static.  </li>
            <li>but I bought it for the anti-static, and I&#x27;m really pleased with that aspect of it.</li>
            <li>This dryer leaves my smooth and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I love it, of course my husband used it before I did.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this hair dryer a couple of months ago and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>This is an OK hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with this hairdryer until it broke on me the fourth time using it!  </li>
            <li>With that, I had a Chi blow dryer, top of the line, ionic, you name it</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love the 3 heat settings and 3 drying levels.</li>
            <li>am glad I selected this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my college bound daughter, she has been extremely pleased with the dryer.  </li>
            <li>Used on a regular basis the dryer has performed wonderfully since purchasing it in August 2006.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I use the low heat setting and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I totally love it.</li>
            <li>Best Christmas present EVER!</li>
            <li>and I still had frizzy static hair.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and dries hair quickley!</li>
            <li>I love the varied settings for heat and strength, and the cool shot is nice too.  </li>
            <li>It dries pretty good.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very quickly and gives it a nice full body look.</li>
            <li>the sister of a very sweet cosmetologist</li>
            <li>Love it and it is so light weight</li>
            <li>it drys my hair very quickly......</li>
            <li>Good dryer, very simple and has a nice combination of settings.</li>
            <li>the fact that it gave me almost a decades use means I am strongly considering buying a replica.  </li>
            <li>Very light &amp; dries hair quickly without frizz.</li>
            <li>Liked the first one</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t take all the frizz out of my hair (it starts off looking just fine</li>
            <li>and then it would be &#x27;fine&#x27; . . .</li>
            <li>It is light weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I like this dryer when its functional because its light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fine, for the price I could just say, \\&quot;whatever.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Amazon customer service was quick to help me though, and I was able to get a refund.</li>
            <li>This is made cheaply and is junk, do not spend your money on this dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair is superfine, and in the winter when it gets all staticky it makes me nuts.  </li>
            <li>it leaves it feeling light and airy.</li>
            <li>I order this as a birthday gift and while the blow dryer is great the actual package was torn up!</li>
            <li>Real bummer as I was so thrilled with its performance.</li>
            <li>and this product has the power to make my hair nice and smooth without much effort.</li>
            <li>This dryer is lightweight by very powerful.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product, and am going to buy the Helen of Troy Professional Ceramic Hair Dryer (which I&#x27;ve used at my gym and works great, and seems to be a higher quality product) instead.</li>
            <li>Having worked at Ulta during college, I grew to love the Hot Tools products.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>It was worth it!</li>
            <li>This works great and has really helped cut down on my static!</li>
            <li>and I thought I just needed to clean the vent.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not as loud as others I have owned, the cord is longer than some, it has a nice attachment, good buttons to choose from, and a nice little rubber nub on each side so that it doesn&#x27;t slide off the counter, too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light and easy to handle..</li>
            <li>and I was very happy with it for the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>but it REALLY doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with any static.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer is light yet powerful.  </li>
            <li>and I like it better straight</li>
            <li>It has a cool blast switch to lock the style in place.</li>
            <li>My itty bitty hair dryer from 2000 did as good of a job as the ion/ceramic/multi-function hair dryers of present day.  </li>
            <li>I think the high fan setting is a bit fast for styling, but is good for drying hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery, product is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>I figure 10 years of great service it worth $26 to buy the exact same one again.</li>
            <li>, she always makes sure I have the absolute BEST of anything hair related - shampoo, conditioner, flat iron, curling iron, blow dryer, etc.  </li>
            <li>Received the item quickly.</li>
            <li>but overall I am more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>REally works well, lots of power, good dials/settings, and not to loud.  </li>
            <li>It dries very fast and accurately.</li>
            <li>Of course, there is a high setting if you do want more.</li>
            <li>Dryer is powerful, much better than ones from drugstore that cost the same or more.</li>
            <li>and it takes me a good 10-15 minutes to dry my hair so lightweight is a must.  </li>
            <li>Overall I love it!</li>
            <li>This has lasted much better than my top of the line Chi ever thought about giving me, and I will definitely look for this brand again (if not purchase this exact one again!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first tried this dryer at my sisters and then bought one!  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is even better than my old one!</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not as cute it does dry my hair better.</li>
            <li>I was happy with this dryer for about the first week, after which Low speed no longer worked and it was stuck on High all the time.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was so thrilled with her dryer that I purchased the same model for myself and it has been in use for over 2 years.  </li>
            <li>I already own 3 different hair dryers from this brand.</li>
            <li>On the low flow airflow setting, it blew vaguely warm.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The only draw back for me was the cool shot could be cooler, besides that thank you for a great prodcut Hot Tools!</li>
            <li>I love how light weight this hair dryer is, and how quick it gets my hair dry!  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I can now do it in under 10 minutes flat.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it has several speed and heat settings, but it&#x27;s nothing special.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to handle, comfortable to hold, and has multiple controls for varying speed and temperature.  </li>
            <li>Loved this dryer and it dried my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It just met the bare minimum requirements for a hair dryer, nothing more.  </li>
            <li>I would use the Chi to dry my bangs (short) and just the very top roots, not even the top layer, just the roots.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend a blow dryer that cost a little more, because you&#x27;ll end up spending more money having to buy another one in a year.</li>
            <li>dryers my hair super fast and no frizz</li>
            <li>I figured the watts at 1875 would be as strong as my old conair.</li>
            <li>Drys hair very fast with no frizz - even in Winter.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is very light, quieter than some, but still pretty loud on high.</li>
            <li>, I love my Hot Tools curling iron, with BETTER reviews than the Chi, Helen Of Troy, and all the other high ones -</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I could tell the difference the ions made - my hair felt smoother.  </li>
            <li>Got this hair dryer after my Hot tools</li>
            <li>I recieved this product yesterday and used it first thing this morning.  </li>
            <li>Kinda cheap looking and kinda loud</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, going to buy a second one.</li>
            <li>like it says ~ I can only compare it to my roommates Conair hair dryer that I seemed to get a better result with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now been replaced with a lesser but more dependable brand until I can find something comparable.</li>
            <li>Where was a hot flash when I needed one?</li>
            <li>and it definitely does NOT eliminate static.</li>
            <li>Now the dryer won&#x27;t stay hot.</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with this dryer and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this thing exactly once.</li>
            <li>I will most likely return.</li>
            <li>Upon first use, this item did not blow hot air.</li>
            <li>I found it to be like most of the drug-store blowers in my blower-graveyard in the closet, going to the next garage sale.</li>
            <li>Always go for the Hot Tools as the professionals use this product</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was looking for a faster drying, and more quiet hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>The dryer doesn&#x27;t get hot anymore.</li>
            <li>The anti-static feature is great, especially for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Which is wonderful, since I have a 7 month old and now I can go to bed with dry hair without spending all night trying to dry it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is wonderful, since I have a 7 month old and now I can go to bed with dry hair without spending all night trying to dry it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The high / hot heat is hot!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is easy to use and dry&#x27;s your hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair pretty fast and cuts out some of the frizz with the ions.</li>
            <li>Love the long cord too.</li>
            <li>Fast and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  </li>
            <li>So for fine hair users, it may be worthwhile to shop around since there are very few resources for our types.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>But at full force and the hottest setting, it is not as powerful as our smaller travel blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Certainly, the outside of the barrel of the unit gets extremely hot to the touch very quickly and continues to get hotter until you turn it off or to high blower speed.</li>
            <li>The other noteworthy thing is that cleaning lint out of the dryer is so easy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I thought it worth updating this review, as it has been nearly 5 years since I purchased two of these dryers, and they are still going strong with daily use!</li>
            <li>Static was a big issue, so when shopping for a blower with high wattage, high heat (yes, I want HOT) and high velocity, I found this one hoping it would meet the requirements.</li>
            <li>I use a round brush to curl the ends under, the multiple settings on the drier works great for this type of styling.</li>
            <li>really helps me style it well........</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>Works very well on my hair.</li>
            <li>I thought after all the money spent on Chi&#x27;s (and how many my sister had sold for them), they would be of SOME</li>
            <li>Dries my hair much faster and seems to leave it silkier</li>
            <li>so much I bought a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does what it says it&#x27;s going to do at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer dries my hair much faster and my hair doesn&#x27;t begin to stick to the surfaces around me.  </li>
            <li>It dries all this hair really fast.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really curly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use as much hair product because this blow dryer makes my hair straight with basically just a brush.</li>
            <li>Fast, doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t weaken over time.</li>
            <li>didnt really like it.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight.</li>
            <li>I get ready in a carpeted area</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is very lightweight, plus has all kinds of features and speeds.</li>
            <li>My husband hasn&#x27;t been complaining about the noise as much, but I don&#x27;t know if its</li>
            <li>She absolutely raves how much she loves it, and how much quicker it takes her to get ready.</li>
            <li>and she recommended this for personal, at-home use due to a good blend of price and quality.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, it would only work on the high setting (while fluctuating between hot and cool).</li>
            <li>I have a &amp;#34;no frills&amp;#34; hairstyle (long, naturally straight and fine) that can air-dry and still look</li>
            <li>So many other dryers give you \\&quot;high\\&quot; and \\&quot;higher\\&quot; as choices.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair out to straighten most of the time, but noticed with this dryer it makes it too soft and too straight.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and really dries my hair but doesn&#x27;t dry it out!  </li>
            <li>This is a good blow dryer, but less then a year later it broke.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is also nice and slick not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer to replace my old Hot Tools hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I was soooo surprised the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Love them and will never go for anything less than that quality.</li>
            <li>just purchased a more expensive model to see if i like it better.</li>
            <li>On the day that my blow dryer finally died, I quickly purchased this model.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Hot Tools dryers in the past and I just love how lightweight they are.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, it stopped working all together after getting very hot and smelling like it was melting.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it.......</li>
            <li>I turned it on to high and</li>
            <li>, if you are looking for high heat with no air flow... or ...no heat with high air flow, this is the blow dryer for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stuck on high.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>She spoke highly of the product and manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>However, upon opening, the dryer did not work on the High setting.  </li>
            <li>On the high airflow setting, it blew cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer- for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love the long cord (8ft) but the vent keeps coming off and it will only point in one direction.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a bit smaller as it is sort of hard to store but other than that I am very happy.</li>
            <li>I take it everywhere because no other hair dryer can dry my long layered hair as quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Dries my long hair really quickly.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for an affordable dryer that will last, and don&#x27;t use/need a diffuser, I would recommend this particular Hot Tools dryer.</li>
            <li>It was light and didn&#x27;t tire my arm or wrist, it got hot enough to dry my hair, and it wasn&#x27;t extremely loud like a lot of dryers are.</li>
            <li>Typically I would just grab a hat and go .. but not now .. finally I can actually feel good about the looks of my hair before heading out the door.  </li>
            <li>This dryer gets my hair dry quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>A couple things I dislike are that it&#x27;s very loud and the attachment does not stay on well.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very fast on a low setting</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone looking for a professional type product without the high cost.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that when I use the hottest setting,it&#x27;s not as hot as I would like it.</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s too hot to put back</li>
            <li>My trusty Hot Tools dryer that I bought from Ulta died on me after two years of daily use...</li>
            <li>It works better than a more expensive one I had prior to this one.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this blow dryer and flat iron at the same time for my own personal use.  </li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this dryer because you&#x27;ll spend more time hunting down the nozzle than actually drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t in the market for a new hair dryer but, thanks to my husband, who deep sixed my old one using it to thaw frozen water pipes at our cabin, I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I have been very pleased with this particular hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>If he takes the hint you can avoid having to go to a &#x27;Very Important Family Event&#x27; scaring small children (and some adults, I might add!)</li>
            <li>It not heavy... doesnt create alot of heat to damage the hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this hair dryer to meet my needs drying my longer hair, and it&#x27;s a much appreciated lighter weight than my last one.</li>
            <li>So I found this one, a professional brand</li>
            <li>I was therefore surprised when it shot out sparks and smoke while using it yesterday morning.  </li>
            <li>I had the option to buy another hair dryer, and went with the same one again, after going over many others that were more expensive or were different.  </li>
            <li>This professional dryer is just what it says, professional .</li>
            <li>This hair dryer completely died about 6 months after I bought it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to notice a difference in dryers until you really jump into a different price bracket with the T-3s and Chi&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It is much lighter and still has the same fast drying power of the last one.</li>
            <li>My grandmother is a professional hair dresser</li>
            <li>A replacement for my old Elchim.  </li>
            <li>I am loving how light weight it is, I have long hair and sometimes my arm gets tired from being up in the air that long.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if people can stand behind their products.</li>
            <li>I have really long think hair that can take a solid 30 minutes to dry with most hair dryers.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted over 15 years, I&#x27;m hoping this one lasts as long or longer!</li>
            <li>Yes the give out like all hair dryers and I have to buy a new one, but quality is always the same when I have to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I bought this very basic, inexpensive hair dryer since I normally don&#x27;t have time for air-drying.  </li>
            <li>My hair dries like it normally would air-drying, only a lot faster.  </li>
            <li>because he knows I bought a new hair dryer trying to please him, or if it&#x27;s actually a lower frequency.</li>
            <li>One of the things that I have come to really appreciate about this dryer is that the low fan setting truly is low.</li>
            <li>My hair took longer to dry and it was so loud!!!</li>
            <li>, it is light weight and has cut my dry time down about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>This drier works fast on my hair, and with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well and definitely dries quicker than my old dryer.</li>
            <li>Let me stop here and clarify light use on thick hair -</li>
            <li>I loved this blow dryer and now here i am completely unhappy.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer to replace my previous Hot Tools hair dryer that had broken after many years of use.</li>
            <li>It worked &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; for the past 2 years--it dried my hair in about 10 minutes but left lots of little frizzes on top that I would then have to smooth out with an iron.  </li>
            <li>Had this blow dryer for less then 2 weeks and it stopped blowing hot air.  </li>
            <li>However, after a month and a half of using it once every day for about 15 mins, it stopped blowing hot air.</li>
            <li>I was waiting to purchase this brand of hair dryer after using other Hot Tools styling tools when my hair dryer finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>Hot Tools hair dryers last longer than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly but not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>Other dryers left my hair feeling dull, dried out, and full of static.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely say that it is faster than my old dryer, and I&#x27;m amazed at how quiet it is!  </li>
            <li>Good power, multiple heat settings, and doesn&#x27;t have that motor wind that some put out that drive you crazy.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not dry my hair, but living in NE there are a lot of snow days in the winter.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair that normally takes up to 20 minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li>This is a lot lighter than my previous one but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same power and oomph Hot Tools</li>
            <li>It will actually dry my full thick, long head of hair straight out of the shower in 10 minutes tops.  </li>
            <li>It will actually dry my full thick, long head of hair straight out of the shower in 10 minutes tops.  </li>
            <li>However, after barely a year, suddenly it blew nothing hotter than luke-warm air.</li>
            <li>and they were basically no help (barely understood English).  </li>
            <li>It takes a few seconds to get the hot air and the plastic attachments fall off.</li>
            <li>I bought this a little over a year ago, used it 5 to 6 times a week to dry my short hair, and kept the dust/lint trap clean regularly.</li>
            <li>If I put it on the low setting, it would turn bright red inside and not blow any air (SCARY!).</li>
            <li>and it took close to an hour to fully blow dry my hair with my old conair dryer.</li>
            <li>I do like the IDEA of the Ions leaving your hair less staticy and healthier, but I don&#x27;t know that I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and needed a dryer that would work quickly.</li>
            <li>However, since the performance of this hairdryer was nothing special and it didn&#x27;t last very long, I guess it is time for at least a modest upgrade with my next hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>I have thick Asian hair and it dries it quickly</li>
            <li>It works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don&#x27;t want to damage, but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style.</li>
            <li>Not very powerful, although it does dry hair fast.</li>
            <li>It is stuck on high and just slides up and down.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great hair dryer, transaction went smooth.  </li>
            <li> but kind of frizzes as the day wears on)</li>
            <li> which is saying a lot since I have gray hair that has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> I liked this hair dryer while it worked.</li>
            <li> Aveda used to make a wonderful product that really took that static out</li>
            <li> The attachment falls off very easily.</li>
            <li> The lint screen removes very easily and can be cleaned in seconds and replaced.</li>
            <li> I really liked this blow-dryer until it gave out after 10 months of very light use.</li>

            <li> I just bought this blowdryer a week ago, and I admit that it works great on my very frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t spend money on a Chi again, just to have it go out with very light use in just over a year.  </li>
            <li> Very light.  </li>
            <li> It is also very light.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I wind up putting it in a ponytail most of the time because I can&#x27;t stand the static.  </li>
            <li> but I bought it for the anti-static, and I&#x27;m really pleased with that aspect of it.</li>
            <li> This dryer leaves my smooth and shiny!  </li>
            <li> I love it, of course my husband used it before I did.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this hair dryer a couple of months ago and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> This is an OK hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this hairdryer until it broke on me the fourth time using it!  </li>
            <li> With that, I had a Chi blow dryer, top of the line, ionic, you name it</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the 3 heat settings and 3 drying levels.</li>
            <li> am glad I selected this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my college bound daughter, she has been extremely pleased with the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Used on a regular basis the dryer has performed wonderfully since purchasing it in August 2006.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I use the low heat setting and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I totally love it.</li>
            <li> Best Christmas present EVER!</li>
            <li> and I still had frizzy static hair.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and dries hair quickley!</li>
            <li> I love the varied settings for heat and strength, and the cool shot is nice too.  </li>
            <li> It dries pretty good.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very quickly and gives it a nice full body look.</li>
            <li> the sister of a very sweet cosmetologist</li>
            <li> Love it and it is so light weight</li>
            <li> it drys my hair very quickly......</li>
            <li> Good dryer, very simple and has a nice combination of settings.</li>
            <li> the fact that it gave me almost a decades use means I am strongly considering buying a replica.  </li>
            <li> Very light &amp; dries hair quickly without frizz.</li>
            <li> Liked the first one</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t take all the frizz out of my hair (it starts off looking just fine</li>
            <li> and then it would be &#x27;fine&#x27; . . .</li>
            <li> It is light weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer when its functional because its light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fine, for the price I could just say, \\&quot;whatever.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Amazon customer service was quick to help me though, and I was able to get a refund.</li>
            <li> This is made cheaply and is junk, do not spend your money on this dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair is superfine, and in the winter when it gets all staticky it makes me nuts.  </li>
            <li> it leaves it feeling light and airy.</li>
            <li> I order this as a birthday gift and while the blow dryer is great the actual package was torn up!</li>
            <li> Real bummer as I was so thrilled with its performance.</li>
            <li> and this product has the power to make my hair nice and smooth without much effort.</li>
            <li> This dryer is lightweight by very powerful.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product, and am going to buy the Helen of Troy Professional Ceramic Hair Dryer (which I&#x27;ve used at my gym and works great, and seems to be a higher quality product) instead.</li>
            <li> Having worked at Ulta during college, I grew to love the Hot Tools products.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It was worth it!</li>
            <li> This works great and has really helped cut down on my static!</li>
            <li> and I thought I just needed to clean the vent.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not as loud as others I have owned, the cord is longer than some, it has a nice attachment, good buttons to choose from, and a nice little rubber nub on each side so that it doesn&#x27;t slide off the counter, too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light and easy to handle..</li>
            <li> and I was very happy with it for the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> but it REALLY doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with any static.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer is light yet powerful.  </li>
            <li> and I like it better straight</li>
            <li> It has a cool blast switch to lock the style in place.</li>
            <li> My itty bitty hair dryer from 2000 did as good of a job as the ion/ceramic/multi-function hair dryers of present day.  </li>
            <li> I think the high fan setting is a bit fast for styling, but is good for drying hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery, product is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> I figure 10 years of great service it worth $26 to buy the exact same one again.</li>
            <li> , she always makes sure I have the absolute BEST of anything hair related - shampoo, conditioner, flat iron, curling iron, blow dryer, etc.  </li>
            <li> Received the item quickly.</li>
            <li> but overall I am more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> REally works well, lots of power, good dials/settings, and not to loud.  </li>
            <li> It dries very fast and accurately.</li>
            <li> Of course, there is a high setting if you do want more.</li>
            <li> Dryer is powerful, much better than ones from drugstore that cost the same or more.</li>
            <li> and it takes me a good 10-15 minutes to dry my hair so lightweight is a must.  </li>
            <li> Overall I love it!</li>
            <li> This has lasted much better than my top of the line Chi ever thought about giving me, and I will definitely look for this brand again (if not purchase this exact one again!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first tried this dryer at my sisters and then bought one!  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is even better than my old one!</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not as cute it does dry my hair better.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this dryer for about the first week, after which Low speed no longer worked and it was stuck on High all the time.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was so thrilled with her dryer that I purchased the same model for myself and it has been in use for over 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I already own 3 different hair dryers from this brand.</li>
            <li> On the low flow airflow setting, it blew vaguely warm.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only draw back for me was the cool shot could be cooler, besides that thank you for a great prodcut Hot Tools!</li>
            <li> I love how light weight this hair dryer is, and how quick it gets my hair dry!  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I can now do it in under 10 minutes flat.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it has several speed and heat settings, but it&#x27;s nothing special.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to handle, comfortable to hold, and has multiple controls for varying speed and temperature.  </li>
            <li> Loved this dryer and it dried my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It just met the bare minimum requirements for a hair dryer, nothing more.  </li>
            <li> I would use the Chi to dry my bangs (short) and just the very top roots, not even the top layer, just the roots.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend a blow dryer that cost a little more, because you&#x27;ll end up spending more money having to buy another one in a year.</li>
            <li> dryers my hair super fast and no frizz</li>
            <li> I figured the watts at 1875 would be as strong as my old conair.</li>
            <li> Drys hair very fast with no frizz - even in Winter.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very light, quieter than some, but still pretty loud on high.</li>
            <li> , I love my Hot Tools curling iron, with BETTER reviews than the Chi, Helen Of Troy, and all the other high ones -</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I could tell the difference the ions made - my hair felt smoother.  </li>
            <li> Got this hair dryer after my Hot tools</li>
            <li> I recieved this product yesterday and used it first thing this morning.  </li>
            <li> Kinda cheap looking and kinda loud</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, going to buy a second one.</li>
            <li> like it says ~ I can only compare it to my roommates Conair hair dryer that I seemed to get a better result with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been replaced with a lesser but more dependable brand until I can find something comparable.</li>
            <li> Where was a hot flash when I needed one?</li>
            <li> and it definitely does NOT eliminate static.</li>
            <li> Now the dryer won&#x27;t stay hot.</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with this dryer and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this thing exactly once.</li>
            <li> I will most likely return.</li>
            <li> Upon first use, this item did not blow hot air.</li>
            <li> I found it to be like most of the drug-store blowers in my blower-graveyard in the closet, going to the next garage sale.</li>
            <li> Always go for the Hot Tools as the professionals use this product</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a faster drying, and more quiet hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The dryer doesn&#x27;t get hot anymore.</li>
            <li> The anti-static feature is great, especially for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Which is wonderful, since I have a 7 month old and now I can go to bed with dry hair without spending all night trying to dry it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is wonderful, since I have a 7 month old and now I can go to bed with dry hair without spending all night trying to dry it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The high / hot heat is hot!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is easy to use and dry&#x27;s your hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair pretty fast and cuts out some of the frizz with the ions.</li>
            <li> Love the long cord too.</li>
            <li> Fast and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  </li>
            <li> So for fine hair users, it may be worthwhile to shop around since there are very few resources for our types.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> But at full force and the hottest setting, it is not as powerful as our smaller travel blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Certainly, the outside of the barrel of the unit gets extremely hot to the touch very quickly and continues to get hotter until you turn it off or to high blower speed.</li>
            <li> The other noteworthy thing is that cleaning lint out of the dryer is so easy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I thought it worth updating this review, as it has been nearly 5 years since I purchased two of these dryers, and they are still going strong with daily use!</li>
            <li> Static was a big issue, so when shopping for a blower with high wattage, high heat (yes, I want HOT) and high velocity, I found this one hoping it would meet the requirements.</li>
            <li> I use a round brush to curl the ends under, the multiple settings on the drier works great for this type of styling.</li>
            <li> really helps me style it well........</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> Works very well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I thought after all the money spent on Chi&#x27;s (and how many my sister had sold for them), they would be of SOME</li>
            <li> Dries my hair much faster and seems to leave it silkier</li>
            <li> so much I bought a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does what it says it&#x27;s going to do at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer dries my hair much faster and my hair doesn&#x27;t begin to stick to the surfaces around me.  </li>
            <li> It dries all this hair really fast.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really curly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use as much hair product because this blow dryer makes my hair straight with basically just a brush.</li>
            <li> Fast, doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t weaken over time.</li>
            <li> didnt really like it.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight.</li>
            <li> I get ready in a carpeted area</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very lightweight, plus has all kinds of features and speeds.</li>
            <li> My husband hasn&#x27;t been complaining about the noise as much, but I don&#x27;t know if its</li>
            <li> She absolutely raves how much she loves it, and how much quicker it takes her to get ready.</li>
            <li> and she recommended this for personal, at-home use due to a good blend of price and quality.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it would only work on the high setting (while fluctuating between hot and cool).</li>
            <li> I have a &amp;#34;no frills&amp;#34; hairstyle (long, naturally straight and fine) that can air-dry and still look</li>
            <li> So many other dryers give you \\&quot;high\\&quot; and \\&quot;higher\\&quot; as choices.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair out to straighten most of the time, but noticed with this dryer it makes it too soft and too straight.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and really dries my hair but doesn&#x27;t dry it out!  </li>
            <li> This is a good blow dryer, but less then a year later it broke.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is also nice and slick not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace my old Hot Tools hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I was soooo surprised the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Love them and will never go for anything less than that quality.</li>
            <li> just purchased a more expensive model to see if i like it better.</li>
            <li> On the day that my blow dryer finally died, I quickly purchased this model.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Hot Tools dryers in the past and I just love how lightweight they are.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, it stopped working all together after getting very hot and smelling like it was melting.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it.......</li>
            <li> I turned it on to high and</li>
            <li> , if you are looking for high heat with no air flow... or ...no heat with high air flow, this is the blow dryer for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stuck on high.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> She spoke highly of the product and manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> However, upon opening, the dryer did not work on the High setting.  </li>
            <li> On the high airflow setting, it blew cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer- for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the long cord (8ft) but the vent keeps coming off and it will only point in one direction.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit smaller as it is sort of hard to store but other than that I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I take it everywhere because no other hair dryer can dry my long layered hair as quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Dries my long hair really quickly.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for an affordable dryer that will last, and don&#x27;t use/need a diffuser, I would recommend this particular Hot Tools dryer.</li>
            <li> It was light and didn&#x27;t tire my arm or wrist, it got hot enough to dry my hair, and it wasn&#x27;t extremely loud like a lot of dryers are.</li>
            <li> Typically I would just grab a hat and go .. but not now .. finally I can actually feel good about the looks of my hair before heading out the door.  </li>
            <li> This dryer gets my hair dry quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> A couple things I dislike are that it&#x27;s very loud and the attachment does not stay on well.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very fast on a low setting</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone looking for a professional type product without the high cost.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that when I use the hottest setting,it&#x27;s not as hot as I would like it.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s too hot to put back</li>
            <li> My trusty Hot Tools dryer that I bought from Ulta died on me after two years of daily use...</li>
            <li> It works better than a more expensive one I had prior to this one.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this blow dryer and flat iron at the same time for my own personal use.  </li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this dryer because you&#x27;ll spend more time hunting down the nozzle than actually drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t in the market for a new hair dryer but, thanks to my husband, who deep sixed my old one using it to thaw frozen water pipes at our cabin, I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have been very pleased with this particular hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> If he takes the hint you can avoid having to go to a &#x27;Very Important Family Event&#x27; scaring small children (and some adults, I might add!)</li>
            <li> It not heavy... doesnt create alot of heat to damage the hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this hair dryer to meet my needs drying my longer hair, and it&#x27;s a much appreciated lighter weight than my last one.</li>
            <li> So I found this one, a professional brand</li>
            <li> I was therefore surprised when it shot out sparks and smoke while using it yesterday morning.  </li>
            <li> I had the option to buy another hair dryer, and went with the same one again, after going over many others that were more expensive or were different.  </li>
            <li> This professional dryer is just what it says, professional .</li>
            <li> This hair dryer completely died about 6 months after I bought it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to notice a difference in dryers until you really jump into a different price bracket with the T-3s and Chi&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It is much lighter and still has the same fast drying power of the last one.</li>
            <li> My grandmother is a professional hair dresser</li>
            <li> A replacement for my old Elchim.  </li>
            <li> I am loving how light weight it is, I have long hair and sometimes my arm gets tired from being up in the air that long.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if people can stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> I have really long think hair that can take a solid 30 minutes to dry with most hair dryers.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted over 15 years, I&#x27;m hoping this one lasts as long or longer!</li>
            <li> Yes the give out like all hair dryers and I have to buy a new one, but quality is always the same when I have to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I bought this very basic, inexpensive hair dryer since I normally don&#x27;t have time for air-drying.  </li>
            <li> My hair dries like it normally would air-drying, only a lot faster.  </li>
            <li> because he knows I bought a new hair dryer trying to please him, or if it&#x27;s actually a lower frequency.</li>
            <li> One of the things that I have come to really appreciate about this dryer is that the low fan setting truly is low.</li>
            <li> My hair took longer to dry and it was so loud!!!</li>
            <li> , it is light weight and has cut my dry time down about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This drier works fast on my hair, and with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and definitely dries quicker than my old dryer.</li>
            <li> Let me stop here and clarify light use on thick hair -</li>
            <li> I loved this blow dryer and now here i am completely unhappy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace my previous Hot Tools hair dryer that had broken after many years of use.</li>
            <li> It worked &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; for the past 2 years--it dried my hair in about 10 minutes but left lots of little frizzes on top that I would then have to smooth out with an iron.  </li>
            <li> Had this blow dryer for less then 2 weeks and it stopped blowing hot air.  </li>
            <li> However, after a month and a half of using it once every day for about 15 mins, it stopped blowing hot air.</li>
            <li> I was waiting to purchase this brand of hair dryer after using other Hot Tools styling tools when my hair dryer finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> Hot Tools hair dryers last longer than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly but not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Other dryers left my hair feeling dull, dried out, and full of static.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely say that it is faster than my old dryer, and I&#x27;m amazed at how quiet it is!  </li>
            <li> Good power, multiple heat settings, and doesn&#x27;t have that motor wind that some put out that drive you crazy.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not dry my hair, but living in NE there are a lot of snow days in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair that normally takes up to 20 minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> This is a lot lighter than my previous one but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same power and oomph Hot Tools</li>
            <li> It will actually dry my full thick, long head of hair straight out of the shower in 10 minutes tops.  </li>
            <li> It will actually dry my full thick, long head of hair straight out of the shower in 10 minutes tops.  </li>
            <li> However, after barely a year, suddenly it blew nothing hotter than luke-warm air.</li>
            <li> and they were basically no help (barely understood English).  </li>
            <li> It takes a few seconds to get the hot air and the plastic attachments fall off.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a year ago, used it 5 to 6 times a week to dry my short hair, and kept the dust/lint trap clean regularly.</li>
            <li> If I put it on the low setting, it would turn bright red inside and not blow any air (SCARY!).</li>
            <li> and it took close to an hour to fully blow dry my hair with my old conair dryer.</li>
            <li> I do like the IDEA of the Ions leaving your hair less staticy and healthier, but I don&#x27;t know that I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and needed a dryer that would work quickly.</li>
            <li> However, since the performance of this hairdryer was nothing special and it didn&#x27;t last very long, I guess it is time for at least a modest upgrade with my next hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> I have thick Asian hair and it dries it quickly</li>
            <li> It works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don&#x27;t want to damage, but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful, although it does dry hair fast.</li>
            <li> It is stuck on high and just slides up and down.  </li>
            <li> While the flat iron is still working fine, the blow dryer quit working approximately 50 days after purchase.  </li>
            <li> However, I do wish it was a little quieter on high speed, or else have a medium speed setting to select.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how long the last one lasted.  </li>
            <li> Especially because of the long cord.</li>
            <li> and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hair dryer connoisseur, and I have 100% curly hair and just wanted it to dry my hair before I flat iron it occasionally</li>
            <li> I have this for a few days and already ordering something new.</li>
            <li> Sometimes at night, I wouldn&#x27;t use the dryer at all and let my hair air dry then use the curling/straight iron the next morning.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer dries my hair in half the time my old one did.</li>
            <li> My only complaint of this dryer is that the nozzle doesn&#x27;t stay on very well once it heats up.  </li>
            <li> It takes the same amount of time to dry my hair, and to me, it doesn&#x27;t seem any quieter.  </li>
            <li> After the last one died (stopped blowing heated air), I snipped off the cord and gave it to my son to play pretend with, and he spent the next 10 minutes pounding it on the floor like a hammer, with no damage to the body, if you&#x27;re worried about dropping it.  </li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced and dried my hair faster than any other dryer I have used.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me a really long time to dry my hair, and when I do it gets really frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> It was not quiet and not fast.</li>
            <li> From the description I expected this dryer to be smaller and lighter than it was.</li>
            <li> My widfe loves he long cord and the temperature settings, no longer burning her hair</li>
            <li> She always complained how long it took to dry her hair, and I couldn&#x27;t think of much else to get her.</li>
            <li> This is a typical problem for dryers and I&#x27;ve come to expect it, even from more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I mean really will not stay on.  </li>
            <li> I got this dryer in 2003 and have used it every single day on my long hair.</li>
            <li> Well what can I say, other then this dryer is terrific.......</li>
            <li> its fairly quiet, compared to other dryers I\\&quot;ve had.  </li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought due to</li>
            <li> Extension cord is very long.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I need to dry my hair before I head out.</li>
            <li> Maybe $30 dollars a year is what it costs to dry your hair?...</li>
            <li> so it use to take me about 20 min to dry .  </li>
            <li> It has plenty of power and gets my hair dry in record time.</li>
            <li> I cleaned the lint filter regularly and only used it a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> Look elsewhere or expect a limited product lifespan.</li>
            <li> It will get hot and stay hot for about 60 seconds and then it will flash green inside of the barrel and the air will turn cold.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t dry my hair!</li>
            <li> and this took forever to dry it!</li>
            <li> When my previous dryer crapped out, I searched for it and replaced it with the same model.  </li>
            <li> i think I could have spend about $15 less and still achieved the same look and quality.  </li>
            <li> and my hair goes from dripping wet to almost completely dry.</li>
            <li> This came shortly after retiring my previously used items after four+ years of use.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight hair that normaly takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, as I&#x27;d really liked everything else about this dryer.</li>
            <li> At high blower speed the heating elements turn off even when set on high temp and all you get is cold air.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pink zebra one broke.</li>
            <li> The vent poece on the back is removeable for cleaning out lint that gets trapped in there...</li>
            <li> I carefully unplugged it and disposed of</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Pink Dragon Ionic Hair Dryer had...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, has a good-shaped grip, and it&#x27;s just the right proportion to style with (not a short nozzle or weird handle that you have to compensate for).  </li>
            <li> It sounds like a few other reviewers have had this same issue.  </li>
            <li> She claims that it does dry her hair faster and with less frizz.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like I can buy a universal diffuser to fit it. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> A little less than a year later the hair dryer&#x27;s motor has malfunctioned.</li>
            <li> so when I go outside on a humid day, the places where my hair is naturally curly curl up worse and the rest loses the style I intended when I left the house.</li>
            <li> It is also quieter than other driers i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> With other hairdryers you have to turn up the heat where the hairdryer sometimes smells like it&#x27;s burning</li>
            <li> I wash my hair about every other day.  </li>
            <li> My hair drys faster with this model than with any other brand I have ever used, and it styles my hair</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair, and unfortunately, the speed of drying has not changed even with a much newer and larger model than the one I chose to use 14 years ago.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after a year of moderate use it suddenly developed a stench and then died in about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, the cord is long, it&#x27;s a little quieter than my previous hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t as fluffy after I blow dry it as it used to be with previous hair dryers.</li>
            <li> If either died tomorrow, we would be hard pressed to replace it with a different model.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve used this on average 3-5 times a week.  </li>
            <li> It probably had an average use of 10 minutes a week.  </li>
            <li> I probably used it on average 2x a week for those 10 months, then it died.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d say sucks is that it doesnt come with a diffuser and the nozzle is an odd oval shape</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t push the soft-touch buttons down without pain in my fingers.</li>
            <li> But it takes forever to dry, so I had used it very LIGHTLY for 1 year and 3 months before something went bad and it no longer heated (a very common problem).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it isnt like the other reviews and doesnt break in a few weeks</li>
            <li> The weight of the unit has not been an issue, as some have previously stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I have less breakage.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair in half the time that I was spending with a drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li> In all honesty, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this one, and my previous $10 Revlon one from Walmart.</li>
            <li> I stupidly tried it only once waiting for my current one to die completely</li>
            <li> do have thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it!</li>
            <li> I have very long, VERY thick hair, and usually it takes about an hour and half  to dry my hair, with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer boasts of some neat features but is very average in performance.  </li>
            <li> but it kinda leaves my hair frizzy and not smooth</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> This one dried my hair in literally about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair</li>
            <li> So, I had to get rid of it because cold air does not work well to dry my long hair.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the end is oval which makes using a diffuser next to impossible.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a huge issue for me, but if you&#x27;re blow drying on hard wood or tile</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference or not)</li>
            <li> I as the consumer should not have to pay for the warranty of a product that failed to even last a year.</li>
            <li> We already have a small 1875 watt travel blow dryer but my son is using it now.  </li>
            <li> It does not burn me like other hair dryers, it does not frizz my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I get so frustrated buying hair dryers in the store only to have them not work or seem not worth the price.</li>
            <li> so its hard to find a dryer that wone FRY my hair...</li>
            <li> Other buyers, please be aware of this companies horrible warranty service.</li>
            <li> One word of caution - if you have arthritis, the controls may be hard for you to use.  </li>
            <li> it blew only cold air.</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I call Helen of Troy products to make a complaint.  </li>
            <li> I now needed to find a replacement hair dryer, something impossible to do on a Holiday when all the stores are closed and you need to be somewhere in half</li>
            <li> Oh, by the way, my Hot Tools Hair Dryer doesn&#x27;t look too bad chained to the wall in our bathroom!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write bad reviews, but my last blow dryer lasted me over 5 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but seriously, I&#x27;m that sold on this blow dryer and think everyone should know.  </li>
            <li> but seriously, I&#x27;m that sold on this blow dryer and think everyone should know.  </li>
            <li> It makes it look too thin and straggly.</li>
            <li> I used this dryer (6 days a week/20minute sessions) for just over 9 years before it \\&quot;retired\\&quot; from a broken wire.  </li>
            <li> SO FRUSTRATING.</li>
            <li> The dryer is poorly made.  </li>
            <li> So frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively thin hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing dramatic frizz reduction or anything</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the tip of the nozzle is melting.  </li>
            <li> This model was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The warranty (though very lame) is for a year, so I called</li>
            <li> The dryer not so bad but</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again :(</li>
            <li> One thing that stinks, though, is that the concentrator piece on the end of the hairdryer comes off every now and then and it can become very annoying.</li>
            <li> I thought she would hate it.</li>
            <li> Very Annoying :(</li>
            <li> Hated to lose it, but had to give away.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very annoying!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> When my previous dryer crapped out, I searched for it and replaced it with the same model.  I love it.  The first time I used it I could tell the difference the ions made - my hair felt smoother.  I love the varied settings for heat and strength, and the cool shot is nice too.  If #2 goes, I&#x27;ll probably look for it again.</li>
            <li> I have this for a few days and already ordering something new. The nozzle comes off while blow drying hair</li>
            <li> Very light &amp; dries hair quickly without frizz.</li>
            <li> Well what can I say, other then this dryer is terrific.......its fairly quiet, compared to other dryers I\\&quot;ve had.  it drys my hair very quickly......&lt;br /&gt;and really helps me style it well........I like it so much, I also purchased the travel version. I highly reccomend it.......</li>
            <li> Got this hair dryer after my Hot tools pink zebra one broke. While it&#x27;s not as cute it does dry my hair better. I am loving how light weight it is, I have long hair and sometimes my arm gets tired from being up in the air that long. But this blow dryer is very light weight and packs a punch too! It dries my hair pretty fast and cuts out some of the frizz with the ions. Overall I love it!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product yesterday and used it first thing this morning.  I turned it on to high and the on/air flow button broke.  It is stuck on high and just slides up and down.  I had to un-plug it and re-plug it into the outlet to use it this morning.  This is made cheaply and is junk, do not spend your money on this dryer.</li>
            <li> Kinda cheap looking and kinda loud</li>
            <li> I love the long cord (8ft) but the vent keeps coming off and it will only point in one direction. I plan to send it back.</li>
            <li> My hair is superfine, and in the winter when it gets all staticky it makes me nuts.  I wind up putting it in a ponytail most of the time because I can&#x27;t stand the static.  Aveda used to make a wonderful product that really took that static out but they don&#x27;t make it anymore and none of the others I tried worked either.  I really didn&#x27;t think a blow dryer could make a difference, and I&#x27;ve only used this a few times since I got it (and I use it with the diffuser on it so I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference or not) but it REALLY doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with any static.  Mind you, it doesn&#x27;t take all the frizz out of my hair (it starts off looking just fine but kind of frizzes as the day wears on) but I bought it for the anti-static, and I&#x27;m really pleased with that aspect of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she borrowed one like this while staying with a friend and loved it.  Good power, multiple heat settings, and doesn&#x27;t have that motor wind that some put out that drive you crazy.  The vent poece on the back is removeable for cleaning out lint that gets trapped in there... this is a great feature and should improve the life expectancy of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Nozzle does Not Stay on or Spins Around...Very Annoying :(</li>
            <li> I was happy with this dryer for about the first week, after which Low speed no longer worked and it was stuck on High all the time.  It sounds like a few other reviewers have had this same issue.  I would not recommend this product, and am going to buy the Helen of Troy Professional Ceramic Hair Dryer (which I&#x27;ve used at my gym and works great, and seems to be a higher quality product) instead.</li>
            <li> Six months later low blower speed doesn&#x27;t work at all. However, the heating elements heat up to maximum with no airflow. Would seem to be a fire hazard. Certainly, the outside of the barrel of the unit gets extremely hot to the touch very quickly and continues to get hotter until you turn it off or to high blower speed. At high blower speed the heating elements turn off even when set on high temp and all you get is cold air.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking for high heat with no air flow... or ...no heat with high air flow, this is the blow dryer for you.</li>
            <li> got this for over a month now. It is working great. I usually do not dry my hair, but living in NE there are a lot of snow days in the winter. I need to dry my hair before I head out. I am very satisfied with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> works well the only problem is the tip wont stay on</li>
            <li> Product came quickly but not sure I&#x27;d buy it again. The attachment falls off very easily.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair dryers I have used.  It was reasonably priced and dried my hair faster than any other dryer I have used.  Other dryers left my hair feeling dull, dried out, and full of static.  This dryer leaves my smooth and shiny!  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight hair that normaly takes forever to dry. This drier works fast on my hair, and with minimal frizz. I use a round brush to curl the ends under, the multiple settings on the drier works great for this type of styling. It is also quieter than other driers i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have thick Asian hair and it dries it quickly and my hair is also nice and slick not frizzy.  With other hairdryers you have to turn up the heat where the hairdryer sometimes smells like it&#x27;s burning and you hair smells burnt, but with this hairdryer, none of those problems.  Absolutely love it, going to buy a second one.</li>
            <li> This product is of good quality.  It&#x27;s lightweight, the cord is long, it&#x27;s a little quieter than my previous hair dryer.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that when I use the hottest setting,it&#x27;s not as hot as I would like it.</li>
            <li> I love it, of course my husband used it before I did.  It does not burn me like other hair dryers, it does not frizz my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this blowdryer! It not heavy... doesnt create alot of heat to damage the hair... Im African American so its hard to find a dryer that wone FRY my hair... it leaves it feeling light and airy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this hair dryer to meet my needs drying my longer hair, and it&#x27;s a much appreciated lighter weight than my last one. However, I do wish it was a little quieter on high speed, or else have a medium speed setting to select.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my hair. One thing that stinks, though, is that the concentrator piece on the end of the hairdryer comes off every now and then and it can become very annoying.</li>
            <li> Purchased this hair dryer a couple of months ago and absolutely love it.  I&#x27;m a mother of four under the age of 6, which allows me only a few minutes to get ready.  Typically I would just grab a hat and go .. but not now .. finally I can actually feel good about the looks of my hair before heading out the door.  The only draw back for me was the cool shot could be cooler, besides that thank you for a great prodcut Hot Tools!</li>
            <li> I am a Hair Stylist and I was looking for a lightweight hair dryer. This is an OK hair dryer. It dries pretty good. A couple things I dislike are that it&#x27;s very loud and the attachment does not stay on well. I will not use this dryer on clients but I will for home use.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this hairdryer until it broke on me the fourth time using it!  I would advise you not to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hair dryer connoisseur, and I have 100% curly hair and just wanted it to dry my hair before I flat iron it occasionally but it kinda leaves my hair frizzy and not smooth like it says ~ I can only compare it to my roommates Conair hair dryer that I seemed to get a better result with.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair dryer after using a similar one at an upscale hotel.  I have thick hair and needed a dryer that would work quickly. I have not been disappointed. The dryer is lightweight for its size and speedily dries my hair.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is light yet powerful.  My first one lasted over 15 years, I&#x27;m hoping this one lasts as long or longer!</li>
            <li> Received the item quickly. It is just as it was described.</li>
            <li> This is a good blow dryer, but less then a year later it broke.  I hardly ever write bad reviews, but my last blow dryer lasted me over 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;So I would recommend a blow dryer that cost a little more, because you&#x27;ll end up spending more money having to buy another one in a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a year ago, used it 5 to 6 times a week to dry my short hair, and kept the dust/lint trap clean regularly. Loved this dryer and it dried my hair quickly. However, after barely a year, suddenly it blew nothing hotter than luke-warm air. I put up with this for a couple of weeks until one day it blew only cold air. Very disappointing, as I&#x27;d really liked everything else about this dryer. It&#x27;s now been replaced with a lesser but more dependable brand until I can find something comparable. Look elsewhere or expect a limited product lifespan.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I purchased this in October 2013 - today is May of 2017 and this dryer STILL works!  I can tell it is about to go out, so I&#x27;m price shopping for another one.  However, I&#x27;ve used this on average 3-5 times a week.  This has lasted much better than my top of the line Chi ever thought about giving me, and I will definitely look for this brand again (if not purchase this exact one again!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the sister of a very sweet cosmetologist, she always makes sure I have the absolute BEST of anything hair related - shampoo, conditioner, flat iron, curling iron, blow dryer, etc.  With that, I had a Chi blow dryer, top of the line, ionic, you name it, it had it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have thick, long hair.  But it takes forever to dry, so I had used it very LIGHTLY for 1 year and 3 months before something went bad and it no longer heated (a very common problem).  Let me stop here and clarify light use on thick hair - I wash my hair about every other day.  I would use the Chi to dry my bangs (short) and just the very top roots, not even the top layer, just the roots.  Sometimes at night, I wouldn&#x27;t use the dryer at all and let my hair air dry then use the curling/straight iron the next morning.  It probably had an average use of 10 minutes a week.  The warranty (though very lame) is for a year, so I called and they were basically no help (barely understood English).  I thought after all the money spent on Chi&#x27;s (and how many my sister had sold for them), they would be of SOME help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t spend money on a Chi again, just to have it go out with very light use in just over a year.  So I go to trusty Amazon for reviews... now, I can&#x27;t buy a no-name brand because everyone who comes to my house expects me to have the best in hair care products (even my mother in law commented on how I have the best &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and she loves excuses to stay and use my shampoo and conditioner lol).  So I found this one, a professional brand, I love my Hot Tools curling iron, with BETTER reviews than the Chi, Helen Of Troy, and all the other high ones - but with all the features.  Plus, I can order 4+ of these for the same price as one junky Chi - so I&#x27;m not in tears if it goes out in a year.  Of course, I place the order still terrified, &amp;#34;What if it&#x27;s not as good as my Chi???&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 3 weeks.  And to kick it all, I like it BETTER than the Chi!!!  It will actually dry my full thick, long head of hair straight out of the shower in 10 minutes tops.  Which is wonderful, since I have a 7 month old and now I can go to bed with dry hair without spending all night trying to dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it sounds like I am a paid advertiser for them.... but seriously, I&#x27;m that sold on this blow dryer and think everyone should know.  Adios Chi brand...han the Chi!!!  It will actually dry my full thick, long head of hair straight out of the shower in 10 minutes tops.  Which is wonderful, since I have a 7 month old and now I can go to bed with dry hair without spending all night trying to dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it sounds like I am a paid advertiser for them.... but seriously, I&#x27;m that sold on this blow dryer and think everyone should know.  Adios Chi brand...</li>
            <li> I have a &amp;#34;no frills&amp;#34; hairstyle (long, naturally straight and fine) that can air-dry and still look okay.  Therefore, I have never been one to spend a lot of money on styling tools.  I bought this very basic, inexpensive hair dryer since I normally don&#x27;t have time for air-drying.  It worked &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; for the past 2 years--it dried my hair in about 10 minutes but left lots of little frizzes on top that I would then have to smooth out with an iron.  It just met the bare minimum requirements for a hair dryer, nothing more.  I cleaned the lint filter regularly and only used it a few times a week.  I was therefore surprised when it shot out sparks and smoke while using it yesterday morning.  I carefully unplugged it and disposed of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always heard that with hairdryers, you actually do get what you pay for but I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with it.  However, since the performance of this hairdryer was nothing special and it didn&#x27;t last very long, I guess it is time for at least a modest upgrade with my next hairdryer.  I am wishing now I had just bought a nicer one to begin with as I will be out the same amount of money, having to replace it so soon.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. It dries very fast and accurately. I love the 3 heat settings and 3 drying levels. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this in April 2006 (six years ago), and again just now.  That&#x27;s how long the last one lasted.  It worked great, I never had any problems with it, I never hit a button by mistake, never caught my hair in the back like others, it&#x27;s not as loud as others I have owned, the cord is longer than some, it has a nice attachment, good buttons to choose from, and a nice little rubber nub on each side so that it doesn&#x27;t slide off the counter, too.  After the last one died (stopped blowing heated air), I snipped off the cord and gave it to my son to play pretend with, and he spent the next 10 minutes pounding it on the floor like a hammer, with no damage to the body, if you&#x27;re worried about dropping it.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, has a good-shaped grip, and it&#x27;s just the right proportion to style with (not a short nozzle or weird handle that you have to compensate for).  I had the option to buy another hair dryer, and went with the same one again, after going over many others that were more expensive or were different.  This hair dryer works.  So it&#x27;s the one I bought.  Now all I can hope for is that it lasts me another (almost) six years.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  It is easy to handle, comfortable to hold, and has multiple controls for varying speed and temperature.  My hair drys faster with this model than with any other brand I have ever used, and it styles my hair beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t in the market for a new hair dryer but, thanks to my husband, who deep sixed my old one using it to thaw frozen water pipes at our cabin, I needed a new one. He thought the dryer just needed to &#x27;rest&#x27; for a bit and then it would be &#x27;fine&#x27; . . . so he didn&#x27;t bother to tell me it had blown its last burst of air under our kitchen sink! I now needed to find a replacement hair dryer, something impossible to do on a Holiday when all the stores are closed and you need to be somewhere in half an hour!&lt;br /&gt;FYI: If you, too, have a husband who has to thaw water pipes and has used your hair dryer, for that purpose, I suggest you point him in the direction of the [[ASIN:B00004TI25 Milwaukee 6 Dual Temperature Heat Gun]]. If he takes the hint you can avoid having to go to a &#x27;Very Important Family Event&#x27; scaring small children (and some adults, I might add!) looking like a demented survivor from a shipwreck! I still cannot fathom why steam coming out of my ears and fire from the burning coals in my eyes didn&#x27;t dry my hair! Where was a hot flash when I needed one? I&#x27;m over it - or I will be as soon as all the pictures and negatives have been destroyed! However, I digress, so back to my review.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I selected this hair dryer. It has proved to be an excellent choice. Dries my hair much faster and seems to leave it silkier which is saying a lot since I have gray hair that has a mind of its own. Oh, by the way, my Hot Tools Hair Dryer doesn&#x27;t look too bad chained to the wall in our bathroom! ~ Mrs. B.</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with this hair dryer. I blow dry my hair out to straighten most of the time, but noticed with this dryer it makes it too soft and too straight. It makes it look too thin and straggly. and it definitely does NOT eliminate static. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I order this as a birthday gift and while the blow dryer is great the actual package was torn up! This was a birthday gift and it wasn&#x27;t the best presentation... It looked like someone had sat on the blow dryer box before packaging it in the brown delivery box...</li>
            <li> I first tried this dryer at my sisters and then bought one!  I just love it!  It is easy to use and really dries my hair but doesn&#x27;t dry it out!  It gives my hair a tone of volume!  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my college bound daughter, she has been extremely pleased with the dryer.  She claims that it does dry her hair faster and with less frizz. The dryer has only been in use for one month but seems to be solid and dependable.  The weight of the unit has not been an issue, as some have previously stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sept 2010 Update - This unit is still blowing and going.  Used on a regular basis the dryer has performed wonderfully since purchasing it in August 2006. My daughter was so thrilled with her dryer that I purchased the same model for myself and it has been in use for over 2 years.  If either died tomorrow, we would be hard pressed to replace it with a different model.</li>
            <li> Good dryer, very simple and has a nice combination of settings. Drys hair very fast with no frizz - even in Winter. Liked the first one so much I bought a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I thought it worth updating this review, as it has been nearly 5 years since I purchased two of these dryers, and they are still going strong with daily use! One of the things that I have come to really appreciate about this dryer is that the low fan setting truly is low. So many other dryers give you \\&quot;high\\&quot; and \\&quot;higher\\&quot; as choices. I don&#x27;t want to achieve the \\&quot;head out the car window look\\&quot;, I want just enough airflow to get the job done. Of course, there is a high setting if you do want more. The other noteworthy thing is that cleaning lint out of the dryer is so easy! The lint screen removes very easily and can be cleaned in seconds and replaced. This helps keep the unit working efficiently and adds to its life.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it&#x27;s going to do at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me a really long time to dry my hair, and when I do it gets really frizzy and dry.  This hair dryer dries my hair much faster and my hair doesn&#x27;t begin to stick to the surfaces around me.  My hair dries like it normally would air-drying, only a lot faster.  Great anti-static hairdryer!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for myself for my birthday in June and here 3 1/2 months later the heating element doesn&#x27;t work.  I loved this blow dryer and now here i am completely unhappy.  This should have lasted longer. And now they won&#x27;t warranty this item, I am out of a blow dryer.  It would be nice if people can stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> This works great and has really helped cut down on my static! Also-my hair feels SO MUCH better now that I am not using my cheapie blow dryer!</li>
            <li> It dries all this hair really fast.  Very light.  Bigger than I thought due to it&#x27;s weight but it works.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few years ago.  It has lasted very well under heavy use.  I am a repeat buyer.  Why try anything else?</li>
            <li> I just bought this blowdryer a week ago, and I admit that it works great on my very frizzy hair!  The problem?  It broke the 2nd time I used it.  The on/off button broke and so I can&#x27;t turn it off.  It&#x27;s stuck on high.  Definitely not worth it!</li>
            <li> I already own 3 different hair dryers from this brand. Love them and will never go for anything less than that quality.</li>
            <li> I used this dryer (6 days a week/20minute sessions) for just over 9 years before it \\&quot;retired\\&quot; from a broken wire.  Needless to say, I have been very pleased with this particular hair dryer.  It&#x27;s nothing fancy but the fact that it gave me almost a decades use means I am strongly considering buying a replica.  The only complaint I have is that the end is oval which makes using a diffuser next to impossible.  However, if you are looking for an affordable dryer that will last, and don&#x27;t use/need a diffuser, I would recommend this particular Hot Tools dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. Especially because of the long cord. It&#x27;s pretty light and easy to handle.. Great value for what I paid!!!</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair that normally takes up to 20 minutes to dry.  I can honestly say that I can now do it in under 10 minutes flat.  This is one of the best hair dryers I have used and would recommend it with out hesitation.</li>
            <li> This professional dryer is just what it says, professional . I have had this model for several years and am still using it. I bought another one to have on hand. I love it . It is light weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> The styling tip does not stay on, keeps falling off in the middle of blow drying and then it&#x27;s too hot to put back</li>
            <li> This is the CHEAPEST HotTools product I&#x27;ve ever seen. When it arrived, it would only work on the high setting (while fluctuating between hot and cool). If I put it on the low setting, it would turn bright red inside and not blow any air (SCARY!). Ultimately, it stopped working all together after getting very hot and smelling like it was melting. Do not buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, Amazon was very good about refunding me and there wasn&#x27;t any issue on that end.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer completely died about 6 months after I bought it. STAY AWAY!!!!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer dries my hair in half the time my old one did. My hair is really curly and I like it better straight and this product has the power to make my hair nice and smooth without much effort. It has a cool blast switch to lock the style in place. I don&#x27;t have to use as much hair product because this blow dryer makes my hair straight with basically just a brush. If you have frizzy hair this is the blow dryer for you</li>
            <li> Dryer is powerful, much better than ones from drugstore that cost the same or more. Extension cord is very long.</li>
            <li> This dryer lasted me a year of using it about 5 times a week. Now the dryer won&#x27;t stay hot. It will get hot and stay hot for about 60 seconds and then it will flash green inside of the barrel and the air will turn cold. SO FRUSTRATING. I like this dryer when its functional because its light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased a more expensive model to see if i like it better. Maybe $30 dollars a year is what it costs to dry your hair?... we will see.</li>
            <li> I had not purchased a hair dryer in 14 years; I was still using my Mary Kate &amp; Ashley Olsen hair dryer from my youth.  Having worked at Ulta during college, I grew to love the Hot Tools products.  I was waiting to purchase this brand of hair dryer after using other Hot Tools styling tools when my hair dryer finally gave out.  On the day that my blow dryer finally died, I quickly purchased this model.  Sure, it has several speed and heat settings, but it&#x27;s nothing special.  My itty bitty hair dryer from 2000 did as good of a job as the ion/ceramic/multi-function hair dryers of present day.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to notice a difference in dryers until you really jump into a different price bracket with the T-3s and Chi&#x27;s.  i think I could have spend about $15 less and still achieved the same look and quality.  I have very long and thick hair, and unfortunately, the speed of drying has not changed even with a much newer and larger model than the one I chose to use 14 years ago.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is easy to use and dry&#x27;s your hair quickly. Great settings to chose from! The price is resonable!</li>
            <li> This dryer boasts of some neat features but is very average in performance.  I didn&#x27;t think it to be particularly excellent in any way.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> dryers my hair super fast and no frizz</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. Used this model for about 8 years. Yes the give out like all hair dryers and I have to buy a new one, but quality is always the same when I have to get a new one. Very powerful and dries hair quickley!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Hot Tools dryers in the past and I just love how lightweight they are.  I have very long hair and it takes me a good 10-15 minutes to dry my hair so lightweight is a must.  I use the low heat setting and it&#x27;s perfect.  Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> We ordered this as a Christmas gift on the recommendation of our stylist.  She spoke highly of the product and manufacturer.  However, upon opening, the dryer did not work on the High setting.  We will need to return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend last year for Christmas. A little less than a year later the hair dryer&#x27;s motor has malfunctioned. I called up the manufacturer, since it has a one year manufacturers warranty, and was told that they would replace it if I paid for the item to be shipped back and paid a $10 warranty replacement fee. I as the consumer should not have to pay for the warranty of a product that failed to even last a year. Other buyers, please be aware of this companies horrible warranty service.</li>
            <li> Very nice and easy to use.  Works great!</li>
            <li> This dryer is lightweight by very powerful.  It dries my hair very fast on a low setting so I have less breakage.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace my previous Hot Tools hair dryer that had broken after many years of use. This hair dryer is even better than my old one! It is much lighter and still has the same fast drying power of the last one. I take it everywhere because no other hair dryer can dry my long layered hair as quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I have really long think hair that can take a solid 30 minutes to dry with most hair dryers. After reading reviews for this product I decided to buy it and I am very satisfied with the speed at which it dries my hair. I spend about 10 minutes on the highest setting after I take a shower and my hair goes from dripping wet to almost completely dry. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t as fluffy after I blow dry it as it used to be with previous hair dryers. I definitely recommend this product. For the price, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product, was purchased for a gift for my granddaughter, she was excited. Thank you</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very light, quieter than some, but still pretty loud on high. I think the high fan setting is a bit fast for styling, but is good for drying hair quickly. The high / hot heat is hot! Overall I am satisfied with this dryer and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived when Amazon said that it would.</li>
            <li> great dryer, should have ordered two</li>
            <li> I have very long hair so it use to take me about 20 min to dry .  I read the reviews so I thought I would take a chance What a differece With this hair dryer it only took 5 min I could not believe it def not sending this one back</li>
            <li> Had this blow dryer for less then 2 weeks and it stopped blowing hot air.  I got this dryer because I had another one from this maker and loved it.  This model was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I used this thing exactly once. In the space of twenty minutes it fell apart twenty times.</li>
            <li> The best hair dryer.  In fact this was a replacement for the one I had for ten years</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace my old Hot Tools hair dryer. Hot Tools hair dryers last longer than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned. This is a great hair dryer. It dries quickly and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. The dryer is poorly made.  The nozzle flies off about 3-4 times while I&#x27;m drying my hair.  It&#x27;s very annoying!  I will most likely return.</li>
            <li> The dryer not so bad but the filter on the back and the directional nozzle WILL NOT STAY ON!  I mean really will not stay on.  So frustrating.  Don&#x27;t buy this!  I stupidly tried it only once waiting for my current one to die completely and now I missed the window to return.  Ugh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for about 2 months and I love it.  It has plenty of power and gets my hair dry in record time.</li>
            <li> It was not quiet and not fast. The supposed ionic function is a bunch of hooey. Fine, for the price I could just say, \\&quot;whatever.\\&quot; The ion thing was just a sales gimmick I fell for. Unfortunately, after a year of moderate use it suddenly developed a stench and then died in about 30 seconds. No, it wasn&#x27;t clogged with hair or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer after using my mom&#x27;s similar dryer and reading the reviews for this one. I totally love it. I have very thick long hair and it took close to an hour to fully blow dry my hair with my old conair dryer. This one dried my hair in literally about 5 minutes. It is also very light. I wish it was a tax quieter but overall I am more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have very long, VERY thick hair, and usually it takes about an hour and half  to dry my hair, with a blow dryer. Well, with this dryer, it literlay takes under 20 minutes!!!! I was soooo surprised the first time I used it. Would 100% buy this item again. Best Christmas present EVER!</li>
            <li> Fast, doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t weaken over time. Love it! My grandmother is a professional hair dresser and she recommended this for personal, at-home use due to a good blend of price and quality.</li>
            <li> didnt really like it. the concentrator melted a bit where it attaches to the blow dryer and wont stay on, plus it was stationary and could not be rotated as needed.</li>
            <li> I love how light weight this hair dryer is, and how quick it gets my hair dry!  I have curly hair and it does not make it frizz.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I liked this hair dryer while it worked. It was light and didn&#x27;t tire my arm or wrist, it got hot enough to dry my hair, and it wasn&#x27;t extremely loud like a lot of dryers are. However, after a month and a half of using it once every day for about 15 mins, it stopped blowing hot air. It still blew air and everything perfectly, it just stopped heating the air. So, I had to get rid of it because cold air does not work well to dry my long hair. I think it might have just been a lemon, because I know sometimes there&#x27;s just going to be defective items in a group. Amazon customer service was quick to help me though, and I was able to get a refund.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer, transaction went smooth.  Would order again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good hair dryer the attachment just won&#x27;t stay on 😒</li>
            <li> Dries my long hair really quickly. Very lightweight. I like that it has several settings so I have choices on strength and heat level.</li>
            <li> I like that the speed of the blower is separate from the heat selection.</li>
            <li> This item was a great price and I was very happy with it for the first few uses.  It dries my hair in half the time that I was spending with a drugstore brand.  Unfortunately, the tip of the nozzle is melting.  It may be because it&#x27;s made out of lightweight plastic.  Real bummer as I was so thrilled with its performance.</li>
            <li> Upon first use, this item did not blow hot air. On the low flow airflow setting, it blew vaguely warm. On the high airflow setting, it blew cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When set to low heat, it didn&#x27;t even pretend.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery, product is not as good as I expected. Not very powerful, although it does dry hair fast. I figured the watts at 1875 would be as strong as my old conair. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again :(</li>
            <li> From the description I expected this dryer to be smaller and lighter than it was. But the performance is good.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and it is not &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34;, so when I go outside on a humid day, the places where my hair is naturally curly curl up worse and the rest loses the style I intended when I left the house. Static was a big issue, so when shopping for a blower with high wattage, high heat (yes, I want HOT) and high velocity, I found this one hoping it would meet the requirements. I found it to be like most of the drug-store blowers in my blower-graveyard in the closet, going to the next garage sale. I just did not meet the expectations, not enough blow, heat and I still had frizzy static hair. It works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don&#x27;t want to damage, but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style. I did move on and purchased Onei MK-II for about $70 taking a really big chance. It blew me away literally and exceeded all expectations. So for fine hair users, it may be worthwhile to shop around since there are very few resources for our types.</li>
            <li> Did not like this at all. My hair took longer to dry and it was so loud!!! Returned immediately</li>
            <li> Purchased product 9/7/2012.  By 4/6/2013, the product does not work.  The dryer is not overused - 2 times per week, maximum.  I call Helen of Troy products to make a complaint.  I have to pay the cost of shipping the product back to them and wait a minimum of two weeks for them to return a replacement to me.</li>
            <li> A replacement for my old Elchim.  My only complaint of this dryer is that the nozzle doesn&#x27;t stay on very well once it heats up.  This is a typical problem for dryers and I&#x27;ve come to expect it, even from more expensive ones.  I get ready in a carpeted area so it&#x27;s not a huge issue for me, but if you&#x27;re blow drying on hard wood or tile, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this dryer because you&#x27;ll spend more time hunting down the nozzle than actually drying your hair.  Other than that, it is light weight and has cut my dry time down about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It takes a few seconds to get the hot air and the plastic attachments fall off. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> My trusty Hot Tools dryer that I bought from Ulta died on me after two years of daily use...so I decided to get this one given the reviews. This is a lot lighter than my previous one but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same power and oomph Hot Tools Pink Dragon Ionic Hair Dryer had...it still gets the job done tho...The only thing I&#x27;d say sucks is that it doesnt come with a diffuser and the nozzle is an odd oval shape it&#x27;s not like I can buy a universal diffuser to fit it. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> The Heat guard attachment constantly pops off &amp; there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very lightweight, plus has all kinds of features and speeds. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really liked this blow-dryer until it gave out after 10 months of very light use. I probably used it on average 2x a week for those 10 months, then it died. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR HOME USE !!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and definitely dries quicker than my old dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer works great.  One word of caution - if you have arthritis, the controls may be hard for you to use.  Hated to lose it, but had to give away.  Couldn&#x27;t push the soft-touch buttons down without pain in my fingers.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> I get so frustrated buying hair dryers in the store only to have them not work or seem not worth the price. This was a great price and works great, and has all the features I wanted!</li>
            <li> I am LOVING this blow dryer! My hair feels so soft and looks much more shiny!!!! I&#x27;m hoping it isnt like the other reviews and doesnt break in a few weeks bc I love this brand and will never buy another cheap Walmart brand!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good, but ony lasted a year.  Didn&#x27;t re-purchase, going back to Remington.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer after reading the reviews. I was going to buy a more expensive one but after reading the reviews decided to give this a try. It was worth it! It works better than a more expensive one I had prior to this one. It dries my hair very quickly and gives it a nice full body look. I highly recommend this hair dryer- for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for a couple weeks and I feel good about my purchase. I&#x27;m not seeing dramatic frizz reduction or anything but it does seem to have helped  a bit with my flyaway prone hair. I can definitely say that it is faster than my old dryer, and I&#x27;m amazed at how quiet it is!  I wish it was a bit smaller as it is sort of hard to store but other than that I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thin hair and this took forever to dry it! I wound up returning it after one use!</li>
            <li> REally works well, lots of power, good dials/settings, and not to loud.  Love the long cord too.</li>
            <li> Love it and it is so light weight</li>
            <li> It is the best hair dryer!</li>
            <li> My widfe loves he long cord and the temperature settings, no longer burning her hair</li>
            <li> Always go for the Hot Tools as the professionals use this product and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this blow dryer and flat iron at the same time for my own personal use.  This came shortly after retiring my previously used items after four+ years of use.  While the flat iron is still working fine, the blow dryer quit working approximately 50 days after purchase.  I am presently writing the manufacturer and will update this if I receive a response.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a faster drying, and more quiet hair dryer.  My husband always complains about me blow drying my hair in the mornings before he gets up. In all honesty, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this one, and my previous $10 Revlon one from Walmart. It takes the same amount of time to dry my hair, and to me, it doesn&#x27;t seem any quieter.  I do like the IDEA of the Ions leaving your hair less staticy and healthier, but I don&#x27;t know that I can really tell the difference. My husband hasn&#x27;t been complaining about the noise as much, but I don&#x27;t know if its because he knows I bought a new hair dryer trying to please him, or if it&#x27;s actually a lower frequency. To me, with it up close to my head, I can&#x27;t tell a difference.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful light weight fast drying blow dryer.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a professional type product without the high cost.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Fast and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  The anti-static feature is great, especially for dry hair.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer, real light weight, easy to handle</li>
            <li> We already have a small 1875 watt travel blow dryer but my son is using it now.  So we needed a second one in the house.  This one has lots of features--multi temperature settings and strengths.  But at full force and the hottest setting, it is not as powerful as our smaller travel blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. I thought she would hate it. She always complained how long it took to dry her hair, and I couldn&#x27;t think of much else to get her. She absolutely raves how much she loves it, and how much quicker it takes her to get ready.</li>
            <li> I got this dryer in 2003 and have used it every single day on my long hair. Just this week (Jan 2013) it decided to break. I smelled something like melting plastic and I thought I just needed to clean the vent. I cleaned it but that wasn&#x27;t it. The dryer doesn&#x27;t get hot anymore. I figure 10 years of great service it worth $26 to buy the exact same one again. This dryer gets my hair dry quickly and painlessly. It was the best dryer I have ever used. Time to repurchsae it!</li>
