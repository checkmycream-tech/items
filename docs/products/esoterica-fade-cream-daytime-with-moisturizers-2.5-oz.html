            <li>After reading reviews on other places I purchased it for my mom, (had her face all covered up by marcs after her pregnancies) and come to say it works WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Esoterica for years, and I was so excited to find the daytime one after years of not being able to find it.</li>

            <li>Only used it during the day and took the whole jar.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream for my mom, she so far loves it.</li>
            <li>I know when I use it that I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out, and it erases old acne or pregnancy blemishes/dark spots.</li>
            <li>I used it in some intimate places and it is now fading back to its pretty pink self.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination, but usually dry skin.</li>

            <li> Like with all products of its kind, you&#x27;re not going to get instant results. But for me, this one is the best I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few).&lt;br /&gt;I started seing results at the 2nd. week. You just have to be a little pacient and give it time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item while surfing the web, I actually had nothing to do. After reading reviews on other places I purchased it for my mom, (had her face all covered up by marcs after her pregnancies) and come to say it works WONDERFUL! She&#x27;s been using it for 3-4 weeks already and I need to say, THEY HAVE ALMOST DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY! And that&#x27;s of course only using it at night. Imagine what would do if using the night and day cream... I rate this 5 stars, pretty well earned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Esoterica Fade Cream for almost 30 years. It has kept all the brown spots away on both my face and hands. Nothing else compares to it.</li>
            <li> Great cream and the price was great too!</li>
            <li> on tome and good product</li>
            <li> It helps some, and like the moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 months now, day and night.  I still have not noticed any difference.  Not sure how it works for the other reviewers, but for me it just doesn&#x27;t do anything.  Please note I have already gone through half of this and still no differnce.</li>
            <li> I had marks on my face and blackheads and since I started using this cream for about a month, and they have disappeared. I am so happy I use this product because it is so magical.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment very quickly. I gave it a 3 because I have not noticed any lightening of my age spot. But, it does moisturizer nicely.:)</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it was always good for my skin.  It is a great product to use.  It had become very hard for me to find so I had to order online. Both daytime and nighttime works well together and you get good results.  The product is just wonderful and I love it.  The results are fantastic, try it and you will agree.  GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li> This brand doesn&#x27;t look or work like it did in the 90&#x27;s. I was so happy when I found it on amazon, only for it to break me out and not fade anything.</li>
            <li> Ok was not expecting too much but...It worked for me, and definetely see a huge difference used twice. It took it to a very perfect blend.  I used it in some intimate places and it is now fading back to its pretty pink self.  I had to be real!</li>
            <li> Its what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I had used this item before with success but could not find it in stores.  If you are younger, it fades spots better than when you are my age, but it still works.</li>
            <li> If I had used the day and night cream together my age spots would have faded faster. Only used it during the day and took the whole jar. Faded but didn&#x27;t remove but am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my mom, she so far loves it. She had dark sun marks on her cheeks,  she tried everything &amp; nothing. She&#x27;s been using it for a month &amp; she loves it! It has a nice lavender scent to it which is great.</li>
            <li> Bad creammmmmmm.Dont work. never see something diferent.i will never recomend this cream.So sad i spend my money .never again.bad bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Esoterica for years, and I was so excited to find the daytime one after years of not being able to find it. I don&#x27;t know why, but stores just don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore or it&#x27;s just very hard to locate. My Grandma has used it since she was very young, and introduced it to me when I was a teenager. Her skin has always been flawless. There have been times when I haven&#x27;t been able to find my Esoterica, but when ever I use it my skin is also flawless. I know when I use it that I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out, and it erases old acne or pregnancy blemishes/dark spots. No matter what climate I&#x27;ve lived in, humid or dry, Esoterica never fails! I have sensitive combination, but usually dry skin. Esoterica always makes me feel good about my skin and look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;P.s. Btw, this has always worked for me. It worked when I had combination oily/dry skin as a teenager and even now as an adult with dry skin (dry skin due to the dry climate I live in). Thankfully, I now have my Esoterica, my face stays perfectly hydrated and pretty in this horrid dry weather. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my mother she&#x27;s been using this product for years.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, I glad it made my mom happy.</li>
            <li> Will be placing a order again this week.Very Pleased!</li>
