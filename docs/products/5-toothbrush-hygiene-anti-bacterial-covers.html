            <li>perfect; I use it daily.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>have one I use in my purse - no nasty  bits on toothbrush - yeah!</li>
            <li>Covers from nastiness, keeps the tooth brushes clean and almost germ free!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this is a better (more secure) option for traveling.</li>
            <li>They are very good for traveling, especially because they are Anti-Bacterial.</li>
            <li>you are going to sell ME a sanitary item, Amazon... please make sure that it arrives to me in its original packaging and has not been exposed to whatever germs are hanging around some dental office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good so far!</li>
            <li>but they were cheap</li>
            <li>I like the colors and the comfortable fit around the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>All in the household have one and occassionally I take them and wash them with warm water and soap then back to covering the head of our toothbrushes :)</li>
            <li>They are easy to open from the side and love the colors .</li>
            <li>It was not even worth my effort to print out a return label, repackage the items, and leave them out for UPS to pick up.  </li>
            <li>I do wish people would review more professionally.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I thought they would fit my different toothbrush heads better.  </li>
            <li>Works nicely, hoped there were bigger sizes to store my tongue cleaner as well</li>
            <li>whole experience was HIGHLY offensive to me!!!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>They cover the entire head rather than just the top as the Sonicare ones do.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Do you really think I trust that these are hygienic or antibacterial, when they have no packaging on them and have been handled?  </li>
            <li>Do you really think I would take these and put them on my toothbrush</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether these covers are really anti-bacterial, but they prevent whatever&#x27;s in the air from landing on my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>They snap and stay on very well.</li>
            <li>They fit my standard toothbush well.</li>
            <li>Not very expensive and easy to keep it closed for travel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rather than go through the same with this item, I contacted the seller directly and indicated that I would like to return them at my own expense, since it was only a 5 dollar product.  </li>
            <li>but I have TWICE gotten staff infections at dental offices, and I&#x27;m highly allergic to latex.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure why there were other emotional reviews - almost stopped me from trying these.</li>
            <li>I bought two many years ago, lost one but continued to use the other until I ordered these because finally one of the hinges broke on the old one.  </li>
            <li>They work, keeping my toothbrushes clean and giving them enough air circulation to dry.</li>
            <li>The new ones seem to be the same high quality and the design seems not to have changed at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem I have found with your product is it won&#x27;t work on my new battery operated Oral B toothbrush that I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>Really like the fact there are different colors - helps keep everyone&#x27;s toothbrushes from getting mixed up.</li>
            <li>I order something that says \\&quot;hygiene anti-bacterial,\\&quot; that has no other description.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter if other people flush without putting the toilet lid down first,  but better safe than sorry.  </li>
            <li>Apparently Amazon did not agree that they should pay for return shipping on these items...</li>
            <li>aware these do not fit on some electric toothbrushes.  </li>

            <li> Apparently Amazon did not agree that they should pay for return shipping on these items...</li>
            <li> aware these do not fit on some electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> but I found that I would prefer to just slip the cover over the tooth brush rather than having to snap it closed and then snap it back open when using this in my bathroom at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However if you travel with these you have to be careful how you pack the toothbrush or the covers can come open and then the toothbrush head isn&#x27;t covered at all.</li>
            <li> So is the dental office NOW going to get these back and resell them to some other unsuspecting person who thinks that these are antibacterial and hygienic?  </li>
            <li> They take up less room than traditional toothbrush tubes for travel.</li>
            <li> What a waste of Earthly and human resources!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> None of them stay closed.</li>
            <li> I have returned several items recently that I thought were falsely advertised by Amazon.  </li>
            <li> There are other products, less satisfactory in design, for your electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> And I get 5 covers thrown LOOSE in a manilla envelope!!!  </li>
            <li> something that I have never experienced before in my entire 54 years of life.  </li>
            <li> These do not fit on my Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> these covers do not fit any toothbrushes that I own.....................regular and slim electric................</li>
            <li> These are a little small and rather chintzy but they do serve their purpose</li>
            <li> therefore,the quality of the product is poor and the extremely small size renders them useless</li>
            <li> Product FAIL</li>
            <li> sorry,</li>
            <li> and then a cold sore on my bottom lip,</li>
            <li> I am so over Amazon and its tolerance of false advertising!!  </li>
            <li> I am getting sooooo sick of this...</li>
            <li> This is outrageous.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A good value for the price. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> WARNING, this product is NOT what it claims to be!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, I was duped by a misleading title on Amazon!!!  I am getting sooooo sick of this... I order something that says \\&quot;hygiene anti-bacterial,\\&quot; that has no other description.  And I get 5 covers thrown LOOSE in a manilla envelope!!!  Are you kidding me?  No packaging?  These have been handled by someone?  Do you really think I trust that these are hygienic or antibacterial, when they have no packaging on them and have been handled?  Do you really think I would take these and put them on my toothbrush, that goes into my MOUTH?  This is outrageous.  I am so over Amazon and its tolerance of false advertising!!  Product FAIL, these are going back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also:  I have returned several items recently that I thought were falsely advertised by Amazon.  Apparently Amazon did not agree that they should pay for return shipping on these items... an email I received showed that they charged back almost 12 dollars for return shipping, on an item that costs only 15 dollars... leaving me with a refund of 3 dollars.  Had I known in advance that they were going to do that, I would have just kept the items and thrown them away, or given them away.  It was not even worth my effort to print out a return label, repackage the items, and leave them out for UPS to pick up.  What a waste of Earthly and human resources!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than go through the same with this item, I contacted the seller directly and indicated that I would like to return them at my own expense, since it was only a 5 dollar product.  They messaged me back saying that it should cost me about 2 bucks to return the items.  You would think they would say forget it, just throw them away.  No... So is the dental office NOW going to get these back and resell them to some other unsuspecting person who thinks that these are antibacterial and hygienic?  After I have handled them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dental office/seller claims that these come in packagesof 1,000 and they handle them with latex gloves.  My response... sorry, but I have TWICE gotten staff infections at dental offices, and I&#x27;m highly allergic to latex.  So neither of those impresses me.  And by the way, within hours of opening these, I got a fever and then a cold sore on my bottom lip, something that I have never experienced before in my entire 54 years of life.  So... coincidence???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to sell ME a sanitary item, Amazon... please make sure that it arrives to me in its original packaging and has not been exposed to whatever germs are hanging around some dental office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole experience was HIGHLY offensive to me!!!</li>
            <li> The cover doesnt close properly.</li>
            <li> I just got them in the mail today. They are very good for traveling, especially because they are Anti-Bacterial.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these covers! We keep our toothbrushes in these covers 24hrs a day...they&#x27;re also great for traveling. I would recommend these to family and friends!</li>
            <li> Perfect color coding for the whole family.</li>
            <li> They work, keeping my toothbrushes clean and giving them enough air circulation to dry.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised. I was concerned with the plastic hinges opening &amp; closing. Been using for 2 months. Good so far!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have found with your product is it won&#x27;t work on my new battery operated Oral B toothbrush that I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> Love how great these toothbrush covers work keeping germs away and also fit great on any toothbrush . They are easy to open from the side and love the colors . I recommend these to anyone and are great for traveling or just to use at home .</li>
            <li> None of them stay closed.</li>
            <li> Covers from nastiness, keeps the tooth brushes clean and almost germ free!! It does it&#x27;s job and the colors are nice too</li>
            <li> These are a little small and rather chintzy but they do serve their purpose</li>
            <li> These do not fit on my Oral B electric toothbrush. (I also didn&#x27;t receive the colors shown, but that doesn&#x27;t matter since it doesn&#x27;t work.)</li>
            <li> Great for certain shapes of toothbrushes and size</li>
            <li> these covers do not fit any toothbrushes that I own.....................regular and slim electric................therefore,the quality of the product is poor and the extremely small size renders them useless</li>
            <li> has been a great asset/accessory to our traveling totes...thanks!</li>
            <li> You need to hands to get the toothbrush in and out but they were cheap so I can deal. (You have to unclip it not just push/pull your toothbrush through the hole. )</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my Sonicare  Pro Results Brush Head. They cover the entire head rather than just the top as the Sonicare ones do. They snap on snugly and will not fall off. They are sturdy. I was looking for these so I do not have to lug around the Sonicare case for brush head protection while traveling. Just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why there were other emotional reviews - almost stopped me from trying these. I do wish people would review more professionally.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do.... which is protect the brush part of my toothbrush. Seem well made for what they are.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I thought they would fit my different toothbrush heads better.  And they did.  However if you travel with these you have to be careful how you pack the toothbrush or the covers can come open and then the toothbrush head isn&#x27;t covered at all.</li>
            <li> They are indeed tooth brush covers.  I would have been happier to see the packaged in factory sealed packages instead of a ziploc baggie. But they do what they need to do in the bathroom</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and I love these.  I bought two many years ago, lost one but continued to use the other until I ordered these because finally one of the hinges broke on the old one.  The new ones seem to be the same high quality and the design seems not to have changed at all.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I also keep one on my regular toothbrush in my bathroom at home.  Maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter if other people flush without putting the toilet lid down first,  but better safe than sorry.  I don&#x27;t know whether these covers are really anti-bacterial, but they prevent whatever&#x27;s in the air from landing on my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware these do not fit on some electric toothbrushes.  There are other products, less satisfactory in design, for your electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These will be great to identify everyone&#x27;s brushes. They snap and stay on very well. They take up less room than traditional toothbrush tubes for travel.</li>
            <li> This definitely serves the purpose. Not very expensive and easy to keep it closed for travel. My kid loves that this is colourful!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fir properly</li>
            <li> perfect; I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. It fits all my ORAL-Bs that as a family of 5 are different models. Everybody in my house is happy!</li>
            <li> Good, just what it says it is.</li>
            <li> Really like the fact there are different colors - helps keep everyone&#x27;s toothbrushes from getting mixed up. have one I use in my purse - no nasty  bits on toothbrush - yeah!</li>
            <li> I order these toothbrush covers all the time.  The colors are a plus and I would recommend these for anyone.</li>
            <li> Works nicely, hoped there were bigger sizes to store my tongue cleaner as well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but I found that I would prefer to just slip the cover over the tooth brush rather than having to snap it closed and then snap it back open when using this in my bathroom at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is a better (more secure) option for traveling.</li>
            <li> Just got these. They do not snap around our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> These are great,  I purchase these Anti-bacterial covers for my oral-b electrical toothbrush head, they fit perfectly once I open(expanded) the bottom piece, where the neck fits. I like the colors and the comfortable fit around the toothbrush head. Since you get 5 of them, my family members can select a colors they would like to cover their toothbrush head with.</li>
            <li> The price was great, they arrived by the estimated delivery date, and are just as described.  They fit my standard toothbush well.</li>
            <li> Love these, great idea. All in the household have one and occassionally I take them and wash them with warm water and soap then back to covering the head of our toothbrushes :)</li>
