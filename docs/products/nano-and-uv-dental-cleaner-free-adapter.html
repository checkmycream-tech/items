            <li>This product is easy to use and works great on my retainer.  </li>
            <li>He has liked using it since he got it.</li>
            <li>This cleaner is actually better than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Then I will joyfully say more.</li>
            <li>I love not having to use chemicals or cleaning agents.  </li>
            <li>and then you have much more room in the tub area to place appliances.  </li>
            <li>Works well, makes me feel as though it is oh so much more sanitary</li>
            <li>Is way better than denture tablets, easy to use (push of a button), no complaints for it.</li>
            <li>if I keep turning it on and off the uv light will come on</li>
            <li>Therefore, every morning, he places it in this unit to clean it.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to clean my dentures.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses this all the time to clean her mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>(so I just fill it with water and put it on the sonic clean + u.v. setting).</li>
            <li>the dental devices taste clean and fresh after cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I would love to hear from others if this is a standard noise problem for dental cleaners or is this just a cheaply made one!  </li>
            <li>I see the vibrations causing cool looking ripples on the waters surface and the goofy little light show is nice, but I was hoping for something to clean these things to save a few minutes in the morning routine.</li>
            <li>I ran it twice to see if a second run would do any better, but it still feels slimy from overnight use after two runs.</li>
            <li>I wish I had purchased the Nano &amp; UV Dental cleaner when it first came on the market.  </li>
            <li>Even for that, the cup in this unit is very tight-fitting.  </li>
            <li>It saves me so much time.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to use for my whitening trays (which I really use as bite plates to cushion my teeth when I clench them during sleep).</li>
            <li>Did not perform as advertised, or I did not read what they really were saying.</li>
            <li>If there is a unit available which is larger, that will be definitely preferred.</li>
            <li>The only problem with it is that its very noisy, almost hurts your ears.  </li>
            <li>I bought this unit mainly to clean my upper partial denture.</li>
            <li>The unit is way too small to fit dentures in it.  </li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;ve had this thing since december, over 9 months,  too expensive, rarely worked, uv light never comes</li>
            <li>I use this for my night guard and it fits ok, but not sure if it will be big enough for dentures.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was a little high, but there don&#x27;t seem to be any other products available to do the job.  </li>

            <li> When I complained they said I must have large teeth - NO.</li>
            <li> It works well for my lower plate, but it is far too small for the upper.</li>

            <li> Finally, opening the unit after cleaning is tricky and not easy.  </li>
            <li> and I am not positive if you are in fact supposed to run it without that tray.  </li>

            <li> I would have returned it but not worth spending the money to return.  </li>

            <li> Provides means for cleaning and storing a denture</li>
            <li> I use it on a night guard, removes all odors and any build-up on the guard from use. Is way better than denture tablets, easy to use (push of a button), no complaints for it. Saves me money in the long run as well.</li>
            <li> This cleaner is actually better than I thought it would be.  It came with an AC adapter so I can plug it in instead of messing with batteries.  But you can use batteries if you want.  And it has 2 buttons: one for UV only and one for UV and vibration.  I thought the price was a little high, but there don&#x27;t seem to be any other products available to do the job.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Purchased for the purpose of cleaning dentures. It works well for my lower plate, but it is far too small for the upper. company should not adversites for dentures if dentures do not fit! I&#x27;m going to have to find another and use this one for jewelry.</li>
            <li> I received this product few weeks ago. I bought this unit mainly to clean my upper partial denture. The product is very poorly designed.  For some unknown reason, the cup where you place your denture for cleaning is very small.  My partial denture is itself small in size.  Even for that, the cup in this unit is very tight-fitting.  There is also a separate small piece of plastic; and I dont know what is it for?  Finally, opening the unit after cleaning is tricky and not easy.

            <li> My husband has a mouth guard that he uses every night.  Therefore, every morning, he places it in this unit to clean it.  He has liked using it since he got it. It makes his life easier.</li>
            <li> The unit is way too small to fit dentures in it.  I bought it to clean my dentures.  It does not work.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this all the time to clean her mouth guard.  Don&#x27;t know how ti might work for other things. But she uses it regularly now for a couple years without a hitch.</li>
            <li> The dental cleaner works great. It cleans and you can feel the diifference when you insert retainers back into your mouth, after cleaning.    Good product!</li>
            <li> This is not a denture cleaner. It&#x27;s too small for dentures. When I complained they said I must have large teeth - NO. Actually my dentist says I had the smallest teeth he ever worked on.&lt;br /&gt;Since I knew I&#x27;d have to pay about $15- to return it for the shipping, I tried it out with a dirty necklace to see how it worked. NO change at all in the necklace.&lt;br /&gt;So this is just a scam item. I&#x27;ve made up my mind not to buy anything on Amazon that they don&#x27;t ship themselves.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve had this thing since december, over 9 months,  too expensive, rarely worked, uv light never comes on.sometimes if I keep turning it on and off the uv light will come on but that&#x27;s after trying over four or five times.I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and works great on my retainer.  I use the AC adapter and remove the perforated tray.</li>
            <li> I bought this to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; my invisalign retainers after nightly use instead of the morning scrub. This thing does not clean compared to a brush. I ran it twice to see if a second run would do any better, but it still feels slimy from overnight use after two runs. I see the vibrations causing cool looking ripples on the waters surface and the goofy little light show is nice, but I was hoping for something to clean these things to save a few minutes in the morning routine. I don&#x27;t know if there is some cleanser that might work, but the instructions say add water.</li>
            <li> Item received, promptly and as advertised.  Good price for a good quality product.  Although the capacity is limited, I would recommend this product, as well as seller.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It saves me so much time.  I wish I had purchased the Nano &amp; UV Dental cleaner when it first came on the market.  fr</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my whitening trays (which I really use as bite plates to cushion my teeth when I clench them during sleep). It seems to work great.  I love not having to use chemicals or cleaning agents.  the dental devices taste clean and fresh after cleaning.  My only complaint so far is  the poor directions which were included are not all that helpful.  I am not sure if you are supposed to fill with water if only using the U.V. function (so I just fill it with water and put it on the sonic clean + u.v. setting). It is also unclear when or why you would choose to use the \\&quot;U.V. only\\&quot; setting rather than sonic + U.V.  Regarding those who say it is too small for dentures, I think all you have to do is take out the perforated removable tray and then you have much more room in the tub area to place appliances.  Again, the problem is the directions do not address this and I am not positive if you are in fact supposed to run it without that tray.  There is no 800 number or email address or website URL for customer service.</li>
            <li> Did not perform as advertised, or I did not read what they really were saying. Would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I purchased this cleaner because it had an adapter included.  The only problem with it is that its very noisy, almost hurts your ears.  I would have returned it but not worth spending the money to return.  It still does the job of of cleaning, I hope.  Just have to close the door when its on and wait for 5 minutes then it shuts off.  I would love to hear from others if this is a standard noise problem for dental cleaners or is this just a cheaply made one!  I use this for my night guard and it fits ok, but not sure if it will be big enough for dentures.</li>
            <li> I had one question and cannot find an answer to it, can you use cleaner in this or is it not necessary?</li>
            <li> Got this for my bite guard. Works well, makes me feel as though it is oh so much more sanitary</li>
