            <li>I think these are perfect face pads.  </li>
            <li>These work great at cleaning my face and helping to prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li>Works great at exfoliating and my skin is noticeable softer.</li>
            <li>I can use my own face wash with it.</li>
            <li>These facial pads are perfect for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>These are the best facial scrubbers!  </li>
            <li>The product is ok, looks cute.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find them on amazon.</li>
            <li>Now I give my face a pretty good scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I like to replace them about every month, and I keep several on hand; so this three-pack set is great.</li>
            <li>weave not as soft as I would like - good deal</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>It may not be for you if you have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, but for someone who has blackheads, dead/dry skin it is amazing.</li>
            <li>exfoliates and leaves skin feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>Much better than the ones I was getting at CVS, last longer and work better.</li>
            <li>I finally thought to check Amazon, and while these aren&#x27;t exactly the same, I&#x27;m very happy to have found these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product and bought 3 more!</li>
            <li>All in all, I am satisfied with this product and would recommend it to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love that there are two textures - a \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; side and a soft side.</li>
            <li>After my first round I put my face under the warm water, then circled again lightly, then soaped up with my Biore cleaner.</li>
            <li>Its nice and small so i can store it easily.</li>
            <li>They have a nice spongy backing to pick up the soap and the surface isn&#x27;t too rough</li>
            <li>has an elastic band on the back for sturdy grip on fingers, a loop on the top for hang drying, and is made of quality materials.</li>
            <li>Love this facial pad.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>the first layer of skin was scrubbed off.</li>
            <li>and this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love that it is rough enough to scrub all that off and leave your face feelings refreshed and clean!</li>
            <li>This exfoliates but is still gentle compared to rougher pads I have used.</li>
            <li>I really love these pads; they have just the right amount of scrubbing action, but soft enough so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel like</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still like new!</li>
            <li>They have the texture I need to make my face feel soft and clean, but they&#x27;re also gentle enough that they don&#x27;t hurt like loofah pads do.</li>
            <li>Love these for daily facial cleansing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent face cloth/cleaner</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought these, but they&#x27;ve surprised me!</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Each pad has a little loop on top</li>
            <li>I think they are gentler than my old one, even after all of its use, and I generally have pretty sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They air-dry nicely and quickly, and unlike loofah material, they aren&#x27;t stiff and hard to use.</li>
            <li>I got in a hot shower and shampooed my hair first to give my pores time to open up, then circled the pad on my face and made sure to use the side bits to get that difficult to reach area on the sides of my nose and between my lower lip and chin.</li>
            <li>I used to buy these near home, but I can&#x27;t find them anymore.</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant to buy these as I have *very* sensitive skin which gets red, puffy, and itchy at the thought of being touched, but it was actually just what my skin needed.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned in their reviews, I think the material could be too rough if you really scrub your face with the facial pad versus using a gentle circling movement.</li>
            <li>but the shelves were bare.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out well.</li>
            <li>It was so harsh at first</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does not dry out well.</li>
            <li> It was so harsh at first</li>
            <li> I think if you have a heavy hand, you might find them too rough but normal pressure in standard circular motions has left my skin baby soft and aided in nightly and morning cleansing routines.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty harsh the first few uses, but then it softens a little.</li>
            <li> I use my gentle weave facial pad at least once a day but sometimes twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Usually my face would be red all day from any sort of scrubbing, but after using this pad with soap my skin was actually very soft and was its normal pale color.</li>
            <li> Not too rough on delicate facial skin, even from the first use.</li>
            <li> side is a \\&quot;rough\\&quot; plastic-y mesh type of material, meant for exfoliation, and the other is a soft terry cloth type of material with a stretchy band over the center for you to slide your hand through for easier scrubbing with the mesh side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased a pad similar to these some months ago while on a road trip, and I ended up wearing a hole through the center of it while trying to find another like it.</li>
            <li> so you can hang it to dry after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tip - hang it to dry, so that it doesn&#x27;t mildew.</li>
            <li> Make this a 6 star rating if it was just a little bigger.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any problems with them being too rough for my face.</li>
            <li> The rough side isn&#x27;t too rough as some of the reviews say.</li>
            <li> It is not to harsh that you feel like you are rubbing your skin off, but just enough so that you are exfoliating your skin well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are too rough and sterilize them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the other side of it now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Entirely too small for me.</li>
            <li> There is a little strip of cloth on the back of the pad that a few fingers could be slipped through for added grip.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really a little rough for my face.....</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t feel like you are sanding you face down.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that after using it five or six times I noticed a weird discoloration.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a couple years and was not able to find them in the store.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> I bought a package because they are so hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that flakes terribly in winter.  </li>

I finally thought to check Amazon, and while these aren&#x27;t exactly the same, I&#x27;m very happy to have found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side is a \\&quot;rough\\&quot; plastic-y mesh type of material, meant for exfoliation, and the other is a soft terry cloth type of material with a stretchy band over the center for you to slide your hand through for easier scrubbing with the mesh side.

I think they are gentler than my old one, even after all of its use, and I generally have pretty sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing these again, before I wear holes through them!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that flakes terribly in winter.  These facial pads are perfect for exfoliating. I think if you have a heavy hand, you might find them too rough but normal pressure in standard circular motions has left my skin baby soft and aided in nightly and morning cleansing routines.  I use my gentle weave facial pad at least once a day but sometimes twice a day.  I have used one pad over the course of a month and I can see how it will likely need replaced in another two weeks.  So, with moderate use, I anticipate six to eight weeks of use.  There is a little strip of cloth on the back of the pad that a few fingers could be slipped through for added grip.  All in all, I am satisfied with this product and would recommend it to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to buy these as I have *very* sensitive skin which gets red, puffy, and itchy at the thought of being touched, but it was actually just what my skin needed.

Usually my face would be red all day from any sort of scrubbing, but after using this pad with soap my skin was actually very soft and was its normal pale color. Hooray for these pads!</li>
            <li> These work great at cleaning my face and helping to prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  They have a nice spongy backing to pick up the soap and the surface isn&#x27;t too rough so you don&#x27;t feel like you are sanding you face down.  I will be ordering these again</li>
            <li> These are the best facial scrubbers!  Local Wally World use to carry these but the shelves were bare.  Turned to Amazon to restock.</li>
            <li> The product is ok, looks cute. But it&#x27;s really a little rough for my face.....I&#x27;m using the other side of it now.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it will get softened by water as I use it, maybe not.</li>
            <li> These are the only facial pads I use. They have the texture I need to make my face feel soft and clean, but they&#x27;re also gentle enough that they don&#x27;t hurt like loofah pads do. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Make this a 6 star rating if it was just a little bigger. It&#x27;s pretty harsh the first few uses, but then it softens a little. It was so harsh at first I was afraid my sensitive skin was not gonna be able to handle it. Now I give my face a pretty good scrubbing. Works great at exfoliating and my skin is noticeable softer.</li>
            <li> Love these for daily facial cleansing. I bought a package because they are so hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Entirely too small for me. Does not dry out well.</li>
            <li> The rough side isn&#x27;t too rough as some of the reviews say. Its nice and small so i can store it easily. The only problem is that after using it five or six times I noticed a weird discoloration. I don&#x27;t think theres any problem with a bit of color, and it might just be a bleaching effect from the face wash I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> This exfoliates but is still gentle compared to rougher pads I have used. My face feels smooth and clean after using it. It is also thicker/more padded than similar pads I have bought.</li>
            <li> does the job well. exfoliates and leaves skin feeling super clean. has an elastic band on the back for sturdy grip on fingers, a loop on the top for hang drying, and is made of quality materials. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like these facial pads. I love that there are two textures - a \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; side and a soft side. I use the rougher side for exfoliation (I have a lot of flaking), and the softer side to wash off facial cleansers.  I use it every day!  Tip - hang it to dry, so that it doesn&#x27;t mildew.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a couple years and was not able to find them in the store.&lt;br /&gt;Was great finding them offered online!</li>
            <li> Love this facial pad.  I order them whenever I&#x27;m low.  Keeps my skin soft and smooth.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use mine in the shower. It is not to harsh that you feel like you are rubbing your skin off, but just enough so that you are exfoliating your skin well. I used to buy these near home, but I can&#x27;t find them anymore. I was glad to find them on amazon.</li>
            <li> I really love these pads; they have just the right amount of scrubbing action, but soft enough so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel like the first layer of skin was scrubbed off. They air-dry nicely and quickly, and unlike loofah material, they aren&#x27;t stiff and hard to use. I like to replace them about every month, and I keep several on hand; so this three-pack set is great.</li>
            <li> weave not as soft as I would like - good deal but I would not reorder nor would I recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought these, but they&#x27;ve surprised me! Not too rough on delicate facial skin, even from the first use. No need to &amp;#34;let it soften with use&amp;#34;. I like that I can use my own face wash with it. I&#x27;ve been using mine just over a month but it&#x27;s still like new!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent face cloth/cleaner and this was exactly what I was looking for. It may not be for you if you have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, but for someone who has blackheads, dead/dry skin it is amazing. I love that it is rough enough to scrub all that off and leave your face feelings refreshed and clean! I would definitely recommend this product and bought 3 more!</li>
            <li> I think these are perfect face pads.  I don&#x27;t think they are too rough and sterilize them so they last longer.  I like that I can use which ever face cleaner I want.</li>
