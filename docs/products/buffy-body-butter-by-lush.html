            <li>Yuck) thatcan clog pores causing breakouts and leave your skin feeling rough/dry/not at your best.</li>
            <li>Excellent for fuzzy legged hippies like myself</li>
            <li>even my daughters love it!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m incredibly thankful.</li>
            <li>It smells like beautiful almond oils.</li>
            <li>One of the great things about being an Ex-Lush employee is all the knowledge I&#x27;ve retained and how it&#x27;s helped shape my skin and haircare decisions forever.</li>
            <li>This bar is amazing!</li>
            <li>I loved using this body butter..</li>
            <li>Just use a good body wash, rinse, and then rub this bar all over your skin</li>
            <li>I used this bar through your my pregnancy, and was very satisfied with the moisture</li>
            <li>I love this bar and use it every day!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it was amazing..</li>
            <li>Always so amazingly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>As nice as this is for my skin, I stopped using for that reason.</li>
            <li>It does buff and leaves your skin nicely moisturized</li>
            <li>It is my own fault for not reading the details and noticing that this is the 3.3oz size.</li>
            <li>I use a washcloth in my hand to help me keep a good grip on the bar, and use light, circular motions to buff my skin.  </li>
            <li>Just not from anywhere but a Lush store/website to get the best quality (expiration dates are a thing, yo) and price.</li>
            <li>Great buy, Lush is just an amazing brand.</li>
            <li>The bar itself gets 5 stars (more if I could give them)</li>
            <li>A friend brought me in and I was instantly amazed with all of the beautiful-smelling products, awesome customer service, and variety of funky, innovative products.</li>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not kept awake by scratchy hotel (or extended family&#x27;s) sheets, and have had to give away beautiful, well-fitting clothes because I physically can&#x27;t stay in them,</li>
            <li>so it made my skin smooth after my shower</li>
            <li>Not only does it moisturize, but it is a great exfollient as well.</li>
            <li>It does leave a nice amount of moisturizer on the skin so that you really don&#x27;t need additional lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product, and LUSH in general.</li>
            <li>(just short of oily, but nice!).</li>
            <li>and skin-more than a quick rinse, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The great thing about Buffy for people with sensitive skin is that the ingredients used are super fresh and natural.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I thought it felt like sandpaper, and it still does if I use it too vigorously, but I can get excellent results without needing to scrub hard.  </li>
            <li>Lush is pretty all around amazing, &amp; this product is as well.</li>
            <li>To use Buffy, I get myself clean in the shower first then either step out of the tub or turn the water off temporarily.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price</li>
            <li>I paid more for it on Amazon Prime than I would have from Lush&#x27;s web site WITH shipping charges.</li>
            <li>I tried Buffy (full name: Buffy the Backside Slayer, a play-on-words and homage to Buffy the Vampire Slayer---which also tells you how long it&#x27;s been around and how popular it still is) in the store, immediately fell in love, purchased it and eventually went on to work in a Lush store.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re someone looking to exfoliate before shaving, looking for a quick and easy way to scrub away dead skin while in the shower and not wanting to add lengthy steps to your routine, or if you love amazing products that are made well and support companies doing great things (like ethical buying practices, give to charity, and are constantly exercising their activist muscles for animal/human/environmental causes).</li>
            <li>but with soft buttery oils you feel clean &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>And because I use a light touch, my Buffy bars tend to last a good long time too.  </li>
            <li>It is better than even using a moisturizing soap and then moisturizer later.</li>
            <li>and it leaves your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>First of all: 5 star product, but BUY IT FROM THE WEBSITE.</li>
            <li>Just use it sparingly and lightly until you know how your skin will respond, and enjoy discovering the many other LUSH items whose preservative-free, fresh production can help soothe \\&quot;tough\\&quot; and sensitive skin alike.</li>
            <li>Not only sensitive in the sense that I take my own set of sheets with me when I travel</li>
            <li>I overall like the product, but did find it much too abrasive to use more than a 2 - 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>it did not really affect my skin that much too, to be honest.</li>
            <li>Made of ground nut exfoliants-rice, almond and aduki beans, to be exact-and a combination of fair trade cocoa butter and shea butter, it&#x27;s literally a block of ethically-sourced, high-powered moisturizers with natural, effective exfoliators that leave your skin amazingly scented, moisturized, and free of dead skin (by the way-did you know that if you don&#x27;t exfoliate, dead skin cells accumulate on the skin for an average of 28 days before flaking off?</li>
            <li>Interesting soap: very moisturizing but also sandy in feel- pretty rough and leaves sand in the bath.</li>
            <li>&quot; it feels so soft!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, like many others out there, I highly recommend Buffy, even for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This was the first product that introduced me to Lush</li>
            <li>The first time I ever heard of and went to a Lush Cosmetics store was when I was 17 and in high school.</li>
            <li>Lush Cosmetics only sells their products in their own stores and on their website, so when you see Lush products elsewhere it&#x27;s because people have purchased them and are trying to re-sell them at a marked-up price for a profit (which is understandable for products that aren&#x27;t currently being sold, but not fan-favorites like Buffy!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to remove your dead skin, while making it hydrated and smooth, this is it!</li>
            <li>The only thing that wasnt fun was it leaves tub oily</li>
            <li>super rough.  </li>
            <li>Be careful to keep it in a tin or out of the shower though, you will lose it quickly if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Buffy is also without packaging, making it free of waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buffy is also incredibly simple and convenient because you can use it in the bath or shower as your last step to exfoliate and in-shower moisturize in one OR before shaving to get rid of dead skin that can make nicks and cuts more likely (trust me on this one, you&#x27;ll thank me).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sensitive to skin care products too.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend and did not know I was paying 3x&#x27;s the price Lush charges.</li>
            <li>This seller is over charging for all Lush products.</li>
            <li>Go direct, this seller is a scam.</li>
            <li>Lush makes unless you look at the Lush website).</li>
            <li>I simply wanted to get a buyers attention with the 1 star review to inform anyone consider this purchase to go directly to lush.com to buy the product directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I usually just cover my legs, backside, and upper arms, then hop back into the shower for a quick rinse, and I do use an additional moisturizer after the shower, since I don&#x27;t cover my whole body with Buffy.  </li>
            <li>You can get this for a third of the price from Lush.</li>
            <li>the bar just dismantled (fell apart really quickly with only few uses).</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure I sound like a sappy, obsessed Lush fanatic (I am), so I&#x27;ll leave you with the very few possible downsides:</li>
            <li> So, you can buy the larger bars (7 ounce) for less money directly from Lush.com (plus no shipping charge!)</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t last very long....</li>
            <li> And know that because these moisturizers are pretty thick and luxurious, they may take some time to properly wash off tub floors (careful!)</li>
            <li> Buffy Body Butter hardly needs another rave review, but after reading through what the other reviewers have written, I wanted to clear up one thing for all my fellow sensitive skin guys and gals: You can use Buffy too!    </li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it to ppl wit dry, rough skin.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve really dry skin &amp; after using the \\&quot;butter\\</li>
            <li> for less than you can buy the smaller bars from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Buffy is super weird on boobs.</li>
            <li> Like the fact that most store-brand exfoliants/scrubs use toxic plastic microbeads that are so harsh they can tear your skin and then end up polluting oceans and harming the animals that ingest them-a whole bunch of horrifying &#x27;</li>
            <li> it was not at all what i expected.</li>
            <li> i would purchase some other form of body exfoiliation.</li>
            <li> Just be careful in your tub or shower after as without thorough rinsing can leave a bit of slick residue.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this little thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always avoided scented skin care items because of irritating chemical fragrances, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the essential oils used in this product.      </li>
            <li> A few coworkers and I had this joint discussion...</li>
            <li> For me, cutting the bar into small pieces doesn&#x27;t work as well as just keeping the bar dry and storing it outside the shower.  </li>
            <li> I like it but too expensive for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I assumed I would be getting a 7oz bar, and was extremely disappointed when I received only 3.3oz.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell, but it&#x27;s a little too &amp;#34;barnyard&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just sort of awkward.</li>
            <li> Crazy over-priced!</li>

            <li> Buffy Body Butter hardly needs another rave review, but after reading through what the other reviewers have written, I wanted to clear up one thing for all my fellow sensitive skin guys and gals: You can use Buffy too!    I have sensitive skin.  Not only sensitive in the sense that I take my own set of sheets with me when I travel so I&#x27;m not kept awake by scratchy hotel (or extended family&#x27;s) sheets, and have had to give away beautiful, well-fitting clothes because I physically can&#x27;t stay in them, but I&#x27;m sensitive to skin care products too.  I can&#x27;t borrow just any lotion or sunscreen or soap for fear I&#x27;ll have a reaction to a preservative or additive.  But I still use Buffy without any problem.    Because it&#x27;s an exfoliator, Buffy is (surprise, surprise!) super rough.  The first time I tried it, I thought it felt like sandpaper, and it still does if I use it too vigorously, but I can get excellent results without needing to scrub hard.  And because I use a light touch, my Buffy bars tend to last a good long time too.  For me, cutting the bar into small pieces doesn&#x27;t work as well as just keeping the bar dry and storing it outside the shower.  To use Buffy, I get myself clean in the shower first then either step out of the tub or turn the water off temporarily.  I use a washcloth in my hand to help me keep a good grip on the bar, and use light, circular motions to buff my skin.  I usually just cover my legs, backside, and upper arms, then hop back into the shower for a quick rinse, and I do use an additional moisturizer after the shower, since I don&#x27;t cover my whole body with Buffy.  I use the bar about once a week and never on my legs if I&#x27;ve just shaved them.    The great thing about Buffy for people with sensitive skin is that the ingredients used are super fresh and natural.  I&#x27;d always avoided scented skin care items because of irritating chemical fragrances, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the essential oils used in this product.      Overall, like many others out there, I highly recommend Buffy, even for people with sensitive skin.  Just use it sparingly and lightly until you know how your skin will respond, and enjoy discovering the many other LUSH items whose preservative-free, fresh production can help soothe \\&quot;tough\\&quot; and sensitive skin alike.</li>
            <li> I loved using this body butter..it was amazing..I have KP so it made my skin smooth after my shower and it left it a lil bit greasy which I didn&#x27;t mind....It also left my tub greasy which was a lil bit of a problem... I just wish that they would find a way to keep the body butter from melting away in the bath but otherwise it is an awesome product and I would definitely recommend it to ppl wit dry, rough skin.</li>
            <li> This bar is amazing! My skin always feels so moisturized. It is better than even using a moisturizing soap and then moisturizer later. I am hooked on this little thing.</li>
            <li> I have KP (keratosis pilaris) and have been looking for ways to get rid of the bumps on the backs of my arms, legs, and butt for years. My mom gave me this bar after a trip she went on. It&#x27;s wonderful! Not only does it moisturize, but it is a great exfollient as well. I love this bar and use it every day! Be careful to keep it in a tin or out of the shower though, you will lose it quickly if you don&#x27;t. I use it after I turn the shower off and then run it all over myself, then I can just turn the shower back on and rinse the grains off. Easy and it leaves your skin so soft and smooth. I am very happy with this product, and LUSH in general.</li>
            <li> love it! i&#x27;ve really dry skin &amp; after using the \\&quot;butter\\&quot; it feels so soft!!! even my daughters love it!!!</li>
            <li> My skin likes it! It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell, but it&#x27;s a little too &amp;#34;barnyard&amp;#34; for me. As nice as this is for my skin, I stopped using for that reason.</li>
            <li> Interesting soap: very moisturizing but also sandy in feel- pretty rough and leaves sand in the bath.</li>
            <li> Crazy over-priced! You can get this for a third of the price from Lush.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magnificent. If you are looking for something to remove your dead skin, while making it hydrated and smooth, this is it! Just use a good body wash, rinse, and then rub this bar all over your skin and when you get out your skin will almost glow! You will feel so moisturized you won&#x27;t even believe it. Great buy, Lush is just an amazing brand.</li>
            <li> I like it but too expensive for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It does buff and leaves your skin nicely moisturized (just short of oily, but nice!). However it doesn&#x27;t last very long....I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price</li>
            <li> The bar itself gets 5 stars (more if I could give them) I used this bar through your my pregnancy, and was very satisfied with the moisture it provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I gave a 3 star rating because of the price of this item from this seller. It is my own fault for not reading the details and noticing that this is the 3.3oz size. But I was mislead by the price being the same as LushUSA.com&#x27;s price for the 7oz size. I assumed I would be getting a 7oz bar, and was extremely disappointed when I received only 3.3oz. I paid more for it on Amazon Prime than I would have from Lush&#x27;s web site WITH shipping charges. I just wanted to caution future buyers, so they can avoid this mixup.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling softer than ever. It smells like beautiful almond oils. The only thing that wasnt fun was it leaves tub oily but thats not the products fault.</li>
            <li> This is a great product however I cannot believe this rip off price!!!!  I bought this for my girlfriend and did not know I was paying 3x&#x27;s the price Lush charges. This seller is over charging for all Lush products. Go direct, this seller is a scam.</li>
            <li> First of all: 5 star product, but BUY IT FROM THE WEBSITE. Lush Cosmetics only sells their products in their own stores and on their website, so when you see Lush products elsewhere it&#x27;s because people have purchased them and are trying to re-sell them at a marked-up price for a profit (which is understandable for products that aren&#x27;t currently being sold, but not fan-favorites like Buffy!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, yes, I&#x27;m an ex-Lush employee, but even though I no longer work there I still shop there as if I did. The first time I ever heard of and went to a Lush Cosmetics store was when I was 17 and in high school. A friend brought me in and I was instantly amazed with all of the beautiful-smelling products, awesome customer service, and variety of funky, innovative products. I tried Buffy (full name: Buffy the Backside Slayer, a play-on-words and homage to Buffy the Vampire Slayer---which also tells you how long it&#x27;s been around and how popular it still is) in the store, immediately fell in love, purchased it and eventually went on to work in a Lush store. One of the great things about being an Ex-Lush employee is all the knowledge I&#x27;ve retained and how it&#x27;s helped shape my skin and haircare decisions forever. Like the fact that most store-brand exfoliants/scrubs use toxic plastic microbeads that are so harsh they can tear your skin and then end up polluting oceans and harming the animals that ingest them-a whole bunch of horrifying &#x27;nope&#x27; with only one tiny aspect of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buffy is different. Made of ground nut exfoliants-rice, almond and aduki beans, to be exact-and a combination of fair trade cocoa butter and shea butter, it&#x27;s literally a block of ethically-sourced, high-powered moisturizers with natural, effective exfoliators that leave your skin amazingly scented, moisturized, and free of dead skin (by the way-did you know that if you don&#x27;t exfoliate, dead skin cells accumulate on the skin for an average of 28 days before flaking off? Yuck) thatcan clog pores causing breakouts and leave your skin feeling rough/dry/not at your best. Buffy is also without packaging, making it free of waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buffy is also incredibly simple and convenient because you can use it in the bath or shower as your last step to exfoliate and in-shower moisturize in one OR before shaving to get rid of dead skin that can make nicks and cuts more likely (trust me on this one, you&#x27;ll thank me). This was the first product that introduced me to Lush and I&#x27;m incredibly thankful. I definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re someone looking to exfoliate before shaving, looking for a quick and easy way to scrub away dead skin while in the shower and not wanting to add lengthy steps to your routine, or if you love amazing products that are made well and support companies doing great things (like ethical buying practices, give to charity, and are constantly exercising their activist muscles for animal/human/environmental causes). I&#x27;m sure I sound like a sappy, obsessed Lush fanatic (I am), so I&#x27;ll leave you with the very few possible downsides: Buffy is super weird on boobs. A few coworkers and I had this joint discussion...it&#x27;s just sort of awkward. And know that because these moisturizers are pretty thick and luxurious, they may take some time to properly wash off tub floors (careful!) and skin-more than a quick rinse, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Buy it. Just not from anywhere but a Lush store/website to get the best quality (expiration dates are a thing, yo) and price.</li>
            <li> I overall like the product, but did find it much too abrasive to use more than a 2 - 3 times a week.  It does leave a nice amount of moisturizer on the skin so that you really don&#x27;t need additional lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> Greatt product that does its job.</li>
            <li> Will always give the buffy bar a 5 star rating.  Always so amazingly moisturizing.  We use it as the last step after washing with our soap.  Just be careful in your tub or shower after as without thorough rinsing can leave a bit of slick residue.</li>
            <li> Clarification, this product is 5 starts all the way. It is the only thing that saves my skin in the winter. Love it! I simply wanted to get a buyers attention with the 1 star review to inform anyone consider this purchase to go directly to lush.com to buy the product directly from the manufacturer. My mistake that I did not look closely enough at the Amazon details and assumed these bars were the larger size based on the price being charged. Nope. They are the smaller size (which it does indicate 3 ounce but you wouldn&#x27;t know that&#x27;s the smaller of the two sizes Lush makes unless you look at the Lush website). So, you can buy the larger bars (7 ounce) for less money directly from Lush.com (plus no shipping charge!) for less than you can buy the smaller bars from Amazon. My mistake, which I will not make again.</li>
            <li> Lush is pretty all around amazing, &amp; this product is as well. Scrubby but with soft buttery oils you feel clean &amp; smooth. Excellent for fuzzy legged hippies like myself</li>
            <li> it was not at all what i expected. the bar just dismantled (fell apart really quickly with only few uses). it did not really affect my skin that much too, to be honest. i would purchase some other form of body exfoiliation.</li>
