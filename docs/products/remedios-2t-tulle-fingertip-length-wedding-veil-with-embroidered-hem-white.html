            <li> The comb fell off as soon as I took it out of the package, poorly attached, luckily the fabric was glued together, and didn&#x27;t fall apart with the comb.</li>
            <li> I looked other places</li>
            <li> and I wore it in front of me as I walked down the isle.</li>
            <li> I will need to spruce it up a little with some pearls but the price was off the change.</li>
            <li> but when I got it the Vail was so wrinkled from them having it in a small box</li>

            <li> Veil is very pretty and just as pictured. You would definitely need to steam it though. I also really loved the double tier and I wore it in front of me as I walked down the isle. The effect is very nice. Well made.</li>
            <li> almost cried when I took it out of the box, beautiful</li>

            <li> Perfect for occasion looks great I will need to spruce it up a little with some pearls but the price was off the change. I looked other places the price was $ 100-$ 200 and this one looks better. I would advise others to purchase</li>
            <li> Stunning! Such a great value.....needs to be steamed for wrinkles.....but such a great deal!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to get married with this veil. Even though it is not as flawless as some may want it to be, I think that it is perfect, affordable, and so pretty! It will get the job done! :)</li>
            <li> the fabric was not what I expected and  the product was far from being well finished, seams were plenty of defects.</li>
            <li> The Vail is beautiful but when I got it the Vail was so wrinkled from them having it in a small box and the comb started to come off I had to glue it back on not to mention one of the things that goes into your hair broke off I give it 3 stars because it is beautiful but it started coming apart and that&#x27;s a dissapointment</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and compliment the wedding dress. Thanks</li>
            <li> Came out so beautiful, looks just like the picture, the only reason I gave it a 4 star was the packing, it came wrinkle, so I have to take it a dry cleaners, wich only cost me three dollars. But it was no problem, can&#x27;t wait to have it on my wedding,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They had this same looking one at David&#x27;s Bridal for 200 dollars, so have this for 6 dollars was perfect!</li>
            <li> Great buy. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love it. its very nice and new ,my mom like it too.+ Fast shipping . Thanks for your business.</li>
            <li> Looks cheaply made, very time consuming to make it look half decent.</li>
            <li> For the price is a great veil. Comes with two flaps, in case you want to start out with one over your face. Good material, nicely made.</li>
            <li> The veil is nice, exactly as advertised. It was full and high, and very neat.  The comb fell off as soon as I took it out of the package, poorly attached, luckily the fabric was glued together, and didn&#x27;t fall apart with the comb.</li>
            <li> Beautiful I love the flower in it</li>
            <li> It came on time and it was beautiful</li>
            <li> Got in the mail , and even MORE pretty then in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;And look&#x27;s like it cost me over $200.00&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT for the price.</li>
            <li> Even more gorgeous in person!</li>
