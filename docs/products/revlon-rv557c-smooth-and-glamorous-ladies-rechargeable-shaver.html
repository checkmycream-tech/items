    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have had my shaver for over a year &amp; still works great.  </li>
            <li>And the fact that is rechargeable is great, too.  </li>
            <li>The razor is good but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well.</li>
            <li>it was good.</li>
            <li>This is a great size and shape, sits nicely in its charger without taking up a lot of space, and very comfortable against the skin.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic and Revlon razors that I purchased work fine and the family members that I purchased them for are happy with the products, but I was not given the discount that was offered by acquiring a Amazon credit card.</li>
            <li>I accidently broke the first and was so happy to find a replacement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many razors over the years and this one is comfortable to hold, easy to use and does a good job on both my legs and under arms.</li>
            <li>It is ok</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because it better than razor, no nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>Love it now.</li>
            <li>But this shaver is pretty easy to use and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>

            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; function yet, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>This is a great little rechargable electric shaver that works pretty good - not as close as a razor but works for \\&quot;touch ups\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I wanted a shaver with a cord but opted for a chargeable shaver because they had a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Charges quick.  </li>
            <li>Very petite and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>, in short: nice  and  handy design with a lack of technical workmanship.</li>
            <li>I did mail it in a got the replacement very fast</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the legs.  </li>
            <li>I really like my little shaver, I only use it for my mustache and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>The first one a received however was messed up.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than the previous shaver I had, and works great.  </li>
            <li>Difficult to clean otherwise its a good purchase.</li>
            <li>noise level high</li>
            <li>If your hair is long (more than 1/4 inch) or coarse, it just skips over the hair and doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>This shaver only works on short or fine hair.</li>
            <li>Looks so cute and comes with a small pouch.</li>
            <li>my husband uses this for other than facial hair and he satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>this product is pure cosmetic with onlay a low profile function.  </li>
            <li>when first in usage it fell apart right away, skin feeling is not good at all,</li>

            <li> It is smaller than the previous shaver I had, and works great.  Charges quick.  Haven&#x27;t used the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; function yet, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> worst shaver ever.  Won&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to shave one leg.  Pulls hair on legs instead of shaving them. Very uncomfortable. Cheaply made. Buy another brand.</li>
            <li> This is the second Revlon RV557 razor I&#x27;ve had.  I accidently broke the first and was so happy to find a replacement. I&#x27;ve used many razors over the years and this one is comfortable to hold, easy to use and does a good job on both my legs and under arms.</li>
            <li> It is ok I use it on a regular basis Recharges well and it shaves quite well ,irretated my skin a little</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. The shaving blade kept falling off. I tried several times to use it, but the blades/foil part would not stay attached. I do not recommend this shaver. I plan to return this and ask for a refund.  [[ASIN:B000A3I32E Revlon RV557C Smooth and Glamorous Ladies Rechargeable Shaver]]</li>
            <li> The Panasonic and Revlon razors that I purchased work fine and the family members that I purchased them for are happy with the products, but I was not given the discount that was offered by acquiring a Amazon credit card.</li>
            <li> this product is pure cosmetic with onlay a low profile function.  when first in usage it fell apart right away, skin feeling is not good at all, noise level high, in short: nice  and  handy design with a lack of technical workmanship. made in china, canÂ´t recommend it to someone else</li>
            <li> The razor is good but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well. The first one a received however was messed up. Somehow the cord was melted together but the package was not damaged and was sealed shut. I did mail it in a got the replacement very fast and I had a no hassle exchange. So all and all it was good.</li>
            <li> This is a great little rechargable electric shaver that works pretty good - not as close as a razor but works for \\&quot;touch ups\\&quot;. The foil head is delecate nad not replacable - so treat with care.</li>
            <li> This shaver only works on short or fine hair. If your hair is long (more than 1/4 inch) or coarse, it just skips over the hair and doesn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ve thrown it away and gone back to disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Looks so cute and comes with a small pouch. My skin feels rough after using it. But I guess its the same with any electric shaver. Difficult to clean otherwise its a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted a shaver with a cord but opted for a chargeable shaver because they had a more reasonable price. It worked well for a while and then it quit fully charging.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut the hair or stay charged. Sorry, not a fan. That is why I am returning it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> One I started using the shaver it fell apart.  It has plastic tabs to hold it together and they just don&#x27;t work.  The shaver is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a wet/dry shaver to replace the one I had lost.  This is working well and convenient.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it better than razor, no nicks and cuts. It does the job faster than a razor.</li>
            <li> With normal use this item lasted less than 6 weeks. The charging stand fell apart and even after putting it back together it refused to charge. I have used several other brands of electric shavers and all have lasted a year or longer. Am very disappointed in the poor quality of this item. Rather than paying a five dollar fee plus shipping to have it repaired I am just starting over with another brand.</li>
            <li> I really like my little shaver, I only use it for my mustache and it works wonderfully.  I have had my shaver for over a year &amp; still works great.  Now I need to start looking or a replacement blade, does anyone know where I can get one?</li>
            <li> I always have a little apprehensiveness when I get something new.  But this shaver is pretty easy to use and it works great.  My only complaint might be that the head comes off sometimes for no reason at all it seems.  But I just put it back on and keep a going.  And the fact that is rechargeable is great, too.  Love it now.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this for other than facial hair and he satisfied with it. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a great size and shape, sits nicely in its charger without taking up a lot of space, and very comfortable against the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my pre teen daughter.  Very petite and easy to handle.  Very gentle on the legs.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
