            <li>This is the best organic deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I tried Tom&#x27;s and Vermont Soap&#x27;s (great products, BTW - try their organic foaming hand soap!!), but neither worked for me.</li>
            <li>DeodoMom works great for me!  </li>
            <li>Awesome product!!</li>
            <li>I like, this has been the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say Deodomom and Jason in apricot scent are the best, but the Jason&#x27;s leaves underarms feeling sticky when you begin to sweat.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed</li>
            <li>This works brilliantly on me!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>it is greatly reduced and it smells like sweat not some ultra foul odor multiplied by 10!&lt;br /&gt;YAY!</li>
            <li>I was using the Organic Island deodorant which was also wonderful</li>
            <li>So impressed with this.</li>
            <li>You may want to experiment yourself and figure out which amount is best for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!!</li>

            <li>It smells great too.  </li>
            <li>Was great for about 5 days.</li>
            <li>And for once I can say I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li>so it is a great value.</li>
            <li>recommended this product to my sisters, who also agreed it is great, and they have both switched to DeodoMom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The company is great.  </li>

            <li>Great for people who sweat often and</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found this one.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Who would of thought constipation medicine would be a great pit deodorant.</li>
            <li>Both work great.  </li>
            <li>I gave this cream deodorant a try, not thinking it would work, and it was great.</li>
            <li>For me it was a great find, and I will continue to use</li>
            <li>frankincense and myrrh are a great combo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>Amazing deodorant!</li>
            <li>amazing!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have tried it now, and it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This seems to work the best and is safe.</li>
            <li>And I do not smell good...</li>
            <li>and then when I have done that I am good to go.</li>
            <li>I was using Jungleman deodorant and LOVED it, but it started to bother my skin</li>
            <li>It still allows you to sweat which is a good thing</li>
            <li>even after a good work out at the gym.</li>
            <li>Over-all, good product.</li>
            <li>or so I can get another 3 good days out of it.  </li>
            <li>I stay &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; free all day, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both the roll-on and cream and found them both good.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I did not use this on a long-term basis, but I will offer my opinion based on when I did use it and on</li>
            <li>It is a really good option</li>
            <li>and so this is a great way for me to get some magnesium into my system for better sleep.</li>
            <li>Now, everyone in my household is happy I&#x27;ve discovered this product, and we can all get on with our lives. :)</li>
            <li>I am very glad to have found DeodoMom.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of use...I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I especially love how they put my name on the jar and spelled it right too</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s aluminum/fragrance/chemical-free, and the personalized packaging is a cute touch, too!!</li>
            <li>No residue, no fragrance, it&#x27;s just magic!</li>
            <li>Store bought milk of magnesia works much better!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I must share how pleased I am with this deodorant!</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied and recommend everyone to give it a try!</li>
            <li>Maybe I should have purchased the roll on, which would have given me better coverage!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>It works better than my store bought, aluminum deodorant!</li>
            <li>I bought the DeodoMom cream and love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try this as an oil control makeup primer since many ladies claim milk of magnesia is a wonderful super oily face mattifier.</li>
            <li>This product has been amazing for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how well DeodoMom works with just two ingredients.</li>
            <li>DeodoMom is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks, DeodoMom for this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>This is just an idea which I haven&#x27;t experimented greatly with yet, so please do feel free to take whatever approach you want</li>
            <li>DeodoMom is great because it truly does leaves me odor free.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, even when I have to skip a shower.</li>
            <li>So, I do sweat a lot using this when it&#x27;s warm, and I have to pick and choose what kinds of shirts I can wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of nice that it is unscented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an occupational therapy intern at an acute psychiatric hospital.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any problems with stained clothes, which is nice</li>
            <li>Follow-up: I now make my own DeodoMom.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t really need a &#x27;perfect recipe&#x27; to do it.</li>
            <li>I have saved a lot of money by making my own.</li>
            <li>This product is effective in controlling odor.  </li>
            <li>I honestly was scared to try this stuff, but</li>
            <li>which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>She is thrilled that after her dance class each week, she doesn&#x27;t smell like she was just dancing for 4 hrs.</li>
            <li>because, honestly, it works.</li>
            <li>I use the jar kind.</li>
            <li>They were really nice and cared about their service.</li>
            <li>I am grateful that your product is effective.</li>
            <li>so now my deo smells like vanilla and is very meoisturizing and still works great!</li>
            <li>my armpit was kind of smelly (before I was using antiperspirant), but I noticed that this improved after a month or so.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how this stuff can be so effective at controlling odor.</li>
            <li>I, however, cannot relax when in the company of my own smelly arm</li>
            <li>This deodorant works perfect and is all natural!!  </li>
            <li>So very pleased to find a safe deodorant that works so well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and extremely effective:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say I am finally happy with a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is a milk of magnesia cream that works great and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Its very easy</li>
            <li>I have the cream and it spreads very easy</li>
            <li>The cream is very easy and not messy/</li>
            <li>The best part is that it is all natural!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love using a product that is so safe it could be routinely ingested!  </li>
            <li>It is by far the purest in ingredients AND works the best!</li>
            <li>Reading the great reviews, I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant I have tried, and I have tried all kinds of natural ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find the perfect natural deodorant for quite some time now.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a suitable alternative deodorant for years.</li>
            <li>I gave this 5 Stars because it works very well; and this product has the perfect balance for easy application.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, love it!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a good product!</li>
            <li>Thanks to DeodoMom for fantastic customer service and great product!</li>
            <li>He loved the natural ingredients that didn&#x27;t stain his clothes, and it did a great job of keeping body odor at</li>
            <li>I did a bunch of searching and experimenting with non-aluminum deodorants and was pretty happy when I found this product.  </li>
            <li>I found a link and review to DeodoMom and thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Was it too good to be true?</li>
            <li>The cream works better for me.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to say that I have ended my hunt because this stuff REALLY works.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be getting it again.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY deodorants without aluminum to decrease my risk of breast cancer and Alzheimer disease (just in case).</li>
            <li>Love, love, love deodo mom.</li>
            <li>I Love knowing that my baby is not ingesting aluminum from antiperspirants as I breastfeed.</li>
            <li>I think my search for the best aluminum-free deodorant is finally over.  </li>
            <li>And trust me, this deodorant has gone through my most stressful days-</li>
            <li>I have told many people about this product and have no complaints about it except one with myself for not having discovered it sooner.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this deodorant, I bought it for my mom, husband and tell my friends about it too.</li>
            <li>You get more product for your money and its cheaper.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more convenient and just works better, couldn&#x27;t tell you why though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s texture is more like a lotion and not a cream, but it works.</li>
            <li>I prefer the roll-on most days because of the convenience factor, but when I have some time I do the jar as it allows me to put on a thicker coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love about this stuff</li>
            <li>I went with the jar instead of the roll on as the review thought that it worked better.</li>
            <li>The company says this should appeal to women more than men.  </li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m male and it just suits me perfectly.  </li>
            <li>And while I&#x27;m NOT an expecting mother, I LOVE DeodoMom.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the roll on so that might be more convenient for some people.</li>
            <li>And, I&#x27;m assuming with no aluminum or alcohol that this is much better for me than the OTC antiperspirant (which I love using for anti-sweat and scent, but</li>
            <li>we are always looking for healthy products to use that will not put chemicals on to our skin.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant works better</li>
            <li>love DeodoMom-</li>
            <li>And best of all is the low price.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is not loaded up with chemicals.</li>
            <li>had seen this recommend by another breast cancer lady in a forum discussion on finding healthy products.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did</li>
            <li>Of all the products I replaced a healthier alternative deodorant was the most challenging.</li>
            <li>And it was the most important!</li>
            <li>I just want something safe that works.</li>
            <li>It would be better in a pump.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they all work well for someone.</li>
            <li>I tried both this (the DeodoMom cream) and the DeodoMom roll on, and the cream worked better for me than the roll on.</li>
            <li>I love that you have the option of a cream or roll on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since last summer, and have had a great experience!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others, but I will continue to purchase this over and over again.  </li>
            <li>so I was able to sample.</li>
            <li>I plan to be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li>I am going to try the roll-on version and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>They shipped to me for free!  </li>
            <li>Now I have more deo too..</li>
            <li>They personalize the jar by printing out your name on a label for the top.</li>
            <li>I thought that was cute.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I also missed having a scent, though I know many will appreciate that it is unscented.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose I wanted to like it more than I did.</li>
            <li>and I spend most of the time working on my computer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>She said it was like a miracle :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It keeps me smell free and no rashes!</li>
            <li>you are looking for a safe deodorant, give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>Most of them give me rashes.</li>
            <li>The jar even had my name and a date on it :)</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t like that this was unscented, although I know that&#x27;s a plus for many people.</li>
            <li>Never again, Truly&#x27;s is much better.</li>
            <li>Words cannot explain the sheer joy this product has brought to my life!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe to use</li>
            <li>besides that nothing extra, this stuff is perfect for the toughest athletes!</li>
            <li>Possibly the best deodorant ever!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and it works without harming me with toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most of them contained baking soda</li>
            <li>Well boy am I glad that I purchased this product because it truly was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Magically, my underarms didn&#x27;t smell musky and I was amazed.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t burn more than the deo combo accident</li>
            <li>And more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many, many of the non-toxic fragrance-free deodorants out there, at every cost point.</li>
            <li>Most did nothing.</li>
            <li>I Have been looking for strong, safe healthy deodorant</li>
            <li>Easy to use and no horrible chemicals!!!!</li>
            <li>absolutely perfect, keeps you dry all day, no residue, no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve found and also love that its free of toxins and metals.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find a non toxic deodorant that works, for my daughter, THANKS!!!</li>
            <li>have the jar which is fine, but over time it seems like it&#x27;s solidified more (perhaps with air exposure), and thus compacted quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using DeodoMom for about 3-4 weeks with amazing success.</li>
            <li>even more importantly I don&#x27;t have any concerns about toxic chemicals being leached into my bloodstream.</li>
            <li>I no longer use drugstore deodorant - in addition to being 100% natural, this is much more effective!</li>
            <li>This one is great for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>Great product so far.</li>
            <li>DeodoMom Cream deodorant is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Lucky mofo!!!!!! But he always tells me I smell good not gross when I go the natural route.</li>
            <li>love knowing that I can be odor free without risking my health for the sake of hygiene.p</li>
            <li>I received the product on a special Sunday delivery, one day before estimated delivery!</li>
            <li>So happy to have something with good simple ingredients that really works!</li>
            <li>I thought this one would be an exception due to the excellent reviews, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Originally bought it for my 8 &amp; 11 year-old daughters because of the limited ingredients, but found that it worked great for me too!</li>
            <li>This product is very mild to the skin and lasts all day- even through the hottest of summer days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well.  </li>
            <li>This is a great and much needed product I will purchase the product again, thank you for producing something useful</li>
            <li>Neither are easy to get out of your body once they are at toxic</li>
            <li>but it dries very quickly so its still easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and lasts awhile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;****Update****&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong and working through this tropical summer.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company directly for a sample of the roll on, they were very courteous and sent me a free sample as I wanted to try the roll on before reordering the cream.  </li>
            <li>When I first got this product, it was a nice creamy consistency, like lotion.</li>
            <li>I am now forever their loyal customer!  </li>
            <li>Good to note, I&#x27;ve used it daily for over six weeks to give it ample time before posting a review and have experienced no negative side effects or disappointments to date.  </li>
            <li>the substance seemed mild and safe, it had only 2 ingredients, it didn&#x27;t leave too many marks, and it had good reviews.</li>
            <li>no matter what, I break out into a huge rash and feel the pain for weeks.</li>
            <li>The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective natural deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li>: I had much better success with Deodomom over Lavilin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this deoderant for a few weeks now and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>The texture is a water light lotion.</li>
            <li>This is a great product - have been using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li>And, it has no harmful chemicals in it which is important to me as I was just treated for breast cancer and told by my doctors to avoid aluminum in deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation and it went on smoothly (hence the 2 stars)</li>
            <li>the people at DeodoMom sent me the cream for free.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast too, which is nice.</li>
            <li>It ain&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>I have used both the cream and the roll-on, and both are gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t comfortable using those.</li>
            <li>I have also tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine (fragrance free), and feel that DeodoMom is far superior both in terms of effectiveness and ingredients.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried all the rest of so call natural deodorants and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin, did not irritate my underarms.</li>
            <li>Compared to another natural deodorant I tried, I wasn&#x27;t sure this was as effective at neutralizing odor.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for about 5 days and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I liked my old antiperspirant because it smelled lovely and perfumey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>, I was so happy to find this deodorant two years ago while I was breastfeeding, and continued to use it while pregnant and breastfeeding with my second.</li>
            <li>Based off the products I have used in the past, this deodorant as worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>As long as I&#x27;m odor-free, I&#x27;m happy and my clothes don&#x27;t stink like pit smell anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much!  </li>
            <li>Its totally worth the money and will be stocking up soon!  </li>
            <li>Does not work for me, I was still sweating and did not feel fresh!</li>
            <li>If you try to use on armpits that arent clean it won&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and most have not worked as well as the non natural deodorant that I was using.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I continue to look for a perfect natural deodorant is because of the application of both.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You must have clean pits for it to work, so I put it on after I shower in the morning and again at night before I go to bed if I want to squeeze another day out of</li>
            <li>Deodomom leaves a clean feeling even when you sweat.</li>
            <li>There are so many great reviews,  I don&#x27;t want to be redundant, but suffice it to say that this stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless products to address my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; and this has been one of the most effective...</li>
            <li>It even works incredibly for more than 24 hours as I have slept in really late on my days off.  </li>
            <li>(yes, really), and odor free!</li>
            <li>This seemed so safe and works very well -just as well as all the clinical strength \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ingredient deodorants with aluminum in them.</li>
            <li>After a lifetime of wearing the big name anti-restaurants and deodorants, I have FINALLY found something I know is safe AND works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>This product works for a full 24 hrs after I apply it.</li>
            <li>This would probably be an effective deodorant for someone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t have a history of experiencing armpit lumps from deodorants.</li>
            <li>Good product,  lasted about 2 months of daily use &amp; I&#x27;m re-ordering.</li>
            <li>If you get used to applying it with your fingers instead of the standard roll-on or swipe on kind, it works really good at preventing perspiration naturally.  </li>
            <li>, it may be a good idea to mix a soothing mixture with a lower pH (possibly with lemon juice) to dab on your underarms each night for some time.</li>
            <li>Seems too good to be true, but it&#x27;s now my daily experience.</li>
            <li>I told them and they immediately sent me a new one for free :)</li>
            <li>I wish the roll on did work for me, since its easier to apply, but the cream is easy enough to apply on its own.</li>
            <li>Works great on my very sensitive skin and no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;After trying a number of natural formula products, I finally found something that is safe, effective, and truly works!</li>
            <li>I am an active person (run, cycle, triathlons) and this works great through all those activities.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident knowing it is safe enough to eat.</li>
            <li>so body odor can quickly become a problem almost any time of the year.</li>
            <li>The jar doesn&#x27;t seem to be good enough to keep the product fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now; I started using it before I was pregnant and am still using it while nursing.</li>
            <li>I found deodomom cream while pregnant and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about as mild on your skin as a product can be.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night, right after my shower, and I smell fresh throughout the day!</li>
            <li>More effective than any other aluminum-free crystal, spray, or stick</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t been very impressed with other natural deodorants that I have tried.</li>
            <li>We have only used it in winter, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the cream version, and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Given that it&#x27;s all in a simple and safe ingredient this has been a very big win for me.  </li>
            <li>I would really like to give this 5 stars as I have tried about 6 different deodorants and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I do sometimes sweat because it is a deodorant not an anti-perspirant, but I do not mind so long as I smell good.</li>
            <li>While baking soda might be a huge step above the aluminum based deodorants, it is a very powerful substance that can cause irritation and over-abrasion in many people.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try it!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my natural deodorant search is over!</li>
            <li>I feel like I sweat easily and have tried lots of different deodorants, even &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength ones, but this one still works so much better those.</li>
            <li>For now I certainly appreciate that it is fragrance free and WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>works okay for natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>This works better than any non-aluminum deodorant I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I avoid aluminum products because they make me sweat more, but that leaves a plethora of natural deodorants that do not work well on odor.</li>
            <li>So anyway, I gave it 3-star review because it did keep body odor away for a few days, which was slightly impressive for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used natural deodorants for years and have never found one I liked this much.</li>
            <li>On the fourth day, it seemed to not be effective anymore.  </li>
            <li>Had to write a review on this as i&#x27;m sure there are people out there struggling to find a natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far for me, the DeodoMom has been working a lot better than Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I also liked the Pit Powder about the same.</li>
            <li>Not unhappy, just curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely light creme and a tiny bit on finger tip smoothed over the under arm area</li>
            <li>It does make the underarm a bit white, but honestly, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li>I finally found a deordorant that is effective at neutralizing underarm odor.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried EVERY natural solution possible from powders to crystals to pastes and is is by far the BEST one.</li>
            <li>I have been using the cream for a few weeks now and so far it has been great!  </li>
            <li>this wasn&#x27;t *too* much of a problem, but there were definitely times where I thought deodorant might be a good idea.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was pretty quick, and the product had to travel cross country, and the personalized lid label was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, convenient, lasts a long time, safe, and by all means effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried so many other natural deoderants, but none work anywere near as good as this!  </li>
            <li>30someweeks was great sending me a replacement order for free when I complained about the first shipment leaking.</li>
            <li>I still sweat somewhat with this at times (which is to be expected) and on a really hot day I may stink a tiny bit, but this is one of the best that I can find.</li>
            <li>cream-- is soothing even right after shaving.</li>
            <li>(But you can&#x27;t just give up, right?).</li>
            <li>To be honest I do first apply some medicated powder for that extra protection when I work out.</li>
            <li>Not sure why this is, but I am ok with it since it&#x27;s such a good price and for those 3 days it does seem to be more effective than my other natural deodorant stand-by (which just masks the BO with a lovely scent).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing and is very gentle on freshly shaven skin as well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try this if you&#x27;re looking for an aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>I live a very humid part of TX, so no matter what I use, I have to apply more than once a day.</li>
            <li>I have a very very sensitive skin and so does my spouse, this deoderant is effective and soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>A small amount works great</li>
            <li>Have been trying various natural deodorants for the last 4 years and wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results until I tried DeodoMom.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to other products, this stuff is amazing!!  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly in a cute package with a little label with my name written on it on top of the jar.</li>
            <li>I found lotion to be more effective than roll-on, although perhaps I lather the lotion on too thickly.  </li>
            <li>The Crystal, for example, was effective in the short term, but gave me really irritated skin after repeated use.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still getting used to the feeling of sweating more, but really, this is the first natural deodorant I can see myself sticking with.  </li>
            <li>My order was received very fast and I began to use immediately.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very picky about the products he uses, and after trying MANY different natural deodorants he settled on this one as his favorite.</li>
            <li>After a long day, especially if it&#x27;s warm, I do feel a little stinky - but that happens with any deodorant.  </li>
            <li>And it comes in a cute little pot with your name on it, very boutiquish :)</li>
            <li>:) And, on the plus side, my shirts no longer get yellow stains since this stuff doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both the roll-on and the jar and prefer the roll-on simply because it&#x27;s more convenient.  </li>
            <li>I think the cream actually works better.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>First I tried Himalayan salt.</li>
            <li>It has never burned and it really works!</li>
            <li>Love this simple, vegan deodorant.</li>
            <li>Works all day unless its a particularly hot day.</li>
            <li>I am a recent breast cancer survivor - 8 months cancer free!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>PS, my husband is so much happier now!</li>
            <li>She was hesitant at first about the &amp;#34;applying it with your fingers&amp;#34; aspect of it.  </li>
            <li>and she really loves it!  </li>
            <li>But I couldn&#x27;t give it 5-stars because I experienced a negative reaction to it.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t have to look anymore!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks, DeodoMom!</li>
            <li>With that said, when I first got the DeodoMom ( i have the jar)</li>
            <li>This product keeps me smelling fresh the whole day with just one application.  </li>
            <li>This product works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>so I have hot and humidity working against me and with body chemistry</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope the next one you try does.</li>
            <li>Plus, this is entirely aluminum free (unliked the salt deoderants, which contain aluminum!).  </li>
            <li>only thing he didn&#x27;t like was that after putting it on, his armpits felt more moist than with stick deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have every written.  </li>
            <li>I am willing to write a review because I feel everyone should know about this product and use it.  </li>
            <li>DeodoMom is safe, non-toxic and actually works!  </li>
            <li>I used to carry deodorant in my purse to reapply, but with deodomom just the one application first thing in the morning lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is the first deodorant that has worked for me in years and years.</li>
            <li>family first though.  </li>
            <li>I placed my first order on Amazon and in days it arrived.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands as well as homemade versions</li>
            <li>It is always possible I used more than the recommended amount, but I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands - all the big ones you&#x27;ve probably tried too</li>
            <li>It does not cause me any irritation and it stops me from sweating even during the hot days of summer.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t have to invest so much in magnesium hydroxide!</li>
            <li>More often than not, my underarms would become red and burn, or else</li>
            <li>You cannot get much safer than the ingredient in this product!</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered it, it was cracked and spilled all over the package.</li>
            <li>When I shower my under arms are free from any residue that my old deodorants would leave.</li>
            <li>It dried quickly when applied and never felt sticky, which was nice.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products - some of them are too greasy or not as effective.</li>
            <li>It even keeps me dry most of the time, and that is better than I can say for most anti-perpirants that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>It generally works all day just fine.  </li>
            <li>A majority of effective hypoallergenic deodorants that are EFFECTIVE are so expensive, so with the $10 price tag and recommendations I found online</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that it is natural, only two ingredients, and effective.</li>
            <li>since it obviously works for many others and shipped really promptly</li>
            <li>I accept my wetness as a natural means of cooling off, but this product (along with daily underarm washing) is finally an effective defense against the smell.</li>
            <li>At least my son and husband had a good laugh at my expense.  </li>
            <li>Still, I was able to rub the paste on w/ the same results so it didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>truly appreciate how few ingredients this has and how it is touted as being safe and toxin-free, but another important question of course is how well does it deodorize?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lived many years feeling self conscious about the ineffective natural deodorants I was committed to sticking with, and then I found deodomom.</li>
            <li>So i had previously gotten the roll on version which I absolutely love!</li>
            <li>and I saw a trend of positive feedback.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t all of the positive reviews...</li>
            <li>Saw positive reviews for this, so thought we&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li>when the first jar they sent me got broken in the mail, they were really nice and sent me a free replacement right away.</li>
            <li>First of all, some background on me - I really want to use aluminum free/natural deodorants</li>
            <li>Like many people who are allergic to the aluminum found in almost all antiperspirant-deodorant products, I have been looking for an alternative for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I am a dancer and when I first tried the deodorant, I was dancing for 6 hours straight in an intensive.</li>
            <li>Using a small amount dries the area and surprisingly works all day.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and it is hot!  </li>
            <li>After research (Home Pharmacy has a good Q&amp;amp;A) and finding that the crystal deodorant stone is actually a form of aluminum, as my primary provider naturopath warned me, I found this product, and it is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Blocking the natural process of release of fluid with aluminum is probably an unsafe methodology, and given the high rate of breast cancer</li>
            <li>I am impatient, so I just use a hairdryer on the cool setting.:)</li>
            <li>I really liked using this product for the first few days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of alternative products, and nothing has beaten this in terms of efficacy, and certainly nothing comes close in terms of purity.</li>
            <li>after 2 to 3 hours sweating the protection is not longer there, I live in South Florida, this product isn&#x27;t strong enough for this type of climate, to be honest TOM&#x27;s natural deodorant offers more protection than this product for less money</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have used it for over a month and it really covers odors .The</li>
            <li>I trusted this one so much</li>
            <li>She was getting really embarrassed about her body odor.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this deodorant to work for me, but I guess it&#x27;s not compatible with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>I really like that DeodoMom is unscented.  </li>
            <li>I put it on after my morning shower and am still stink free when I wake up next morning.</li>
            <li>i have struggled my whole life with stinkiness....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love that there are absolutely no harmful ingredients in this deodorant.</li>
            <li>this did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Deodomom.</li>
            <li>Dries up FAST -</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what happened</li>
            <li>Well not totally sweat free</li>
            <li>I was very optimistic</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant, and will absolutely continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really have no problems with smelling or sweating when I use it.</li>
            <li>but it dries fast</li>
            <li>It does run out sort of fast</li>
            <li>but I may be using too much at a time.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it and it works for everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>DeodoMom is a deodorant not an antiperspirant and works no matter how much I sweat.  </li>
            <li>Being a professional woman, I need to stay fresh all day.</li>
            <li>This product works, even during the summer on very stressful days.</li>
            <li>so much I have ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to suffer that much</li>
            <li>and it really works for me, takes the odor and lets me sweat.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>Someone very close to me mentioned that I haven&#x27;t had any funk at all since using this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I found myself having to reapply it, even without much sweating.</li>
            <li>Really like that there are no chemicals/toxins</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this product and am hooked.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t reek as much as I might if I hadn&#x27;t used this, but my pits still smell like pits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s alright for wearing after a shower and going straight to bed...</li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost 2 months now and have absolutely zero complaints.</li>
            <li>I tried many natural deodorants but they all left me stinky after a while.</li>
            <li>Glad I investigated something natural, I will never go back to OTC.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a natural deodorant with simple, safe ingredients that works for years.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t like scented deodorant - especially after it mixes with my own odor.  </li>
            <li>Another positive is that it takes very little of the product to be effective.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this product, the only drawback is in the nature of the ingredient to dry up/dissolve in air.</li>
            <li>It has been fairly hot where I live and</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful deoderant alternative to the common ones that contain aluminum and other harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to deodorants and this is the first I have found that does not cause a reaction.  </li>
            <li>She seemed to really like it and found that it worked just as good if not better than the old stuff.</li>
            <li>Then it began to dry out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It would be a much cheaper solution than the high end brand of mattifier I use now.</li>
            <li>Need very little to be effective.</li>
            <li>So I have been searching for an effective natural deodorant down through the years and only one of them seemed to work mildly</li>
            <li>This was one of three deodorants I purchased when I started to get an allergic reaction to regular deodorants/antiperspirants and looked for a more sensitive, natural product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many natural deodorants and this is the only one that&lt;br /&gt;has completely eliminated any body odor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking out a safe alternative to conventional deodorants.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve experienced is, strangely, a few pimples when I first made the switch; but once they went away, they didn&#x27;t come back.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast even though I live in Hawaii and guess what?</li>
            <li>and I typically stink by noon at the latest.</li>
            <li>Even my previous favorite, PitPowder, had to be reapplied a couple times throughout the day in order to keep stinky-ness at bay.</li>
            <li>It keeps you dry and odor free even after workouts.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it was offered in a glass jar though, less plastic in the world is better.</li>
            <li>:) My only issue is that it&#x27;s definitely not an anti-perspirant, which I knew going into it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more of this one, however I give it 4 stars for now since I think $10 is a bit much for a few ounces of any deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Even many of the healthy ones have ingredients that make me uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Like many people trying to avoid harmful ingredients, I&#x27;ve tried countless natural antiperspirants like The Crystal and Tom&#x27;s with limited success.</li>
            <li>But not wearing silk, or light blue button up shirts to work in the summer is a small price to pay for being healthy and not stinky.</li>
            <li>I recommend for anyone who has body odor issues or just wants to make the switch to something natural without any glycol!</li>
            <li>It has a very high pH and is not always suitable for sensitive skin, especially when using it in a way which keeps it in contact with the skin for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I think both women and men (men also high in breast cancer occurrences) should look to products like this that are not &#x27;anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>came to my attention and came highly reviewed, so thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this deodorant for each member of the family.</li>
            <li>highly recommend that anyone give this a try.</li>
            <li>I tested high for aluminum and off the charts with zirconium in a health test.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and am buying another one for my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if it would have worked in my teens and 20s when hormones are high.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but you do sweat using it in high heat.  </li>
            <li>milk of magnesia is high in pH</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother my very sensitive skin, it has no odor and has left me completely b.o. free at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to stop me from sweating a little better.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely try this first!</li>
            <li>How did this little company figure out how to make something that so many are trying to do?</li>
            <li>This deodorant worked fairly well (&amp; I have a really tough time finding any deodorant that works for me).</li>
            <li>After trying a couple dozen of natural and conventional deodorants I haven&#x27;t found a better option than deodomom.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for a natural, safe, deodorant that actually works.  </li>
            <li>i was really hoping this product would work because i&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant that truly does.</li>
            <li>The cream dries fast and can even be applied directly after shaving.</li>
            <li>I could also go 2 days without reapplying under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this product totally warrants it.</li>
            <li>mom got the last laugh.</li>
            <li>I was using a mix of normal Secret/Degree deodorant/antiperspirant and alternating with scented Tom&#x27;s deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no negative reactions to it at all.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many natural deodorants with no success.</li>
            <li>Its doesn&#x27;t smell, and I can put it on once in the morning and go all day without reapplying on a normal day.</li>
            <li>I love that I did not get a rash and that it still worked without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone is different so this may not work for you, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>If you use too much it gets a bit of a white film, but just well... don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li>jar only lasts me about 5 weeks but is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-This isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, but it&#x27;s a powerful deodorant and has worked for me immediately in removing musk even if I put it later on in the day and don&#x27;t wash up before applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS Wash/wipe this stuff off before applying normal deo bc</li>
            <li>And, honestly the paste was less likely to spill in my travel bag.</li>
            <li>I do have a reapply if its an active day, but a majority of the time, a morning-time application worked just fine.</li>
            <li>This stuff is crazy good!  </li>
            <li>I live in Tucson</li>
            <li>thank you for  this new creation that is now in my life, tangi hayes</li>
            <li>(and we live in Phoenix).&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>Strangely this product dries super fast and actually keeps your armpits dry and odor free.</li>
            <li>This stuff has definitely worked for me and I can&#x27;t say the same about the cheap store bought junk.</li>
            <li>I do miss the fresh scent of my old deodorant, but that was possibly one of the causes of the rash.</li>
            <li>(E Plus High C Natural roll-on deodorant by Aubrey Organics).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone looking for a natural deo alternative.</li>
            <li>I sweat easily, so I reapply it a couple of times in between showers if I have worked out or been very active.</li>
            <li>I wear it daily and live in FL where it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>love the cream version of their product and they now have a lifelong customer - MY SEARCH IS OVER!!!!</li>
            <li>It works better than any store bought organic deodorant I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>What makes DeodoMom unique from other products, is it&#x27;s effectiveness at neutralizing odor.</li>
            <li>I love that the product is made in small batches to ensurefreshness and was custom made when I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is made so simply, which is exactly what I look for in products, and for me it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most of us had been trying the usual drug store deodorant products that did not contain aluminum, but had found they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I have worn it to hot yoga several times</li>
            <li>This deodorant works better than a lot of other things (such as the salt crystal) and it didn&#x27;t make me feel like I smelled like a hippie.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t really natural!  </li>
            <li>I had problems with other aluminum free, all natural deodorants until I purchased this one.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>t bought the jar and it was full, within a week it was almost empty.  </li>
            <li>I guess my armpit got used to it and got mostly clean from the residuals of other deodorants.</li>
            <li>as it&#x27;s more eco conscious, so I&#x27;ll probably buy it in the other container next time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light invisible and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for years for a product that did not smell like patchouli and kept me dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>Also, this is the first natural deodorant I have found that actually controls odor and perspiration -- even in the summer time.</li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that hasn&#x27;t caused a rash &amp; it actually works!</li>
            <li>noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically jog or do weights a few times a week, and spend time outdoors and walking on weekends, so it hasn&#x27;t gotten the full gamut of my own personal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream seemed kind of weird at first</li>
            <li>This is literally the first and only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever purchased that WORKED.</li>
            <li>and I am very surprised by how it has worked so far.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve struggled to find an effective, safe deodorant, I highly recommend trying it (even if you&#x27;re a dude and a little gun shy about the name).</li>
            <li>Its better than normal deodorants and no more Aluminum!</li>
            <li>The only slight drawback is that you have to wait a minute or so after applying before putting your top on.</li>
            <li>Somehow, I doubt it (I was stinky in the winter with the other natural brands and not at all with this, so that&#x27;s a lot of encouragement right there!)</li>
            <li>I love that there are minimal ingredients, and it is one of the only natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used that not only doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin, but also works.  </li>
            <li>After trying several natural deodorants, I was about to give up hope of discovering something that worked for me as well as aluminum products, but this little jar of magic truly does.  </li>
            <li>I have also been on the search for what feels like my whole life to find a natural deo that actually works.</li>
            <li>I have bought every natural deodorant under the sun trying to find one that works.</li>
            <li>It actually works very well.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what happens with a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural deodorant that works for years.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this works.</li>
            <li>During the time I was going through 11 months of treatment, I was looking for an all natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying natural deodorants for about 4-5 years with no luck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not concerned about sweating, because that is a natural process.  </li>
            <li>Also, I know putting lotion deodorant on seems strange at first, but I was putting lotion under my arms anyway</li>
            <li>but that was FAR from the case for me as man.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>version so far.</li>
            <li>It has no smell yet takes care of any body odors that would naturally occur.</li>
            <li>I had been using another natural, non-aluminum cream deodorant for about a year when I decided to try DeodoMom.  </li>
            <li>Since switching to deodomom, the rash has completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to switch to all natural products as my fiancé</li>
            <li>Always let it try completely before putting on clothing.</li>
            <li>I was really so surprised.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this deodorant</li>
            <li>Even with the non natural deodorant, I still had some issues with sweating and stinking.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t used natural deodorant options before, you should know ahead of time that they will not prevent you from sweating, but they do minimize or eliminate odor from sweat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried zillions of natural deodorants, and it seems to be just trial and error to determine what works well with your body chemistry.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, any natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t work for you just doesn&#x27;t work for *</li>
            <li>So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 9 year old son who has been wearing deodorant since he was 4.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something natural to replace Degree for myself and my son.</li>
            <li>I recommend this deodorant to anyone that is looking to find a natural brand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Since then I have tried all of the natural brands sold in health food stores (Tom&#x27;s, Kiss</li>
            <li>I switched to the Soapwalla brand deodorant cream, which is all natural and comes in a jar.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything on the market that had natural claims and nothing worked at all.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and asked if I would compromise the effectiveness of their product by adding some vanilla essential oil diluted with jojoba and they gave me immediate feedback and suggestions on how much to add</li>
            <li>I have never found ANY natural products that worked as well as Deodomom deodorant.  </li>
            <li>its natural</li>
            <li>no reactions thus far.</li>
            <li>Having gone through this countless times before, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>What surprised me was that despite not having used this product a lot, when I opened it one day, it appeared to be disintegrating.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts and itiching  </li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural deodorant and found this.</li>
            <li>DeodoMom really surprised me.</li>
            <li>but I developed a sensitivity to one of the ingredients and had to quit using it.  </li>
            <li>so I would still recommend trying it if you&#x27;re looking for a natural, scentless deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every natural deodorant I could - homemade, store bought - nothing worked.</li>
            <li>However, some of the crystal types irritated my sensitive skin, so I tried this one.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything natural when it comes to deodorant and have found nothing that compares to DeodoMom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>sure on longevity of the jar, as it is fairly small, but I&#x27;m guessing it should last me at least 2 months, and I plan to buy more</li>
            <li>One more tip, if it starts it starts to dry out in the container, just add a touch of water to it and maybe mix slightly.</li>
            <li>I just got tired of the calamine lotion-like scent of E Plus High C and wondered if there was something better out there.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to twist the lid on tight bc it will dry up faster if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I also bought the roll-on and had the same exact results (massive stank).</li>
            <li>additionally peri-menopause has left me more sweaty than usual, so the cream has passed the test with me.  </li>
            <li>so I usually have to put some olive oil on my underarms at night and a dab of perfume oils in the day for that extra girly magic,</li>
            <li>The roll-on version of the product travels better, but takes a little longer to dry after applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled to find a deodorant that really cuts down on odor while not irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all the potential stinky girls (and guys) refusing to lift their arms at work!</li>
            <li>After years of trying various natural deodorant I have finally found one that really works.  </li>
            <li>Not only because of the toxic chemicals, but because after a month or two, they seem to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants claim to allow your body to perspire normally, and focus on covering up any odor.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little white residue where the product went on, but it comes off in an instant with a little water or a slightly damp cloth, so it&#x27;s great for days where one is wearing black or a tank top.  </li>
            <li>This one actually works, and I live in AZ where its already over 100 degrees.</li>
            <li>read the ingredient list of your other deodorants, and you might not feel comfortable rubbing that into your skin every single day.</li>
            <li>It works very well and kept me dry.  </li>
            <li>, I keep my jar in a ziploc bag and suck out the air before sealing so it doesn&#x27;t dry out as fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very concerned about the things in commercial deodorant, such as aluminum that can absorb through your skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many brands of deodorants (Degree, Tom&#x27;s, Secret, Speed Stick, Arm and Hammer, Axe, old spice) and</li>
            <li>I went on the search for all natural deodorant recipes and all natural commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li>The cream effectively masks odor but started to give me a rash because it still contains skin irritating ingredients such as lavender, tea tree, and peppermint.</li>
            <li>The application is a little different, but I got used to it and feel it really does stand up to some hot sweaty days.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have found a deodorant with natural ingredients, no harsh chemicals, and just a few ingredients THAT WORKS!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants and this is the winner!</li>
            <li>and I think I finally found my natural deodorant!</li>
            <li>I finally found a natural deodorant that works!  </li>
            <li>This actually worked better than regular deodorants I had in the past, and I sweat a LOT bro.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m now on week 3 and most of the time not only do I smell nothing at all from a long day at work or even after working out, I am somehow sweating significantly less than with my former anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve slowly been moving to more natural products, and other all natural deoderants were not working.</li>
            <li>To me it is worth that little trade off for actually having a natural product that works.</li>
            <li>It is odorless, it does not stain your clothes, and it greatly reduces the bad odor caused by sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oana</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this product and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh or irritating ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>What I am concerned about is body odor, and this is the only natural deodorant product that has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried various deodorants since deciding to find a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>After years of \\&quot;trying out\\&quot; organic and natural deodorant products, I have finally found one that works!</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that works, and it works damn well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous all natural deodorants</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this only for 5 days, but so far I am hooked.</li>
            <li>I had resigned to using old spice for the last 4 years</li>
            <li>It can last for 1 to 2 days between showers, and it hasn&#x27;t irritated anyone&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant I have tried that keeps my underarms from being smelly and does so for over 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>Finding an all natural deodorant that actually works AND does not give me an allergic reaction is my &amp;#34;white whale&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is a soft, white cream.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural deodorant without all the chemicals in the regular ones.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find a natural deodorant that actually worked for me, but this one wasn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>I struggle with a magnesium deficiency that causes a number of issues from anxiety, restless leg syndrome, headaches - and apparently body odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few months, and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>I was tired of using antiperspirants with so many chemicals and would on occasions cause severe skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure those other deodorants made me smell worse (especially the baking soda brand).</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll figure out the right amount for you after a few days.</li>
            <li>Its very simple and totally worth the little effort.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the cream so far, and plan on trying the roll on next.</li>
            <li>I was about to give up hope and go back to the commercial un natural brands, but I came across DeodoMom.</li>
            <li>Most of them ether didn&#x27;t work much or actually made me smell worse.</li>
            <li>Initial packaging was poor but replacement package was much better.</li>
            <li>No rash, though at first it tingled a little when I applied it.</li>
            <li>Everybody&#x27;s chemistry is different, but for us it works like no other we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I am very antichemical and refuse to expose my body to your average chemical laden deodorant.  </li>
            <li>i went ALL DAY ( a normal day around the house) with absolutely NO BO.  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;ll say that I do sweat and sometimes heavily even when sitting idle at my desk for periods of time.  </li>
            <li>In my quest to find a deodorant without aluminum, I have tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands that I&#x27;ve found both at major grocery chains and smaller health food stores.</li>
            <li>Im a military blue collar worker who normally has to shower 3 times a day to control the stench.</li>
            <li>I have been going CRAZY trying to find something that works, wasting a lot of time and money, not to mention, sacrificing some relationships, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li>The quantity was much less than I remembered being left - I knew I had not used that much -</li>
            <li>It only seems to fail if I have had an especially long and sweaty day, but most normal days</li>
            <li>I got this one just to save the extra few bucks after my roll on was all gone thinking it would work exactly the same just different packaging.</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant, but it really only lasts a little over a month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely natural and can be fixed by adding a little water and then mixing well.&lt;br /&gt;-Because</li>
            <li>Applying with my fingers was a little strange at first, but soon became no big deal, though I will try the roll on next for comparison.  </li>
            <li>I was using the crystal deodorant, with good results, until the People&#x27;s Pharmacy said it is made of alum, which is aluminum, and still could possibly be bad for you.</li>

            <li> I like, this has been the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say Deodomom and Jason in apricot scent are the best, but the Jason&#x27;s leaves underarms feeling sticky when you begin to sweat.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed</li>
            <li> This works brilliantly on me!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> it is greatly reduced and it smells like sweat not some ultra foul odor multiplied by 10!&lt;br /&gt;YAY!</li>
            <li> I was using the Organic Island deodorant which was also wonderful</li>
            <li> So impressed with this.</li>
            <li> You may want to experiment yourself and figure out which amount is best for you.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It smells great too.  </li>
            <li> Was great for about 5 days.</li>
            <li> And for once I can say I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> so it is a great value.</li>
            <li> recommended this product to my sisters, who also agreed it is great, and they have both switched to DeodoMom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The company is great.  </li>

            <li> Great for people who sweat often and</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Who would of thought constipation medicine would be a great pit deodorant.</li>
            <li> Both work great.  </li>
            <li> I gave this cream deodorant a try, not thinking it would work, and it was great.</li>
            <li> For me it was a great find, and I will continue to use</li>
            <li> frankincense and myrrh are a great combo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Amazing deodorant!</li>
            <li> amazing!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have tried it now, and it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This seems to work the best and is safe.</li>
            <li> And I do not smell good...</li>
            <li> and then when I have done that I am good to go.</li>
            <li> I was using Jungleman deodorant and LOVED it, but it started to bother my skin</li>
            <li> It still allows you to sweat which is a good thing</li>
            <li> even after a good work out at the gym.</li>
            <li> Over-all, good product.</li>
            <li> or so I can get another 3 good days out of it.  </li>
            <li> I stay &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; free all day, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the roll-on and cream and found them both good.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I did not use this on a long-term basis, but I will offer my opinion based on when I did use it and on</li>
            <li> It is a really good option</li>
            <li> and so this is a great way for me to get some magnesium into my system for better sleep.</li>
            <li> Now, everyone in my household is happy I&#x27;ve discovered this product, and we can all get on with our lives. :)</li>
            <li> I am very glad to have found DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use...I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I especially love how they put my name on the jar and spelled it right too</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s aluminum/fragrance/chemical-free, and the personalized packaging is a cute touch, too!!</li>
            <li> No residue, no fragrance, it&#x27;s just magic!</li>
            <li> Store bought milk of magnesia works much better!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I must share how pleased I am with this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied and recommend everyone to give it a try!</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have purchased the roll on, which would have given me better coverage!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> It works better than my store bought, aluminum deodorant!</li>
            <li> I bought the DeodoMom cream and love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try this as an oil control makeup primer since many ladies claim milk of magnesia is a wonderful super oily face mattifier.</li>
            <li> This product has been amazing for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how well DeodoMom works with just two ingredients.</li>
            <li> DeodoMom is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks, DeodoMom for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> This is just an idea which I haven&#x27;t experimented greatly with yet, so please do feel free to take whatever approach you want</li>
            <li> DeodoMom is great because it truly does leaves me odor free.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, even when I have to skip a shower.</li>
            <li> So, I do sweat a lot using this when it&#x27;s warm, and I have to pick and choose what kinds of shirts I can wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of nice that it is unscented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an occupational therapy intern at an acute psychiatric hospital.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems with stained clothes, which is nice</li>
            <li> Follow-up: I now make my own DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t really need a &#x27;perfect recipe&#x27; to do it.</li>
            <li> I have saved a lot of money by making my own.</li>
            <li> This product is effective in controlling odor.  </li>
            <li> I honestly was scared to try this stuff, but</li>
            <li> which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li> She is thrilled that after her dance class each week, she doesn&#x27;t smell like she was just dancing for 4 hrs.</li>
            <li> because, honestly, it works.</li>
            <li> I use the jar kind.</li>
            <li> They were really nice and cared about their service.</li>
            <li> I am grateful that your product is effective.</li>
            <li> so now my deo smells like vanilla and is very meoisturizing and still works great!</li>
            <li> my armpit was kind of smelly (before I was using antiperspirant), but I noticed that this improved after a month or so.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this stuff can be so effective at controlling odor.</li>
            <li> I, however, cannot relax when in the company of my own smelly arm</li>
            <li> This deodorant works perfect and is all natural!!  </li>
            <li> So very pleased to find a safe deodorant that works so well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and extremely effective:)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say I am finally happy with a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is a milk of magnesia cream that works great and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> Its very easy</li>
            <li> I have the cream and it spreads very easy</li>
            <li> The cream is very easy and not messy/</li>
            <li> The best part is that it is all natural!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love using a product that is so safe it could be routinely ingested!  </li>
            <li> It is by far the purest in ingredients AND works the best!</li>
            <li> Reading the great reviews, I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have tried, and I have tried all kinds of natural ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the perfect natural deodorant for quite some time now.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a suitable alternative deodorant for years.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 Stars because it works very well; and this product has the perfect balance for easy application.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, love it!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a good product!</li>
            <li> Thanks to DeodoMom for fantastic customer service and great product!</li>
            <li> He loved the natural ingredients that didn&#x27;t stain his clothes, and it did a great job of keeping body odor at</li>
            <li> I did a bunch of searching and experimenting with non-aluminum deodorants and was pretty happy when I found this product.  </li>
            <li> I found a link and review to DeodoMom and thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Was it too good to be true?</li>
            <li> The cream works better for me.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to say that I have ended my hunt because this stuff REALLY works.</li>
            <li> I love it and will be getting it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY deodorants without aluminum to decrease my risk of breast cancer and Alzheimer disease (just in case).</li>
            <li> Love, love, love deodo mom.</li>
            <li> I Love knowing that my baby is not ingesting aluminum from antiperspirants as I breastfeed.</li>
            <li> I think my search for the best aluminum-free deodorant is finally over.  </li>
            <li> And trust me, this deodorant has gone through my most stressful days-</li>
            <li> I have told many people about this product and have no complaints about it except one with myself for not having discovered it sooner.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant, I bought it for my mom, husband and tell my friends about it too.</li>
            <li> You get more product for your money and its cheaper.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more convenient and just works better, couldn&#x27;t tell you why though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s texture is more like a lotion and not a cream, but it works.</li>
            <li> I prefer the roll-on most days because of the convenience factor, but when I have some time I do the jar as it allows me to put on a thicker coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love about this stuff</li>
            <li> I went with the jar instead of the roll on as the review thought that it worked better.</li>
            <li> The company says this should appeal to women more than men.  </li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m male and it just suits me perfectly.  </li>
            <li> And while I&#x27;m NOT an expecting mother, I LOVE DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the roll on so that might be more convenient for some people.</li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;m assuming with no aluminum or alcohol that this is much better for me than the OTC antiperspirant (which I love using for anti-sweat and scent, but</li>
            <li> we are always looking for healthy products to use that will not put chemicals on to our skin.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant works better</li>
            <li> love DeodoMom-</li>
            <li> And best of all is the low price.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is not loaded up with chemicals.</li>
            <li> had seen this recommend by another breast cancer lady in a forum discussion on finding healthy products.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did</li>
            <li> Of all the products I replaced a healthier alternative deodorant was the most challenging.</li>
            <li> And it was the most important!</li>
            <li> I just want something safe that works.</li>
            <li> It would be better in a pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they all work well for someone.</li>
            <li> I tried both this (the DeodoMom cream) and the DeodoMom roll on, and the cream worked better for me than the roll on.</li>
            <li> I love that you have the option of a cream or roll on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since last summer, and have had a great experience!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many others, but I will continue to purchase this over and over again.  </li>
            <li> so I was able to sample.</li>
            <li> I plan to be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li> I am going to try the roll-on version and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> They shipped to me for free!  </li>
            <li> Now I have more deo too..</li>
            <li> They personalize the jar by printing out your name on a label for the top.</li>
            <li> I thought that was cute.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I also missed having a scent, though I know many will appreciate that it is unscented.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose I wanted to like it more than I did.</li>
            <li> and I spend most of the time working on my computer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I took</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> She said it was like a miracle :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It keeps me smell free and no rashes!</li>
            <li> you are looking for a safe deodorant, give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> Most of them give me rashes.</li>
            <li> The jar even had my name and a date on it :)</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like that this was unscented, although I know that&#x27;s a plus for many people.</li>
            <li> Never again, Truly&#x27;s is much better.</li>
            <li> Words cannot explain the sheer joy this product has brought to my life!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safe to use</li>
            <li> besides that nothing extra, this stuff is perfect for the toughest athletes!</li>
            <li> Possibly the best deodorant ever!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and it works without harming me with toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, most of them contained baking soda</li>
            <li> Well boy am I glad that I purchased this product because it truly was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Magically, my underarms didn&#x27;t smell musky and I was amazed.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t burn more than the deo combo accident</li>
            <li> And more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many, many of the non-toxic fragrance-free deodorants out there, at every cost point.</li>
            <li> Most did nothing.</li>
            <li> I Have been looking for strong, safe healthy deodorant</li>
            <li> Easy to use and no horrible chemicals!!!!</li>
            <li> absolutely perfect, keeps you dry all day, no residue, no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve found and also love that its free of toxins and metals.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find a non toxic deodorant that works, for my daughter, THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> have the jar which is fine, but over time it seems like it&#x27;s solidified more (perhaps with air exposure), and thus compacted quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DeodoMom for about 3-4 weeks with amazing success.</li>
            <li> even more importantly I don&#x27;t have any concerns about toxic chemicals being leached into my bloodstream.</li>
            <li> I no longer use drugstore deodorant - in addition to being 100% natural, this is much more effective!</li>
            <li> This one is great for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Great product so far.</li>
            <li> DeodoMom Cream deodorant is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Lucky mofo!!!!!! But he always tells me I smell good not gross when I go the natural route.</li>
            <li> love knowing that I can be odor free without risking my health for the sake of hygiene.p</li>
            <li> I received the product on a special Sunday delivery, one day before estimated delivery!</li>
            <li> So happy to have something with good simple ingredients that really works!</li>
            <li> I thought this one would be an exception due to the excellent reviews, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Originally bought it for my 8 &amp; 11 year-old daughters because of the limited ingredients, but found that it worked great for me too!</li>
            <li> This product is very mild to the skin and lasts all day- even through the hottest of summer days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.  </li>
            <li> This is a great and much needed product I will purchase the product again, thank you for producing something useful</li>
            <li> Neither are easy to get out of your body once they are at toxic</li>
            <li> but it dries very quickly so its still easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to apply and lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;****Update****&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong and working through this tropical summer.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company directly for a sample of the roll on, they were very courteous and sent me a free sample as I wanted to try the roll on before reordering the cream.  </li>
            <li> When I first got this product, it was a nice creamy consistency, like lotion.</li>
            <li> I am now forever their loyal customer!  </li>
            <li> Good to note, I&#x27;ve used it daily for over six weeks to give it ample time before posting a review and have experienced no negative side effects or disappointments to date.  </li>
            <li> the substance seemed mild and safe, it had only 2 ingredients, it didn&#x27;t leave too many marks, and it had good reviews.</li>
            <li> no matter what, I break out into a huge rash and feel the pain for weeks.</li>
            <li> The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective natural deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li> : I had much better success with Deodomom over Lavilin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deoderant for a few weeks now and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The texture is a water light lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - have been using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> And, it has no harmful chemicals in it which is important to me as I was just treated for breast cancer and told by my doctors to avoid aluminum in deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation and it went on smoothly (hence the 2 stars)</li>
            <li> the people at DeodoMom sent me the cream for free.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast too, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It ain&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li> I have used both the cream and the roll-on, and both are gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t comfortable using those.</li>
            <li> I have also tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine (fragrance free), and feel that DeodoMom is far superior both in terms of effectiveness and ingredients.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried all the rest of so call natural deodorants and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin, did not irritate my underarms.</li>
            <li> Compared to another natural deodorant I tried, I wasn&#x27;t sure this was as effective at neutralizing odor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 5 days and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I liked my old antiperspirant because it smelled lovely and perfumey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> , I was so happy to find this deodorant two years ago while I was breastfeeding, and continued to use it while pregnant and breastfeeding with my second.</li>
            <li> Based off the products I have used in the past, this deodorant as worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> As long as I&#x27;m odor-free, I&#x27;m happy and my clothes don&#x27;t stink like pit smell anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much!  </li>
            <li> Its totally worth the money and will be stocking up soon!  </li>
            <li> Does not work for me, I was still sweating and did not feel fresh!</li>
            <li> If you try to use on armpits that arent clean it won&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and most have not worked as well as the non natural deodorant that I was using.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I continue to look for a perfect natural deodorant is because of the application of both.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You must have clean pits for it to work, so I put it on after I shower in the morning and again at night before I go to bed if I want to squeeze another day out of</li>
            <li> Deodomom leaves a clean feeling even when you sweat.</li>
            <li> There are so many great reviews,  I don&#x27;t want to be redundant, but suffice it to say that this stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless products to address my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; and this has been one of the most effective...</li>
            <li> It even works incredibly for more than 24 hours as I have slept in really late on my days off.  </li>
            <li> (yes, really), and odor free!</li>
            <li> This seemed so safe and works very well -just as well as all the clinical strength \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ingredient deodorants with aluminum in them.</li>
            <li> After a lifetime of wearing the big name anti-restaurants and deodorants, I have FINALLY found something I know is safe AND works incredibly well.</li>
            <li> This product works for a full 24 hrs after I apply it.</li>
            <li> This would probably be an effective deodorant for someone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t have a history of experiencing armpit lumps from deodorants.</li>
            <li> Good product,  lasted about 2 months of daily use &amp; I&#x27;m re-ordering.</li>
            <li> If you get used to applying it with your fingers instead of the standard roll-on or swipe on kind, it works really good at preventing perspiration naturally.  </li>
            <li> , it may be a good idea to mix a soothing mixture with a lower pH (possibly with lemon juice) to dab on your underarms each night for some time.</li>
            <li> Seems too good to be true, but it&#x27;s now my daily experience.</li>
            <li> I told them and they immediately sent me a new one for free :)</li>
            <li> I wish the roll on did work for me, since its easier to apply, but the cream is easy enough to apply on its own.</li>
            <li> Works great on my very sensitive skin and no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;After trying a number of natural formula products, I finally found something that is safe, effective, and truly works!</li>
            <li> I am an active person (run, cycle, triathlons) and this works great through all those activities.  </li>
            <li> I feel confident knowing it is safe enough to eat.</li>
            <li> so body odor can quickly become a problem almost any time of the year.</li>
            <li> The jar doesn&#x27;t seem to be good enough to keep the product fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now; I started using it before I was pregnant and am still using it while nursing.</li>
            <li> I found deodomom cream while pregnant and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about as mild on your skin as a product can be.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night, right after my shower, and I smell fresh throughout the day!</li>
            <li> More effective than any other aluminum-free crystal, spray, or stick</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t been very impressed with other natural deodorants that I have tried.</li>
            <li> We have only used it in winter, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the cream version, and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Given that it&#x27;s all in a simple and safe ingredient this has been a very big win for me.  </li>
            <li> I would really like to give this 5 stars as I have tried about 6 different deodorants and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I do sometimes sweat because it is a deodorant not an anti-perspirant, but I do not mind so long as I smell good.</li>
            <li> While baking soda might be a huge step above the aluminum based deodorants, it is a very powerful substance that can cause irritation and over-abrasion in many people.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my natural deodorant search is over!</li>
            <li> I feel like I sweat easily and have tried lots of different deodorants, even &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength ones, but this one still works so much better those.</li>
            <li> For now I certainly appreciate that it is fragrance free and WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> works okay for natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> This works better than any non-aluminum deodorant I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I avoid aluminum products because they make me sweat more, but that leaves a plethora of natural deodorants that do not work well on odor.</li>
            <li> So anyway, I gave it 3-star review because it did keep body odor away for a few days, which was slightly impressive for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used natural deodorants for years and have never found one I liked this much.</li>
            <li> On the fourth day, it seemed to not be effective anymore.  </li>
            <li> Had to write a review on this as i&#x27;m sure there are people out there struggling to find a natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far for me, the DeodoMom has been working a lot better than Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I also liked the Pit Powder about the same.</li>
            <li> Not unhappy, just curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely light creme and a tiny bit on finger tip smoothed over the under arm area</li>
            <li> It does make the underarm a bit white, but honestly, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li> I finally found a deordorant that is effective at neutralizing underarm odor.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried EVERY natural solution possible from powders to crystals to pastes and is is by far the BEST one.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a few weeks now and so far it has been great!  </li>
            <li> this wasn&#x27;t *too* much of a problem, but there were definitely times where I thought deodorant might be a good idea.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was pretty quick, and the product had to travel cross country, and the personalized lid label was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, convenient, lasts a long time, safe, and by all means effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried so many other natural deoderants, but none work anywere near as good as this!  </li>
            <li> 30someweeks was great sending me a replacement order for free when I complained about the first shipment leaking.</li>
            <li> I still sweat somewhat with this at times (which is to be expected) and on a really hot day I may stink a tiny bit, but this is one of the best that I can find.</li>
            <li> cream-- is soothing even right after shaving.</li>
            <li> (But you can&#x27;t just give up, right?).</li>
            <li> To be honest I do first apply some medicated powder for that extra protection when I work out.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this is, but I am ok with it since it&#x27;s such a good price and for those 3 days it does seem to be more effective than my other natural deodorant stand-by (which just masks the BO with a lovely scent).  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing and is very gentle on freshly shaven skin as well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try this if you&#x27;re looking for an aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> I live a very humid part of TX, so no matter what I use, I have to apply more than once a day.</li>
            <li> I have a very very sensitive skin and so does my spouse, this deoderant is effective and soft on your skin.</li>
            <li> A small amount works great</li>
            <li> Have been trying various natural deodorants for the last 4 years and wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results until I tried DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to other products, this stuff is amazing!!  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly in a cute package with a little label with my name written on it on top of the jar.</li>
            <li> I found lotion to be more effective than roll-on, although perhaps I lather the lotion on too thickly.  </li>
            <li> The Crystal, for example, was effective in the short term, but gave me really irritated skin after repeated use.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m still getting used to the feeling of sweating more, but really, this is the first natural deodorant I can see myself sticking with.  </li>
            <li> My order was received very fast and I began to use immediately.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very picky about the products he uses, and after trying MANY different natural deodorants he settled on this one as his favorite.</li>
            <li> After a long day, especially if it&#x27;s warm, I do feel a little stinky - but that happens with any deodorant.  </li>
            <li> And it comes in a cute little pot with your name on it, very boutiquish :)</li>
            <li> :) And, on the plus side, my shirts no longer get yellow stains since this stuff doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the roll-on and the jar and prefer the roll-on simply because it&#x27;s more convenient.  </li>
            <li> I think the cream actually works better.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> First I tried Himalayan salt.</li>
            <li> It has never burned and it really works!</li>
            <li> Love this simple, vegan deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works all day unless its a particularly hot day.</li>
            <li> I am a recent breast cancer survivor - 8 months cancer free!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> PS, my husband is so much happier now!</li>
            <li> She was hesitant at first about the &amp;#34;applying it with your fingers&amp;#34; aspect of it.  </li>
            <li> and she really loves it!  </li>
            <li> But I couldn&#x27;t give it 5-stars because I experienced a negative reaction to it.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t have to look anymore!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks, DeodoMom!</li>
            <li> With that said, when I first got the DeodoMom ( i have the jar)</li>
            <li> This product keeps me smelling fresh the whole day with just one application.  </li>
            <li> This product works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> so I have hot and humidity working against me and with body chemistry</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope the next one you try does.</li>
            <li> Plus, this is entirely aluminum free (unliked the salt deoderants, which contain aluminum!).  </li>
            <li> only thing he didn&#x27;t like was that after putting it on, his armpits felt more moist than with stick deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have every written.  </li>
            <li> I am willing to write a review because I feel everyone should know about this product and use it.  </li>
            <li> DeodoMom is safe, non-toxic and actually works!  </li>
            <li> I used to carry deodorant in my purse to reapply, but with deodomom just the one application first thing in the morning lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is the first deodorant that has worked for me in years and years.</li>
            <li> family first though.  </li>
            <li> I placed my first order on Amazon and in days it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands as well as homemade versions</li>
            <li> It is always possible I used more than the recommended amount, but I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands - all the big ones you&#x27;ve probably tried too</li>
            <li> It does not cause me any irritation and it stops me from sweating even during the hot days of summer.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t have to invest so much in magnesium hydroxide!</li>
            <li> More often than not, my underarms would become red and burn, or else</li>
            <li> You cannot get much safer than the ingredient in this product!</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered it, it was cracked and spilled all over the package.</li>
            <li> When I shower my under arms are free from any residue that my old deodorants would leave.</li>
            <li> It dried quickly when applied and never felt sticky, which was nice.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products - some of them are too greasy or not as effective.</li>
            <li> It even keeps me dry most of the time, and that is better than I can say for most anti-perpirants that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It generally works all day just fine.  </li>
            <li> A majority of effective hypoallergenic deodorants that are EFFECTIVE are so expensive, so with the $10 price tag and recommendations I found online</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that it is natural, only two ingredients, and effective.</li>
            <li> since it obviously works for many others and shipped really promptly</li>
            <li> I accept my wetness as a natural means of cooling off, but this product (along with daily underarm washing) is finally an effective defense against the smell.</li>
            <li> At least my son and husband had a good laugh at my expense.  </li>
            <li> Still, I was able to rub the paste on w/ the same results so it didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> truly appreciate how few ingredients this has and how it is touted as being safe and toxin-free, but another important question of course is how well does it deodorize?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived many years feeling self conscious about the ineffective natural deodorants I was committed to sticking with, and then I found deodomom.</li>
            <li> So i had previously gotten the roll on version which I absolutely love!</li>
            <li> and I saw a trend of positive feedback.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t all of the positive reviews...</li>
            <li> Saw positive reviews for this, so thought we&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> when the first jar they sent me got broken in the mail, they were really nice and sent me a free replacement right away.</li>
            <li> First of all, some background on me - I really want to use aluminum free/natural deodorants</li>
            <li> Like many people who are allergic to the aluminum found in almost all antiperspirant-deodorant products, I have been looking for an alternative for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am a dancer and when I first tried the deodorant, I was dancing for 6 hours straight in an intensive.</li>
            <li> Using a small amount dries the area and surprisingly works all day.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and it is hot!  </li>
            <li> After research (Home Pharmacy has a good Q&amp;amp;A) and finding that the crystal deodorant stone is actually a form of aluminum, as my primary provider naturopath warned me, I found this product, and it is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Blocking the natural process of release of fluid with aluminum is probably an unsafe methodology, and given the high rate of breast cancer</li>
            <li> I am impatient, so I just use a hairdryer on the cool setting.:)</li>
            <li> I really liked using this product for the first few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of alternative products, and nothing has beaten this in terms of efficacy, and certainly nothing comes close in terms of purity.</li>
            <li> after 2 to 3 hours sweating the protection is not longer there, I live in South Florida, this product isn&#x27;t strong enough for this type of climate, to be honest TOM&#x27;s natural deodorant offers more protection than this product for less money</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have used it for over a month and it really covers odors .The</li>
            <li> I trusted this one so much</li>
            <li> She was getting really embarrassed about her body odor.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this deodorant to work for me, but I guess it&#x27;s not compatible with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I really like that DeodoMom is unscented.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after my morning shower and am still stink free when I wake up next morning.</li>
            <li> i have struggled my whole life with stinkiness....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love that there are absolutely no harmful ingredients in this deodorant.</li>
            <li> this did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Deodomom.</li>
            <li> Dries up FAST -</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what happened</li>
            <li> Well not totally sweat free</li>
            <li> I was very optimistic</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant, and will absolutely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really have no problems with smelling or sweating when I use it.</li>
            <li> but it dries fast</li>
            <li> It does run out sort of fast</li>
            <li> but I may be using too much at a time.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it and it works for everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> DeodoMom is a deodorant not an antiperspirant and works no matter how much I sweat.  </li>
            <li> Being a professional woman, I need to stay fresh all day.</li>
            <li> This product works, even during the summer on very stressful days.</li>
            <li> so much I have ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to suffer that much</li>
            <li> and it really works for me, takes the odor and lets me sweat.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> Someone very close to me mentioned that I haven&#x27;t had any funk at all since using this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I found myself having to reapply it, even without much sweating.</li>
            <li> Really like that there are no chemicals/toxins</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like this product and am hooked.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t reek as much as I might if I hadn&#x27;t used this, but my pits still smell like pits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s alright for wearing after a shower and going straight to bed...</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 2 months now and have absolutely zero complaints.</li>
            <li> I tried many natural deodorants but they all left me stinky after a while.</li>
            <li> Glad I investigated something natural, I will never go back to OTC.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural deodorant with simple, safe ingredients that works for years.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t like scented deodorant - especially after it mixes with my own odor.  </li>
            <li> Another positive is that it takes very little of the product to be effective.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product, the only drawback is in the nature of the ingredient to dry up/dissolve in air.</li>
            <li> It has been fairly hot where I live and</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful deoderant alternative to the common ones that contain aluminum and other harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to deodorants and this is the first I have found that does not cause a reaction.  </li>
            <li> She seemed to really like it and found that it worked just as good if not better than the old stuff.</li>
            <li> Then it began to dry out very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It would be a much cheaper solution than the high end brand of mattifier I use now.</li>
            <li> Need very little to be effective.</li>
            <li> So I have been searching for an effective natural deodorant down through the years and only one of them seemed to work mildly</li>
            <li> This was one of three deodorants I purchased when I started to get an allergic reaction to regular deodorants/antiperspirants and looked for a more sensitive, natural product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants and this is the only one that&lt;br /&gt;has completely eliminated any body odor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking out a safe alternative to conventional deodorants.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve experienced is, strangely, a few pimples when I first made the switch; but once they went away, they didn&#x27;t come back.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast even though I live in Hawaii and guess what?</li>
            <li> and I typically stink by noon at the latest.</li>
            <li> Even my previous favorite, PitPowder, had to be reapplied a couple times throughout the day in order to keep stinky-ness at bay.</li>
            <li> It keeps you dry and odor free even after workouts.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it was offered in a glass jar though, less plastic in the world is better.</li>
            <li> :) My only issue is that it&#x27;s definitely not an anti-perspirant, which I knew going into it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more of this one, however I give it 4 stars for now since I think $10 is a bit much for a few ounces of any deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Even many of the healthy ones have ingredients that make me uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Like many people trying to avoid harmful ingredients, I&#x27;ve tried countless natural antiperspirants like The Crystal and Tom&#x27;s with limited success.</li>
            <li> But not wearing silk, or light blue button up shirts to work in the summer is a small price to pay for being healthy and not stinky.</li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone who has body odor issues or just wants to make the switch to something natural without any glycol!</li>
            <li> It has a very high pH and is not always suitable for sensitive skin, especially when using it in a way which keeps it in contact with the skin for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I think both women and men (men also high in breast cancer occurrences) should look to products like this that are not &#x27;anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> came to my attention and came highly reviewed, so thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this deodorant for each member of the family.</li>
            <li> highly recommend that anyone give this a try.</li>
            <li> I tested high for aluminum and off the charts with zirconium in a health test.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and am buying another one for my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if it would have worked in my teens and 20s when hormones are high.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but you do sweat using it in high heat.  </li>
            <li> milk of magnesia is high in pH</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my very sensitive skin, it has no odor and has left me completely b.o. free at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to stop me from sweating a little better.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely try this first!</li>
            <li> How did this little company figure out how to make something that so many are trying to do?</li>
            <li> This deodorant worked fairly well (&amp; I have a really tough time finding any deodorant that works for me).</li>
            <li> After trying a couple dozen of natural and conventional deodorants I haven&#x27;t found a better option than deodomom.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a natural, safe, deodorant that actually works.  </li>
            <li> i was really hoping this product would work because i&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant that truly does.</li>
            <li> The cream dries fast and can even be applied directly after shaving.</li>
            <li> I could also go 2 days without reapplying under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product totally warrants it.</li>
            <li> mom got the last laugh.</li>
            <li> I was using a mix of normal Secret/Degree deodorant/antiperspirant and alternating with scented Tom&#x27;s deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no negative reactions to it at all.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants with no success.</li>
            <li> Its doesn&#x27;t smell, and I can put it on once in the morning and go all day without reapplying on a normal day.</li>
            <li> I love that I did not get a rash and that it still worked without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone is different so this may not work for you, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> If you use too much it gets a bit of a white film, but just well... don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> jar only lasts me about 5 weeks but is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-This isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, but it&#x27;s a powerful deodorant and has worked for me immediately in removing musk even if I put it later on in the day and don&#x27;t wash up before applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS Wash/wipe this stuff off before applying normal deo bc</li>
            <li> And, honestly the paste was less likely to spill in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I do have a reapply if its an active day, but a majority of the time, a morning-time application worked just fine.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy good!  </li>
            <li> I live in Tucson</li>
            <li> thank you for  this new creation that is now in my life, tangi hayes</li>
            <li> (and we live in Phoenix).&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li> Strangely this product dries super fast and actually keeps your armpits dry and odor free.</li>
            <li> This stuff has definitely worked for me and I can&#x27;t say the same about the cheap store bought junk.</li>
            <li> I do miss the fresh scent of my old deodorant, but that was possibly one of the causes of the rash.</li>
            <li> (E Plus High C Natural roll-on deodorant by Aubrey Organics).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone looking for a natural deo alternative.</li>
            <li> I sweat easily, so I reapply it a couple of times in between showers if I have worked out or been very active.</li>
            <li> I wear it daily and live in FL where it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> love the cream version of their product and they now have a lifelong customer - MY SEARCH IS OVER!!!!</li>
            <li> It works better than any store bought organic deodorant I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> What makes DeodoMom unique from other products, is it&#x27;s effectiveness at neutralizing odor.</li>
            <li> I love that the product is made in small batches to ensurefreshness and was custom made when I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is made so simply, which is exactly what I look for in products, and for me it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Most of us had been trying the usual drug store deodorant products that did not contain aluminum, but had found they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have worn it to hot yoga several times</li>
            <li> This deodorant works better than a lot of other things (such as the salt crystal) and it didn&#x27;t make me feel like I smelled like a hippie.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t really natural!  </li>
            <li> I had problems with other aluminum free, all natural deodorants until I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> t bought the jar and it was full, within a week it was almost empty.  </li>
            <li> I guess my armpit got used to it and got mostly clean from the residuals of other deodorants.</li>
            <li> as it&#x27;s more eco conscious, so I&#x27;ll probably buy it in the other container next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light invisible and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for years for a product that did not smell like patchouli and kept me dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> Also, this is the first natural deodorant I have found that actually controls odor and perspiration -- even in the summer time.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that hasn&#x27;t caused a rash &amp; it actually works!</li>
            <li> noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically jog or do weights a few times a week, and spend time outdoors and walking on weekends, so it hasn&#x27;t gotten the full gamut of my own personal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream seemed kind of weird at first</li>
            <li> This is literally the first and only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever purchased that WORKED.</li>
            <li> and I am very surprised by how it has worked so far.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve struggled to find an effective, safe deodorant, I highly recommend trying it (even if you&#x27;re a dude and a little gun shy about the name).</li>
            <li> Its better than normal deodorants and no more Aluminum!</li>
            <li> The only slight drawback is that you have to wait a minute or so after applying before putting your top on.</li>
            <li> Somehow, I doubt it (I was stinky in the winter with the other natural brands and not at all with this, so that&#x27;s a lot of encouragement right there!)</li>
            <li> I love that there are minimal ingredients, and it is one of the only natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used that not only doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin, but also works.  </li>
            <li> After trying several natural deodorants, I was about to give up hope of discovering something that worked for me as well as aluminum products, but this little jar of magic truly does.  </li>
            <li> I have also been on the search for what feels like my whole life to find a natural deo that actually works.</li>
            <li> I have bought every natural deodorant under the sun trying to find one that works.</li>
            <li> It actually works very well.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what happens with a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural deodorant that works for years.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this works.</li>
            <li> During the time I was going through 11 months of treatment, I was looking for an all natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying natural deodorants for about 4-5 years with no luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not concerned about sweating, because that is a natural process.  </li>
            <li> Also, I know putting lotion deodorant on seems strange at first, but I was putting lotion under my arms anyway</li>
            <li> but that was FAR from the case for me as man.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> version so far.</li>
            <li> It has no smell yet takes care of any body odors that would naturally occur.</li>
            <li> I had been using another natural, non-aluminum cream deodorant for about a year when I decided to try DeodoMom.  </li>
            <li> Since switching to deodomom, the rash has completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to switch to all natural products as my fiancé</li>
            <li> Always let it try completely before putting on clothing.</li>
            <li> I was really so surprised.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this deodorant</li>
            <li> Even with the non natural deodorant, I still had some issues with sweating and stinking.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used natural deodorant options before, you should know ahead of time that they will not prevent you from sweating, but they do minimize or eliminate odor from sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried zillions of natural deodorants, and it seems to be just trial and error to determine what works well with your body chemistry.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, any natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t work for you just doesn&#x27;t work for *</li>
            <li> So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old son who has been wearing deodorant since he was 4.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural to replace Degree for myself and my son.</li>
            <li> I recommend this deodorant to anyone that is looking to find a natural brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Since then I have tried all of the natural brands sold in health food stores (Tom&#x27;s, Kiss</li>
            <li> I switched to the Soapwalla brand deodorant cream, which is all natural and comes in a jar.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market that had natural claims and nothing worked at all.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and asked if I would compromise the effectiveness of their product by adding some vanilla essential oil diluted with jojoba and they gave me immediate feedback and suggestions on how much to add</li>
            <li> I have never found ANY natural products that worked as well as Deodomom deodorant.  </li>
            <li> its natural</li>
            <li> no reactions thus far.</li>
            <li> Having gone through this countless times before, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li> What surprised me was that despite not having used this product a lot, when I opened it one day, it appeared to be disintegrating.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts and itiching  </li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural deodorant and found this.</li>
            <li> DeodoMom really surprised me.</li>
            <li> but I developed a sensitivity to one of the ingredients and had to quit using it.  </li>
            <li> so I would still recommend trying it if you&#x27;re looking for a natural, scentless deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every natural deodorant I could - homemade, store bought - nothing worked.</li>
            <li> However, some of the crystal types irritated my sensitive skin, so I tried this one.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything natural when it comes to deodorant and have found nothing that compares to DeodoMom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> sure on longevity of the jar, as it is fairly small, but I&#x27;m guessing it should last me at least 2 months, and I plan to buy more</li>
            <li> One more tip, if it starts it starts to dry out in the container, just add a touch of water to it and maybe mix slightly.</li>
            <li> I just got tired of the calamine lotion-like scent of E Plus High C and wondered if there was something better out there.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to twist the lid on tight bc it will dry up faster if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I also bought the roll-on and had the same exact results (massive stank).</li>
            <li> additionally peri-menopause has left me more sweaty than usual, so the cream has passed the test with me.  </li>
            <li> so I usually have to put some olive oil on my underarms at night and a dab of perfume oils in the day for that extra girly magic,</li>
            <li> The roll-on version of the product travels better, but takes a little longer to dry after applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled to find a deodorant that really cuts down on odor while not irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to all the potential stinky girls (and guys) refusing to lift their arms at work!</li>
            <li> After years of trying various natural deodorant I have finally found one that really works.  </li>
            <li> Not only because of the toxic chemicals, but because after a month or two, they seem to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants claim to allow your body to perspire normally, and focus on covering up any odor.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little white residue where the product went on, but it comes off in an instant with a little water or a slightly damp cloth, so it&#x27;s great for days where one is wearing black or a tank top.  </li>
            <li> This one actually works, and I live in AZ where its already over 100 degrees.</li>
            <li> read the ingredient list of your other deodorants, and you might not feel comfortable rubbing that into your skin every single day.</li>
            <li> It works very well and kept me dry.  </li>
            <li> , I keep my jar in a ziploc bag and suck out the air before sealing so it doesn&#x27;t dry out as fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very concerned about the things in commercial deodorant, such as aluminum that can absorb through your skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many brands of deodorants (Degree, Tom&#x27;s, Secret, Speed Stick, Arm and Hammer, Axe, old spice) and</li>
            <li> I went on the search for all natural deodorant recipes and all natural commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li> The cream effectively masks odor but started to give me a rash because it still contains skin irritating ingredients such as lavender, tea tree, and peppermint.</li>
            <li> The application is a little different, but I got used to it and feel it really does stand up to some hot sweaty days.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found a deodorant with natural ingredients, no harsh chemicals, and just a few ingredients THAT WORKS!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants and this is the winner!</li>
            <li> and I think I finally found my natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> I finally found a natural deodorant that works!  </li>
            <li> This actually worked better than regular deodorants I had in the past, and I sweat a LOT bro.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m now on week 3 and most of the time not only do I smell nothing at all from a long day at work or even after working out, I am somehow sweating significantly less than with my former anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slowly been moving to more natural products, and other all natural deoderants were not working.</li>
            <li> To me it is worth that little trade off for actually having a natural product that works.</li>
            <li> It is odorless, it does not stain your clothes, and it greatly reduces the bad odor caused by sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oana</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this product and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh or irritating ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> What I am concerned about is body odor, and this is the only natural deodorant product that has worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried various deodorants since deciding to find a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> After years of \\&quot;trying out\\&quot; organic and natural deodorant products, I have finally found one that works!</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that works, and it works damn well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous all natural deodorants</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this only for 5 days, but so far I am hooked.</li>
            <li> I had resigned to using old spice for the last 4 years</li>
            <li> It can last for 1 to 2 days between showers, and it hasn&#x27;t irritated anyone&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant I have tried that keeps my underarms from being smelly and does so for over 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> Finding an all natural deodorant that actually works AND does not give me an allergic reaction is my &amp;#34;white whale&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is a soft, white cream.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural deodorant without all the chemicals in the regular ones.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a natural deodorant that actually worked for me, but this one wasn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> I struggle with a magnesium deficiency that causes a number of issues from anxiety, restless leg syndrome, headaches - and apparently body odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few months, and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using antiperspirants with so many chemicals and would on occasions cause severe skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure those other deodorants made me smell worse (especially the baking soda brand).</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll figure out the right amount for you after a few days.</li>
            <li> Its very simple and totally worth the little effort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the cream so far, and plan on trying the roll on next.</li>
            <li> I was about to give up hope and go back to the commercial un natural brands, but I came across DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> Most of them ether didn&#x27;t work much or actually made me smell worse.</li>
            <li> Initial packaging was poor but replacement package was much better.</li>
            <li> No rash, though at first it tingled a little when I applied it.</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s chemistry is different, but for us it works like no other we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am very antichemical and refuse to expose my body to your average chemical laden deodorant.  </li>
            <li> i went ALL DAY ( a normal day around the house) with absolutely NO BO.  </li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ll say that I do sweat and sometimes heavily even when sitting idle at my desk for periods of time.  </li>
            <li> In my quest to find a deodorant without aluminum, I have tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands that I&#x27;ve found both at major grocery chains and smaller health food stores.</li>
            <li> Im a military blue collar worker who normally has to shower 3 times a day to control the stench.</li>
            <li> I have been going CRAZY trying to find something that works, wasting a lot of time and money, not to mention, sacrificing some relationships, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> The quantity was much less than I remembered being left - I knew I had not used that much -</li>
            <li> It only seems to fail if I have had an especially long and sweaty day, but most normal days</li>
            <li> I got this one just to save the extra few bucks after my roll on was all gone thinking it would work exactly the same just different packaging.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant, but it really only lasts a little over a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely natural and can be fixed by adding a little water and then mixing well.&lt;br /&gt;-Because</li>
            <li> Applying with my fingers was a little strange at first, but soon became no big deal, though I will try the roll on next for comparison.  </li>
            <li> I was using the crystal deodorant, with good results, until the People&#x27;s Pharmacy said it is made of alum, which is aluminum, and still could possibly be bad for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about a roll on (too wet), a cream, or powder (too messy).</li>
            <li> Good product, but dried out and became rather useless within weeks.</li>
            <li> The only down sides is that it&#x27;s wet at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gotten so desperate I had made my own (with decent results) but decent is not good enough for me!</li>
            <li> All the deodorants / antiperspirants containing aluminum __________, or other alternatives just don’t work well on me, even when they do they make my body odor smell worse, even the fragrance free ones (interestingly the smell is worse with the products that contain fragrance!).&lt;br /&gt;Finally</li>
            <li> I have tried a TON of different natural deodorants and none, other than this, have actually worked.</li>
            <li> I am very active and exercise usually once a day, and this product keeps me odor free.</li>
            <li> tried numerous other natural deodorants and they either were stinky or they made my armpits sore.</li>
            <li> I have used many other deodorants and went behind every advertised product.</li>
            <li> is I can apply it after shaving with no irritation, which sets it apart from every other natural deodorant and antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the other natural deodorants would wear off by midday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can sweat naturally through it, but absolutely no smell!</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, and I actually wash my tops less frequently (what?!).</li>
            <li> With only 2 ingredients I was doubtful, but it is remarkable.</li>
            <li> The only difference is that you have to dab on the cream with your finger and only use a little at a time during application as to not waste or leave a white residue.  </li>
            <li> And yes sometimes the jar dries out a little (but really it&#x27;s not too hard to mix in a bit more water and let it sit overnight.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and &#x27;conventional&#x27; aluminum-containing antiperspirants seem to clog my lymph nodes, which in turn, leads to nickle-size pus-filled lumps under my armpits.</li>
            <li> I only have to apply once in the morning and it works all day long, with not even a hint of irritation after months of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange because I saw another user with this same experience.</li>
            <li> just tested it to see how long it would actually work for.</li>
            <li> I have occasionally smelled an odor after a long day, but it is far less than what it would be without this deodorant.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product was that it dried up into a thick paste quickly even though I kept it closed very tightly in a cool room.</li>
            <li> When I decided to start buying cruelty free deodorant, I was very concerned my husband might leave me because I smelled so bad.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, it does need some drying time but the cream only takes about a minute or two to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented which is a big deal to me and it keeps me dry, you don&#x27;t get that out of any &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve exhausted the natural aisle at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> I think it works better than secret brand, which I kept on hand for events  that I was not comfortable with the idea of sweating through, and I do sweat, a lot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I need only a little bit (a half pea sized amount) per underarm each morning and it lasts me through the day- too much</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend though as it dies completely and does not typically leave behind any residue on clothes!</li>
            <li> The product is like a thin cream (but entirely water based) and a small dab spreads easily, so the jar lasts me several months.  </li>
            <li> For the rest of my life I use the natural deodorants and just know I&#x27;m gonna have a little BO at some point in the day.  </li>
            <li> The vast majority didn&#x27;t work at all or didn&#x27;t last, and the couple that did inevitably irritated my skin after a few weeks or months.</li>
            <li> This will be my go to deodorant as long as they make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But that is a minor thing.</li>
            <li> It made me produce a strange indescribable smell from my armpits.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t produce any strange smells like Lavilin did.</li>
            <li> I have learned to keep the jar as tightly closed as possible.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Because dealing with odor issues has been a life long struggle.</li>
            <li> It holds up to long and sweaty days and covers any smell.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for so long</li>
            <li> This deodorant works, but as long as those with aluminum in them.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t talk about how well it works long term, but here&#x27;s my experience.</li>
            <li> This could be a lemon juice mixture diluted with water, rosewater, or aloe vera which you dab on and keep for a long time, a honey+lemon juice mixture which you apply in the shower and wash off, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re tired of being stinky but don&#x27;t want to resort to chemicals to deal with the issue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have a single stink after a long day of chasing three boys around.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product which truly works and causes absolutely no skin irritation!  </li>
            <li> With other deodorants I would get a red rash with skin peeling...</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s and other similar deodorants just made me armpits an immediate irritated mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> NOTHING worked, the dreaded antiperspirant with aluminum, the crystal, toms, lavilin, and various other naturals.</li>
            <li> Finally my search has ended...and I am extremely happy/satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I read 1 other review stating the same thing happened to them.</li>
            <li> Due to medical problems I sweat alot.  </li>
            <li> deodorant keeps me dry</li>
            <li> Keep the lid on it or it will dry out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want my shaving cream to dry them out.</li>
            <li> Just pour some in a cup, and let it dry for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t dry out</li>
            <li> I stay dry all day and guess what...</li>
            <li> The product keeps me dry without irritation and neutralizes any hint of odor.</li>
            <li> dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry skin issues too</li>
            <li> no waiting for it to dry like roll-ons.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to be honest in saying I did notice the deodorant once applied, on at least a couple of occasions.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after she constantly broke out in rashes from conventional deodorant.</li>
            <li> The only ingredients in plain milk of magnesia are magnesium hydroxide and water, the same ingredients in DeodoMom.  </li>
            <li> I have tried various products but have had no success.  </li>
            <li> I was already used to the slightly sweaty feeling that comes with wearing a deodorant without an antiperspirant, and I actually found that DeodoMom keeps me fairly dry</li>
            <li> In the past I have just gone back to commercial deodorant just out of desperation for something that I know works.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> In the last couple years it&#x27;s been mandatory for health reasons for me to switch to less toxic products.</li>
            <li> Since you only need a small amount, I think the jar will last for some time.</li>
            <li> Every time I open it it seems like there is less product inside.</li>
            <li> Maybe the concentration is a little different, but I end up smelling by the end of the day with the roll on.  </li>
            <li> but I put a little bit of distilled water in it to put the moisture back into the product and</li>
            <li> Also, tou need so little of it that this jar will last a looong time.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be reordering when it comes time to do so, but that won&#x27;t be for awhile because you need to use so little that I can see this jar lasing the rest of the year.  </li>
            <li> I anticipate this little jar should last for months.  </li>
            <li> and it may leave a little bit of white residue on your underarms.</li>
            <li> Finally a company who deserves my hard earned money in exchange for goods that actually do what they promise!</li>
            <li> Ex college-athlete who previously used Old Spice and a few other anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly due to the limited ingredients and lack of fragrance.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about it is that it isn&#x27;t actually an antiperspirant, so you will still sweat.</li>
            <li> I have tried 5 different brands that all worked for a few weeks, then I started to smell.</li>
            <li> It is liquid has absolutely no consistency</li>
            <li> You will feel wet if you sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25 y.o female and inherited my dad&#x27;s heavy sweating genes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune trying what seems like all of them and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using commercial deodorant and sometimes the extra-dry (read: heavy aluminum content) deodorant because I don&#x27;t want the stink in my clothes (doesn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just closed liquid.</li>
            <li> I quit using harsh deodorants within the last year, they didn&#x27;t help with body odor anyway!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is described as drying quickly to an imperceptible white haze, leaving no residue or stain on clothing.</li>
            <li> and it had only been a few months (</li>
            <li> Something that works really well, contains no fragrance or unnecessary additives, doesn’t leave a residue, and, even when I do sweat</li>
            <li> It still worked but was harder to apply.</li>
            <li> In addition, you want to be careful with your mixture not being too</li>
            <li> After trying many natural and unnatural deodorants claiming to give comfort to an over active sweat/odor condition...all of which either didn&#x27;t&#x27; work or caused such awful skin reactions, I hesitantly ordered DeodoMom from 30SomeWeeks on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Ohhh thank you Universe for allowing me to stumble upon this little life changing tub of goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needing a toxin-free deodorant due to health issues, I found this product based on its ingredients and pricing.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product without pesticides, metals, alcohol, GMOs, and other parabens.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but willing to try.  </li>
            <li> I probably will not purchase again due to the cost.</li>
            <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, as it seemed to in other people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this at first, but it has proven to me that it works.  </li>
            <li> Holds up well except in extreme heat like 95 degree days but in those conditions what does.  </li>
            <li> stopped using my Dove deodorant (with aluminum, parabens, and a host of other unnatural things) as soon as I placed my order for DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> The jar will leak if packed with other toiletries, so I keep it in a separate ziplock bag.  </li>
            <li> You really only need to apply a small amount.</li>
            <li> Also, during the first week of using it my pits had a really weird smell to them...</li>
            <li> It seems that it works wonders for other people</li>
            <li> So I ordered this with extreme skepticism.</li>
            <li> You can usually get a generic 12 ounce bottle of MoM for less than $2.00.</li>
            <li> The notorious underarm stains that result from conventional anti-perspirants are gone from my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other natural odor solutions (Soapwalla) that left me with painful red rashes under my arm pits after two weeks of use and others not even eliminating odor (Tom&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> Also a plus, doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothing so I can wear it with dark tank tops.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cream started drying up inside the jar.</li>
            <li> yet to use it through the summer months, but I have a feeling it will still work well or at least well enough!</li>
            <li> I bought these since it says &amp;#34;hypoallergenic,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve had issues with regular deodorants lately.</li>
            <li> I ordered bulk (8.82oz) from Amazon and mixed with water to the consistency of thick hand lotion.</li>
            <li> If it starts to get a little dry, just add a few drops of water and stir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still waiting for the lump to completely go down</li>
            <li> (it has gone down some).</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that it&#x27;s messy to apply because it&#x27;s the texture of lotion.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stop me from sweating, but I sweat less</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; brands typically haven&#x27;t done the trick against smell.</li>
            <li> Also, one slight downside is the packaging.  </li>
            <li> It is with slight apprehension that I ordered this after stumbling across it on a blog.  </li>
            <li> -)&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I am not pregnant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the crystal deodorant, among others typically found at health food stores.</li>
            <li> My underarms have been much less irritated since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to hold my arms down tight when someone at work is looking over my shoulder at my computer monitor</li>
            <li> just down right unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I do have some BO after exercise and toward the end of the day, but my shirts don&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as with Tom&#x27;s (mix of sickly sweet scent from the deodorant + BO).</li>
            <li> My underarms must have been so clogged up with the bad stuff; it took a full three days for my armpits to sweat again while I was waiting for it to come in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> one year if kept at room temperature with the lid secured tightly.</li>
            <li> #34;a little dab a do ya&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A little leaked out during shipping.</li>
            <li> I have the cream one, I just dab a little on</li>
            <li> Have been using for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I like to apply a little arrowroot powder on my armpits, as I think that helps with delaying sweating a bit.&lt;br /&gt;-Some</li>
            <li> people have reported the mixture drying up a bit, but mixing a little water in helps in loosening, \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot;, and softening the mixture without it losing its potency.</li>
            <li> , it got a little messy.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, even when I shave my underarms a few times per week.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20-something, petite, thin, female with no health issues</li>
            <li> I also had to apply it everyday or every-other-day for it to work.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s almost like it dried up no matter</li>
            <li> I have wasted lot of $$$$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy sweater also.</li>
            <li> After it dried out the effectiveness wasn&#x27;t there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted tons of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the last four days and have not experienced any burn whatsoever, nor has it lost its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Prior to this I was using a homemade deodorant from a vendor on Etsy, but I grew tired of the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; scent and</li>
            <li> thinly but cover the entire surface area.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few days in a row</li>
            <li> After leaving it near the air vent for one night it hardened and became a weird, dryer consistency.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I felt the need to carry this deodorant with me because it usually wouldn&#x27;t last me through the day, something I never experienced with my old Dove antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> actually gave up my search for awhile and resigned myself to Secret Unscented, which wasn&#x27;t irritating, but had a long list of chemicals I was not a fan of.</li>
            <li> I still sweat when working out, but even then, there is never a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> I regret that, however, as I&#x27;ve lately been made aware of the various dangerous and unnecessary ingredients in common and well-known deodorants/antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Everything worked for few hours, not more than that.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how I stumbled onto this product and again I was very skeptical of it doing much for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> A few made some small difference but they irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but I have had a hard time finding an all natural deodorant that was.</li>
            <li> I always kept it sealed very tightly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for alternatives to anti-perspirants (no more aluminum), but all seemed to really just trade one evil for another and have some level of hidden and potentially harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li> lotion is a thick lotion and  leaves a little residue</li>
            <li> I feel like I sweat less, and the smell is much less irritating.</li>
            <li> I initially tried deodomom due to the fact that my typical hypoallergenic deodorant started causing a painful underarm rash.  </li>
            <li> I usually need to use clinical strength deodorant.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it before I brush my teeth</li>
            <li> Just get a small container with a lid and mix till you like it.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful I did because both actually work just as well as my Secret Unscented!</li>
            <li> find that I usually need to reapply once (maybe twice on a toasty day).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After you get out of the shower you appky a small amount.</li>
            <li> I am usually in a rush to get to work, and after applying DeodoMom to my underarms with my fingers, I had to wash my hands again - which was one additional minute in my morning ritual.</li>
            <li> No more carrying deodorant in my purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure what I think of this product.</li>
            <li> takes a bit getting used to the application, but small price to pay.</li>
            <li> but no more after that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had terrible trouble finding a deodorant/antiperspirant that I am not allergic to and which applies easily.  </li>
            <li> Epic fail!</li>
            <li> However, the container is annoying, &amp; mine dried up extremely fast.</li>
            <li> so it is hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, and I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t find one that works.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained they</li>
            <li> After years of being frustrated and having to reapply frequently, I took a chance on this stuff.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been trying to select bath, body, and household products with fewer, and safer, ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have tried every natural deodorant you can buy and every one made me break out in a painful rash.</li>
            <li> My complaint is the price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing, and something that might make her not buy it again, was it dried out.</li>
            <li> For at least 15 years I have been struggling with my odor issues.</li>
            <li> I have been desperate to find a non-toxic alternative to commercial deodorant and I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> the product&#x27;s description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency in the jar was similar to a cold cream, and upon application, felt like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No mess...it manages to control odor for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a small lady, but man does bacteria grow in my pits!</li>
            <li> I mean a lot and never once have I felt compelled to write a review.</li>
            <li> I mean, even after 24 hours nothing...</li>
            <li> When I am sweaty and reapply/use &#x27;regular&#x27; deodorant, it leaves a weird odor on my clothes, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> You get a very small quantity for the price.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I stink.</li>
            <li> Though the PitPowder could actually absorb and reverse nasty odors whereas I find this product works only if applied after bathing.</li>
            <li> i was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> Not good options.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately because of the texture I just wasted money.</li>
            <li> Inexplicably, after a month of use this turned rock hard despite being kept tightly shut in my 70 degree bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> I tend to have very delicate underarms and have been searching for a deoderant that will not irritate them.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit obsessed lately with the toxic chemicals that are in all of our household products, and I check all ingredients obsessively on the EWG website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this made my armpits smell exponentially worse.  </li>
            <li> So frustrating.</li>
            <li> This just did not work for me, although I like the idea behind it.</li>
            <li> Then I switched to Tom&#x27;s to avoid aluminum and it made sweating and smelling way worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect, it does leave some whiteness if you apply as thickly as I do,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t claim to know the science behind it.</li>
            <li> Im very disappointed as I read the reviews and had high expectations.</li>
            <li> I think the tendency of milk of magnesia (what this deodorant is made of) is to dry up, so don&#x27;t be afraid if you see it drying!</li>
            <li> Its virtually impossible to mess up.</li>
            <li> Either they give me a horrific rash (baking soda ones) or they don&#x27;t work at all (&amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; ones), or they make me smell even WORSE than if I don&#x27;t use anything at all (Lush deodorants).  </li>
            <li> but everything from lush to Toms broke me out in a horrible rash!</li>
            <li> and I smell bad by half way through the day!</li>
            <li> I just opened the jar now, and the product is a bit hard, and has a very faint odor that reminds me a bit of chlorine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But eventually, I started to notice a small painful lump developing in my armpit</li>
            <li> Try this product, you won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> and definitely you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get any rash or anything weird.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sad to say I am too stinky for this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Weird, makes me wonder if there is a secret ingredient that scientists don&#x27;t know about in this stuff!</li>
            <li> I purchased the roll on and sadly it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post an update it if fails me then.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally I came across this product and was skeptical-</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m serious, it was bad... so embarrassing).</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I am not pregnant, I just wanted to use something that didn&#x27;t contain nasty chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to deodorant and I&#x27;m desperate for something I could use.</li>
            <li> Until I started flapping my arms in the air like a chicken spreading the stink...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t smell horrible, but I did notice some odor compared to the past.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> We have not had a whisper of a bad scent</li>
            <li> I would always have a bad odor.  </li>
            <li> All I smelled was bad BO while using it.</li>
            <li> Sweat isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing since it can an antiperspirant can clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband is even shocked.</li>
            <li> this gave me a painful rash :(.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Hate the scent of deodorants that I buy in store, even the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> People with bad odor are avoided by everyone, worst of all the ladies!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible deodarant.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> all I ever got was deodorant that worked for an hour ir horrible underarm rashes.</li>
            <li> I would not recomend this even to my worst enemy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works okay for natural deodorant. It helps with wetness , but still have some breakthrough odor. I usually need to use clinical strength deodorant. This works better than any non-aluminum deodorant I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I was so, so, so hopeful about this after reading the reviews. I&#x27;m allergic to deodorant and I&#x27;m desperate for something I could use. This product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I did a bunch of searching and experimenting with non-aluminum deodorants and was pretty happy when I found this product.  I&#x27;ve tried both the roll on and the cream.  The cream works better for me.  Maybe the concentration is a little different, but I end up smelling by the end of the day with the roll on.  I wish the roll on did work for me, since its easier to apply, but the cream is easy enough to apply on its own.</li>
            <li> I have bought every natural deodorant under the sun trying to find one that works. Most of them ether didn&#x27;t work much or actually made me smell worse. I am happy to say that I have ended my hunt because this stuff REALLY works. I have even went camping for 4 days with no shower and used DeodoMom every day and I didn&#x27;t stink. I love it and will be getting it again.</li>
            <li> In my quest to find a deodorant without aluminum, I have tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands that I&#x27;ve found both at major grocery chains and smaller health food stores. I have tried 5 different brands that all worked for a few weeks, then I started to smell. And I do not smell good... haha. I&#x27;m pretty sure those other deodorants made me smell worse (especially the baking soda brand). I did a lot of research that brought me to Deodomom. This stuff is AMAZING!! I no longer have to hold my arms down tight when someone at work is looking over my shoulder at my computer monitor (I&#x27;m serious, it was bad... so embarrassing). I even work out and I DO NOT SMELL at all after. My husband is even shocked. :) My only issue is that it&#x27;s definitely not an anti-perspirant, which I knew going into it. So, I do sweat a lot using this when it&#x27;s warm, and I have to pick and choose what kinds of shirts I can wear. But not wearing silk, or light blue button up shirts to work in the summer is a small price to pay for being healthy and not stinky. :) And, on the plus side, my shirts no longer get yellow stains since this stuff doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum. I DEFINITELY recommend this product!!!!!  I&#x27;ve tried both the roll-on and the jar and prefer the roll-on simply because it&#x27;s more convenient.  Both work great!</li>
            <li> Dont work for my stinky butt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, and I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t find one that works. I found DeodoMom by searching the internet for reviews and I saw a trend of positive feedback. I ordered some for myself and a couple of family members to try out. It actually works very well. I prefer the cream to the roll on. I think the cream actually works better. It&#x27;s kind of nice that it is unscented. Sometimes I add a touch of essential oil of my choice. I will definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> It is odorless, it does not stain your clothes, and it greatly reduces the bad odor caused by sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oana</li>
            <li> This product really works! I have tried MANY deodorants without aluminum to decrease my risk of breast cancer and Alzheimer disease (just in case). Recently, I discovered I am allergic to fragrance. I searched for a deodorant with no aluminum and no fragrance. First I tried Himalayan salt. Epic fail! It BURNED!!! Then I found this and I am NEVER using anything else again!&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant keeps me dry (yes, really), and odor free! I highly recommend you try it!!! I have it in the jar in the cream-type formula. I use it everyday, even when I shave my underarms a few times per week. It has never burned and it really works!</li>
            <li> After research (Home Pharmacy has a good Q&amp;amp;A) and finding that the crystal deodorant stone is actually a form of aluminum, as my primary provider naturopath warned me, I found this product, and it is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Blocking the natural process of release of fluid with aluminum is probably an unsafe methodology, and given the high rate of breast cancer, I think both women and men (men also high in breast cancer occurrences) should look to products like this that are not &#x27;anti-perspirants.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;After trying a number of natural formula products, I finally found something that is safe, effective, and truly works!</li>
            <li> Needing a toxin-free deodorant due to health issues, I found this product based on its ingredients and pricing. A majority of effective hypoallergenic deodorants that are EFFECTIVE are so expensive, so with the $10 price tag and recommendations I found online, I gave this product a try. Based off the products I have used in the past, this deodorant as worked the best for me. I do have a reapply if its an active day, but a majority of the time, a morning-time application worked just fine. It &amp;#34;deodorized&amp;#34; but don&#x27;t count on it as an antiperspirant as well in some cases. I would buy again, but as the stick product, not the cream you have to apply with your hands, it got a little messy. All in all, based on the price and its effectiveness, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works perfect and is all natural!!  It smells great too.  You can tell as soon as you put it on that it&#x27;s a high quality product.  I will definitely be buying again when I run out</li>
            <li> Was great for about 5 days. Then it hardened into a chalky substance that couldn&#x27;t be used. I kept it under my sink at room temperature.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love deodo mom. It works better than any store bought organic deodorant I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I wear it daily and live in FL where it&#x27;s hot and I never smell. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Love this simple, vegan deodorant. Some reviewers have complained they they still sweat... that&#x27;s what happens with a natural deodorant. What makes DeodoMom unique from other products, is it&#x27;s effectiveness at neutralizing odor. Even though you may sweat, you won&#x27;t smell!</li>
            <li> I have had terrible trouble finding a deodorant/antiperspirant that I am not allergic to and which applies easily.  This is a really excellent product, the best I have ever used.  Well done! whoever invented this.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural deodorant that works for years.  I am very sensitive to deodorants and this is the first I have found that does not cause a reaction.  Also, this is the first natural deodorant I have found that actually controls odor and perspiration -- even in the summer time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants and this is the winner! I have purchased it 5 times now. It is by far the purest in ingredients AND works the best! I Love knowing that my baby is not ingesting aluminum from antiperspirants as I breastfeed. I feel confident knowing it is safe enough to eat.</li>
            <li> I avoid aluminum products because they make me sweat more, but that leaves a plethora of natural deodorants that do not work well on odor. After years of being frustrated and having to reapply frequently, I took a chance on this stuff. It is great! Works all day unless its a particularly hot day. No residue, no fragrance, it&#x27;s just magic! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> After trying many natural and unnatural deodorants claiming to give comfort to an over active sweat/odor condition...all of which either didn&#x27;t&#x27; work or caused such awful skin reactions, I hesitantly ordered DeodoMom from 30SomeWeeks on Amazon. May I share that it was the best Amazon purchase I&#x27;ve ever made!! Gone are the days of constant worry and embarrassment over underarm odor. This product is very mild to the skin and lasts all day- even through the hottest of summer days. If you are in search of personal underarm odor relief- give DeodoMom a try...You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think my search for the best aluminum-free deodorant is finally over.  More effective than any other aluminum-free crystal, spray, or stick I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve exhausted the natural aisle at Whole Foods.  I found lotion to be more effective than roll-on, although perhaps I lather the lotion on too thickly.  The only issue I&#x27;ve experienced is, strangely, a few pimples when I first made the switch; but once they went away, they didn&#x27;t come back.  I&#x27;ll stick with this over totally ineffective sprays any day.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been trying to select bath, body, and household products with fewer, and safer, ingredients. This deodorant caught my attention because it contains only 2 ingredients. Reading the great reviews, I thought it was worth a try. After having used it for several weeks, I can say myself that it does the job for me!  It works all day and does not irritate. I have also tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine (fragrance free), and feel that DeodoMom is far superior both in terms of effectiveness and ingredients. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all!! Used it when I wore a sleeveless dress to a wedding. BIG mistake! I was sweaty AND smelly!! Store bought milk of magnesia works much better! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible deodarant. It is liquid has absolutely no consistency so it is hard to put on. I was sweating within minutes of applying. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this works. I was expecting a glass jar though as it&#x27;s more eco conscious, so I&#x27;ll probably buy it in the other container next time. It only seems to fail if I have had an especially long and sweaty day, but most normal days it does what it says it will!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I tried many natural deodorants but they all left me stinky after a while. Not this product. I have used it for over a month and it really covers odors .The lotion is a thick lotion and  leaves a little residue but it does not bother me.Will try the roll on next.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product which truly works and causes absolutely no skin irritation!  I am allergic to fragrance and also want to avoid anti-perspirants with aluminum.  Even the deodorants with essential oils caused rashes under my arms.  This product WORKS and it has not caused any irritation.  Wish I would have found this two years ago - it would have saved me time, money and irritation!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I am a recent breast cancer survivor - 8 months cancer free!  During the time I was going through 11 months of treatment, I was looking for an all natural deodorant.  Several recommendations by healthcare providers of over the counter products did not meet my needs.  I wanted a product without pesticides, metals, alcohol, GMOs, and other parabens. After researching what I needed on the internet, DeodoMom was the only product I found that meets my needs! The product is odorless, non-greasy and long-lasting!  If used according the instructions, it does not damage your clothes - just &amp;#34;a little dab a do ya&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have tried a TON of different natural deodorants and none, other than this, have actually worked. I trusted this one so much I used it during my summer, outdoor wedding. Great product! Easy to use and no horrible chemicals!!!!</li>
            <li> So, I tried the alternative&#x3D; non scented, store brand milk of magnesia. This did not work the same at all. I actually tried the alternative before I tried DeodoMom to try to save money and experiment. I have been trying natural deodorants for about 4-5 years with no luck. I&#x27;m a 20-something, petite, thin, female with no health issues and I typically stink by noon at the latest. Very frustrating. Anyways- I&#x27;ve been using DeodoMom for about 3-4 weeks with amazing success. And trust me, this deodorant has gone through my most stressful days- I&#x27;m an occupational therapy intern at an acute psychiatric hospital. This stuff has definitely worked for me and I can&#x27;t say the same about the cheap store bought junk. I will definitely update this review if it stops working~ til then, I&#x27;m one happy stink-free lady!</li>
            <li> This product has been amazing for me.  Started having body odor about a year ago while using regular store-bought anti-perspirant.  Was washing and reapplying several times per day and still had odor. Nothing helped until I came across DeodoMom.  Was skeptical but willing to try.  I will never go back to other products, this stuff is amazing!!  Never any body odor, EVER! I do sometimes sweat because it is a deodorant not an anti-perspirant, but I do not mind so long as I smell good.</li>
            <li> this gave me a painful rash :(. i gave the rest away.</li>
            <li> So very pleased to find a safe deodorant that works so well. Have tried the crystal, Tom&#x27;s, &amp; various health food store ones, but they never worked well for me. This seemed so safe and works very well -just as well as all the clinical strength \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ingredient deodorants with aluminum in them. I think I&#x27;ll always use this deodorant. I tried the cream and want to try the roll-on next.</li>
            <li> Over the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of natural deodorants. The vast majority didn&#x27;t work at all or didn&#x27;t last, and the couple that did inevitably irritated my skin after a few weeks or months. It&#x27;s amazing how well DeodoMom works with just two ingredients. I only have to apply once in the morning and it works all day long, with not even a hint of irritation after months of use. If you&#x27;ve struggled to find an effective, safe deodorant, I highly recommend trying it (even if you&#x27;re a dude and a little gun shy about the name).</li>
            <li> Easy to use and absorbs quickly. Works all day.  Never burns or irritates after shaving. Glad I investigated something natural, I will never go back to OTC.</li>
            <li> I have tried every natural deodorant you can buy and every one made me break out in a painful rash. This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that hasn&#x27;t caused a rash &amp; it actually works! It works like an antiperspirant, in that I don&#x27;t sweat, but it doesn&#x27;t have any of the yucky chemicals! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant, but it really only lasts a little over a month. I apply it twice each day.</li>
            <li> DeodoMom is simply amazing. After a lifetime of wearing the big name anti-restaurants and deodorants, I have FINALLY found something I know is safe AND works incredibly well. I have told many people about this product and have no complaints about it except one with myself for not having discovered it sooner.  I love that the product is made in small batches to ensurefreshness and was custom made when I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and it works. I just put a dab on my index or middle finger and running my underarm. Absorbs and dries almost immediately.  When I use this, I don&#x27;t sweat or have odor and even more importantly I don&#x27;t have any concerns about toxic chemicals being leached into my bloodstream. I may add some essential oil to it during  the summer when I am wearing  sleeveless tops so I can get the benefit of fragrance but that is a matter of personal preference. For now I certainly appreciate that it is fragrance free and WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, DeodoMom for this amazing product. I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> This product really works!  I&#x27;m not concerned about sweating, because that is a natural process.  What I am concerned about is body odor, and this is the only natural deodorant product that has worked for me.  I have occasionally smelled an odor after a long day, but it is far less than what it would be without this deodorant. It generally works all day just fine.  It does not discolor or harm clothing that I can tell.  I don&#x27;t mind that it is in a cream form.  Keep the lid on it or it will dry out.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well.  A little leaked out during shipping. Please note, this is deoderant not antiperspirant. You will feel wet if you sweat. My complaint is the price for the amount you get. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and its almost gone and drying out. I only use it once per day and I was told I don&#x27;t stink. I probably will not purchase again due to the cost.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant, I bought it for my mom, husband and tell my friends about it too. I am a bit obsessed lately with the toxic chemicals that are in all of our household products, and I check all ingredients obsessively on the EWG website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was so happy to find this deodorant two years ago while I was breastfeeding, and continued to use it while pregnant and breastfeeding with my second. This will be my go to deodorant as long as they make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also keeps me from smelling all day, except on the hottest days when I am running around a lot, and then I only smell at the end of the day. It even keeps me dry most of the time, and that is better than I can say for most anti-perpirants that I have tried in the past. And this is just a deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that it is natural, only two ingredients, and effective. My only complaint is cost, but I think my health is worth it.</li>
            <li> I am a stinky girl. Seriously, I stink. When I decided to start buying cruelty free deodorant, I was very concerned my husband might leave me because I smelled so bad. I tried all kinds of deodorant and nothing worked. It got to the point where I was scared to hug my girlfriends bc I thought they might smell me. This stuff works!! It is amazing!! I put it on at night, right after my shower, and I smell fresh throughout the day! It truly is wonderful! Just make sure to twist the lid on tight bc it will dry up faster if you don&#x27;t. Also, I know putting lotion deodorant on seems strange at first, but I was putting lotion under my arms anyway bc I didn&#x27;t want my shaving cream to dry them out. Now it takes fewer steps! Love it! PS, my husband is so much happier now!</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have tried, and I have tried all kinds of natural ones. Either they give me a horrific rash (baking soda ones) or they don&#x27;t work at all (&amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; ones), or they make me smell even WORSE than if I don&#x27;t use anything at all (Lush deodorants).  But this, this just works. No smell at all at the end of the day. No rash, though at first it tingled a little when I applied it. Also, I have restless legs and so this is a great way for me to get some magnesium into my system for better sleep. Killing two birds with one stone!  The only slight drawback is that you have to wait a minute or so after applying before putting your top on. I usually apply it before I brush my teeth and then when I have done that I am good to go. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with stained clothes, which is nice, however sometimes I see a white chalky residue on the skin in my armpits. But that is a minor thing. All in all, I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few months, and I am loving it. I no longer use drugstore deodorant - in addition to being 100% natural, this is much more effective!</li>
            <li> I was using Jungleman deodorant and LOVED it, but it started to bother my skin so I had to switch to something else. I bought both DeodoMom and Lavilin to see which one worked best.  Lavilin: Lavilin claims it can stop odor for up to 7 days but that was FAR from the case for me as man. I even trimmed the hair in my armpits &#x27;way&#x27; back so it could get to the skin and that didn&#x27;t help either. It made me produce a strange indescribable smell from my armpits. Might have something to do with my body ph mixing with the ingredients in the Lavilin. I also had to apply it everyday or every-other-day for it to work. You get a very small quantity for the price.  DeodoMom: I had much better success with Deodomom over Lavilin. You get more product for your money and its cheaper. It also didn&#x27;t produce any strange smells like Lavilin did. I could also go 2 days without reapplying under normal circumstances. It also seems to stop me from sweating a little better.  I&#x27;ll be buying more of this one, however I give it 4 stars for now since I think $10 is a bit much for a few ounces of any deodorant.  6/01/15.....Follow-up: I now make my own DeodoMom. I ordered bulk (8.82oz) from Amazon and mixed with water to the consistency of thick hand lotion. Its very easy and you don&#x27;t really need a &#x27;perfect recipe&#x27; to do it. Just get a small container with a lid and mix till you like it. Its virtually impossible to mess up. One more tip, if it starts it starts to dry out in the container, just add a touch of water to it and maybe mix slightly. I have saved a lot of money by making my own. Don&#x27;t know if I will ever use anything else. Its better than normal deodorants and no more Aluminum!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very concerned about the things in commercial deodorant, such as aluminum that can absorb through your skin. However, I haven&#x27;t been very impressed with other natural deodorants that I have tried. I live in Tucson so body odor can quickly become a problem almost any time of the year. In the past I have just gone back to commercial deodorant just out of desperation for something that I know works.&lt;br /&gt;This came to my attention and came highly reviewed, so thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I have been very pleased with this product, the only drawback is in the nature of the ingredient to dry up/dissolve in air. I have learned to keep the jar as tightly closed as possible. To me it is worth that little trade off for actually having a natural product that works. The cream doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, as it seemed to in other people&#x27;s reviews. It isn&#x27;t oily, and has no discernible smell at all.</li>
            <li> So i had previously gotten the roll on version which I absolutely love! I got this one just to save the extra few bucks after my roll on was all gone thinking it would work exactly the same just different packaging. Now idk what it is about this one but it seemed to go faster, it&#x27;s almost like it dried up no matter how well i sealed it. Also for some reason it just does not work as well for me. I&#x27;m stinky by mid day and with the roll on i could go about 2 days without smelling. I just do not like this packaging. I would definitely recommend the roll on! it&#x27;s more convenient and just works better, couldn&#x27;t tell you why though. I&#x27;ll be paying the 2 extra bucks for the roll on from now on.</li>
            <li> This product is effective in controlling odor.  I have tried other products - some of them are too greasy or not as effective. I was pleasantly surprised. You only have to use a tiny amount. It&#x27;s texture is more like a lotion and not a cream, but it works.</li>
            <li> Awful. It did not work at all. I don&#x27;t all of the positive reviews... It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It works well, and has no fragrance.</li>
            <li> i was really hoping this product would work because i&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant that truly does. it seems to be an individual reaction to one&#x27;s body chemistry from what i&#x27;ve read, and my body must not have responded to it. since it obviously works for many others and shipped really promptly i&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I have tried various deodorants since deciding to find a natural deodorant.  This works ALL day, unlike my former version from Tom&#x27;s.  I was skeptical to try this at first, but it has proven to me that it works.  I am an active person (run, cycle, triathlons) and this works great through all those activities.  I have only tried the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; version so far.</li>
            <li> I must share how pleased I am with this deodorant! It&#x27;s amazing and extremely effective:) It still allows you to sweat which is a good thing so you&#x27;r pores don&#x27;t get clogged. It has no smell yet takes care of any body odors that would naturally occur. This product works for a full 24 hrs after I apply it. I am completely satisfied and recommend everyone to give it a try! thank you for  this new creation that is now in my life, tangi hayes</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product totally warrants it. After years of \\&quot;trying out\\&quot; organic and natural deodorant products, I have finally found one that works! And by golly it works soooo well. I don&#x27;t even have to use it every day! Hooray!!!</li>
            <li> My wife and I are both using DeodoMom and it&#x27;s nothing short of amazing. We&#x27;ve tried all the rest of so call natural deodorants and this is by far the best! Everybody&#x27;s chemistry is different, but for us it works like no other we&#x27;ve tried. Amazing product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after she constantly broke out in rashes from conventional deodorant. She seemed to really like it and found that it worked just as good if not better than the old stuff. Don&#x27;t expect this to keep you from sweating, but do expect that you won&#x27;t stink...even after a good work out at the gym. (She made me do the sniff test to prove it.) The only bad thing, and something that might make her not buy it again, was it dried out. The jar doesn&#x27;t seem to be good enough to keep the product fresh. Over-all, good product.</li>
            <li> This is a great and much needed product I will purchase the product again, thank you for producing something useful</li>
            <li> Got this for my teenage daughter, who was complaining that the non aluminum deodorants I had been purchasing (Tom&#x27;s and another (?)brand from our local health food store) didn&#x27;t work for her.  She was getting really embarrassed about her body odor.  Saw positive reviews for this, so thought we&#x27;d try it.  She was hesitant at first about the &amp;#34;applying it with your fingers&amp;#34; aspect of it.  But she&#x27;s been using it for 6 months and she really loves it!  So glad I was able to find a non toxic deodorant that works, for my daughter, THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and &#x27;conventional&#x27; aluminum-containing antiperspirants seem to clog my lymph nodes, which in turn, leads to nickle-size pus-filled lumps under my armpits. So I have been searching for an effective natural deodorant down through the years and only one of them seemed to work mildly (E Plus High C Natural roll-on deodorant by Aubrey Organics). I just got tired of the calamine lotion-like scent of E Plus High C and wondered if there was something better out there. So I tried DeodoMom, and for me, it did keep body odor away for about 2 days. But eventually, I started to notice a small painful lump developing in my armpit and I knew that it was the result of DeodoMom. I really wanted this deodorant to work for me, but I guess it&#x27;s not compatible with my body chemistry. At this point, I don&#x27;t think that I will ever use deodorant again because I&#x27;m too leery after this recent experience. I am still waiting for the lump to completely go down (it has gone down some). So anyway, I gave it 3-star review because it did keep body odor away for a few days, which was slightly impressive for a natural deodorant. But I couldn&#x27;t give it 5-stars because I experienced a negative reaction to it. This would probably be an effective deodorant for someone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t have a history of experiencing armpit lumps from deodorants.</li>
            <li> Finally! An aluminum-free deodorant that actually works, regardless of the temperature outside. I highly recommend this deodorant for each member of the family.</li>
            <li> Finally a deodorant that I&#x27;m not allergic to! For at least 15 years I have been struggling with my odor issues. I have tried so many brands of deodorants (Degree, Tom&#x27;s, Secret, Speed Stick, Arm and Hammer, Axe, old spice) and no matter what, I break out into a huge rash and feel the pain for weeks. I honestly was scared to try this stuff, but OMG IT WORKS! No Pain, No odor! I wish I could hug the inventor. Because dealing with odor issues has been a life long struggle. People with bad odor are avoided by everyone, worst of all the ladies! Im a military blue collar worker who normally has to shower 3 times a day to control the stench. And for once I can say I am a happy customer. Thank you for your product!</li>
            <li> With other deodorants I would get a red rash with skin peeling... but after two months of using this I haven&#x27;t had any issues. Using a small amount dries the area and surprisingly works all day. I wish I had been using it all along.</li>
            <li> I had been using another natural, non-aluminum cream deodorant for about a year when I decided to try DeodoMom.  It was scented with tea tree oil, and the smell was starting to become overpowering.  I really like that DeodoMom is unscented.  I was already used to the slightly sweaty feeling that comes with wearing a deodorant without an antiperspirant, and I actually found that DeodoMom keeps me fairly dry which was a nice surprise.  After a long day, especially if it&#x27;s warm, I do feel a little stinky - but that happens with any deodorant.  I think I&#x27;m going to get a roll-on to keep at work so I can reapply if I need to.  Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this product and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh or irritating ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and when the first jar they sent me got broken in the mail, they were really nice and sent me a free replacement right away.</li>
            <li> I initially tried deodomom due to the fact that my typical hypoallergenic deodorant started causing a painful underarm rash.  Since switching to deodomom, the rash has completely disappeared.  I do miss the fresh scent of my old deodorant, but that was possibly one of the causes of the rash. Though this has no scent, it still keeps the stink away.  Applying with my fingers was a little strange at first, but soon became no big deal, though I will try the roll on next for comparison.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that works, and it works damn well. I&#x27;m amazed that I can detect no odor even after a couple days. Seems too good to be true, but it&#x27;s now my daily experience.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! A small amount works great so it is a great value.</li>
            <li> It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far.  The only negative thing is that it&#x27;s messy to apply because it&#x27;s the texture of lotion.  But I can get over it given that I don&#x27;t smell anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased deodomom after reading the reviews. I&#x27;m trying to switch to all natural products as my fiancé and I plan to start a family after our wedding. I&#x27;ve tried numerous all natural deodorants and I smell bad by half way through the day! Deodomom gets me through the day! I do wish they offered a scented version also. I will definitely continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Like many people trying to avoid harmful ingredients, I&#x27;ve tried countless natural antiperspirants like The Crystal and Tom&#x27;s with limited success. The Crystal, for example, was effective in the short term, but gave me really irritated skin after repeated use. Tom&#x27;s and other similar deodorants just made me armpits an immediate irritated mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually gave up my search for awhile and resigned myself to Secret Unscented, which wasn&#x27;t irritating, but had a long list of chemicals I was not a fan of. Finally, after an exhaustive search for top-rated antiperspirants I gave this roll-on as well as the jar version a try. I am so thankful I did because both actually work just as well as my Secret Unscented! I prefer the roll-on most days because of the convenience factor, but when I have some time I do the jar as it allows me to put on a thicker coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this stuff is I can apply it after shaving with no irritation, which sets it apart from every other natural deodorant and antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:&lt;br /&gt;- Always let it try completely before putting on clothing. I am impatient, so I just use a hairdryer on the cool setting.:)</li>
            <li> Have been trying various natural deodorants for the last 4 years and wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results until I tried DeodoMom. It doesn&#x27;t stop me from sweating, but I sweat less and I don&#x27;t smell by the end of the day! All the other natural deodorants would wear off by midday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter loves it as well. She is thrilled that after her dance class each week, she doesn&#x27;t smell like she was just dancing for 4 hrs. We have only used it in winter, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I Have been looking for strong, safe healthy deodorant and I thought it didn&#x27;t exist. Even many of the healthy ones have ingredients that make me uncomfortable. I found a link and review to DeodoMom and thought it was too good to be true. I went with the jar instead of the roll on as the review thought that it worked better. I could not be happier! It holds up to long and sweaty days and covers any smell. I was really so surprised. I had been looking for so long and I really didn&#x27;t have to look anymore! Try this product, you won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! It is made so simply, which is exactly what I look for in products, and for me it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I find that I usually need to reapply once (maybe twice on a toasty day).&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product to my sisters, who also agreed it is great, and they have both switched to DeodoMom.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend that anyone give this a try.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful deoderant alternative to the common ones that contain aluminum and other harmful ingredients. I have been using this deoderant for a few weeks now and am very happy with it. My only complaint about it is that it isn&#x27;t actually an antiperspirant, so you will still sweat. It lasts 24 hours or so, but if you don&#x27;t wash it off and reapply daily it won&#x27;t continue to work. Highly reccomend though as it dies completely and does not typically leave behind any residue on clothes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used natural deodorants for years and have never found one I liked this much. It&#x27;s light invisible and long lasting. I put it on after my morning shower and am still stink free when I wake up next morning. Even my previous favorite, PitPowder, had to be reapplied a couple times throughout the day in order to keep stinky-ness at bay. Though the PitPowder could actually absorb and reverse nasty odors whereas I find this product works only if applied after bathing. I have sensitive skin and this deodorant --the cream-- is soothing even right after shaving. So happy to have something with good simple ingredients that really works!</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe this works!!! i have struggled my whole life with stinkiness....NOTHING worked, the dreaded antiperspirant with aluminum, the crystal, toms, lavilin, and various other naturals. I have been going CRAZY trying to find something that works, wasting a lot of time and money, not to mention, sacrificing some relationships, I&#x27;m sure! ;) I always ended up smelling like an open sewer by day&#x27;s end. i decided to give this a try based on the excellent reviews, and I am ECSTATIC!! Now, everyone in my household is happy I&#x27;ve discovered this product, and we can all get on with our lives. :)</li>
            <li> This is a milk of magnesia cream that works great and dries quickly.  The company says this should appeal to women more than men.  Well I&#x27;m male and it just suits me perfectly.  My one criticism is they should provide it in a larger amount.</li>
            <li> I have used many other deodorants and went behind every advertised product. Everything worked for few hours, not more than that.  I have wasted lot of $$$$. I have come across this product in Amazon and decided to try this as part of my trying process. Finally my search has ended...and I am extremely happy/satisfied with this product. Give it a try and definitely you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I am going to make my comment very short about this product...it doesn&#x27;t work!!! after 2 to 3 hours sweating the protection is not longer there, I live in South Florida, this product isn&#x27;t strong enough for this type of climate, to be honest TOM&#x27;s natural deodorant offers more protection than this product for less money I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25 y.o female and inherited my dad&#x27;s heavy sweating genes. Deodorant + antiperspirants from grade school on was a daily routine. I regret that, however, as I&#x27;ve lately been made aware of the various dangerous and unnecessary ingredients in common and well-known deodorants/antiperspirants. &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; brands typically haven&#x27;t done the trick against smell. And while I&#x27;m NOT an expecting mother, I LOVE DeodoMom. I accept my wetness as a natural means of cooling off, but this product (along with daily underarm washing) is finally an effective defense against the smell. Lasts all day, and I actually wash my tops less frequently (what?!). Thanks, DeodoMom!</li>
            <li> First of all, some background on me - I really want to use aluminum free/natural deodorants but I have a problem with stress sweat and so often have to use &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorant to keep this somewhat in check when I am at functions or events (twice a week).  For the rest of my life I use the natural deodorants and just know I&#x27;m gonna have a little BO at some point in the day.  No one in my house complains.  With that said, when I first got the DeodoMom ( i have the jar) I was AMAZED - i went ALL DAY ( a normal day around the house) with absolutely NO BO.  This happened three days in a row.  On the fourth day, it seemed to not be effective anymore.  It&#x27;s strange because I saw another user with this same experience. I have found, though, that if I give DeodoMom a break for about a week or so I can get another 3 good days out of it.  Not sure why this is, but I am ok with it since it&#x27;s such a good price and for those 3 days it does seem to be more effective than my other natural deodorant stand-by (which just masks the BO with a lovely scent).  DeodoMom has no scent, which I kinda like.  I definitely say give it a go.  The company is great.  Great service.</li>
            <li> Had to write a review on this as i&#x27;m sure there are people out there struggling to find a natural deodorant that works. I&#x27;ve spent a fortune trying what seems like all of them and all I ever got was deodorant that worked for an hour ir horrible underarm rashes. I&#x27;m a heavy sweater also. This product is amazing and I can&#x27;t actually understand how it works so well. After you get out of the shower you appky a small amount. The texture is a water light lotion. Strangely this product dries super fast and actually keeps your armpits dry and odor free. This worked for me for an entire day which is miraculous compared to everything else i&#x27;ve tried. If you try to use on armpits that arent clean it won&#x27;t work as well so keep that in mind. I have not tried the roll on so that might be more convenient for some people. I contacted the company and they immediately sent me a sample so it cost me nothing to try it. If you&#x27;re like me and have tried everything and are about to give up I would definitely try this first!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Works!! No rash...no BO for up to 2 days with 1 application.  Need very little to be effective. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think this made my armpits smell exponentially worse.  At least my son and husband had a good laugh at my expense.  Until I started flapping my arms in the air like a chicken spreading the stink...mom got the last laugh.</li>
            <li> The only ingredients in plain milk of magnesia are magnesium hydroxide and water, the same ingredients in DeodoMom.  Just pour some in a cup, and let it dry for a couple of days.  You can usually get a generic 12 ounce bottle of MoM for less than $2.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this only for 5 days, but so far I am hooked. I use probably about a dime amount per day (at night after I shower, before bed) for both armpits. I was using a mix of normal Secret/Degree deodorant/antiperspirant and alternating with scented Tom&#x27;s deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far for me, the DeodoMom has been working a lot better than Tom&#x27;s. I feel like I sweat less, and the smell is much less irritating. I do have some BO after exercise and toward the end of the day, but my shirts don&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as with Tom&#x27;s (mix of sickly sweet scent from the deodorant + BO). And, I&#x27;m assuming with no aluminum or alcohol that this is much better for me than the OTC antiperspirant (which I love using for anti-sweat and scent, but trying to reduce the chemicals I put on my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sensitivity issues noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically jog or do weights a few times a week, and spend time outdoors and walking on weekends, so it hasn&#x27;t gotten the full gamut of my own personal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure on longevity of the jar, as it is fairly small, but I&#x27;m guessing it should last me at least 2 months, and I plan to buy more once I&#x27;m out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was pretty quick, and the product had to travel cross country, and the personalized lid label was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I really liked using this product for the first few days.  Then it began to dry out very quickly.  After it dried out the effectiveness wasn&#x27;t there.  t bought the jar and it was full, within a week it was almost empty.  I read 1 other review stating the same thing happened to them. I always kept it sealed very tightly.  I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> we are always looking for healthy products to use that will not put chemicals on to our skin.  This deodorant works better then I thought it would and now my wife uses it too.  Holds up well except in extreme heat like 95 degree days but in those conditions what does.  I have the cream and it spreads very easy but I also want to try the roll on and will update later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the perfect natural deodorant for quite some time now. I&#x27;ve tried many and most have not worked as well as the non natural deodorant that I was using. Even with the non natural deodorant, I still had some issues with sweating and stinking. I&#x27;m a small lady, but man does bacteria grow in my pits! I still sweat somewhat with this at times (which is to be expected) and on a really hot day I may stink a tiny bit, but this is one of the best that I can find. I also liked the Pit Powder about the same. The only reason that I continue to look for a perfect natural deodorant is because of the application of both. I&#x27;m not crazy about a roll on (too wet), a cream, or powder (too messy). I just wish they could make one in stick form. That would be perfect!</li>
            <li> I love that there are absolutely no harmful ingredients in this deodorant. I am not pregnant, I just wanted to use something that didn&#x27;t contain nasty chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using my Dove deodorant (with aluminum, parabens, and a host of other unnatural things) as soon as I placed my order for DeodoMom. My underarms must have been so clogged up with the bad stuff; it took a full three days for my armpits to sweat again while I was waiting for it to come in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;I love DeodoMom- it doesn&#x27;t stop all the sweating, but I think it helps. I have only sweat from my underarms for a couple days out of the two months I have been using this (and they were days where the temperature reached above 115). You only need a tiny amount- if your armpit turns white you have used too much.&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both use this, and it stops ALL odor. We have not had a whisper of a bad scent come from either of us the entire time we have been using this (and we live in Phoenix).&lt;br /&gt;Just read the ingredient list of your other deodorants, and you might not feel comfortable rubbing that into your skin every single day.</li>
            <li> I have tried various products but have had no success.  I would always have a bad odor.  This product keeps me smelling fresh the whole day with just one application.  And best of all is the low price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - have been using it for several weeks. Love the fact that it is not loaded up with chemicals. Will repurchase.g</li>
            <li> I have also been on the search for what feels like my whole life to find a natural deo that actually works. I had resigned to using old spice for the last 4 years (I actually sweat and I actually smell) but decided to start the search again. After reading reviews I tried this one and my friends don&#x27;t believe me when I say I&#x27;ve found THE ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must have clean pits for it to work, so I put it on after I shower in the morning and again at night before I go to bed if I want to squeeze another day out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the jar which is fine, but over time it seems like it&#x27;s solidified more (perhaps with air exposure), and thus compacted quite a bit. Not unhappy, just curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m deodomom all the way</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as advertised. If you haven&#x27;t used natural deodorant options before, you should know ahead of time that they will not prevent you from sweating, but they do minimize or eliminate odor from sweat. My only complaint about this product was that it dried up into a thick paste quickly even though I kept it closed very tightly in a cool room. Still, I was able to rub the paste on w/ the same results so it didn&#x27;t really matter. And, honestly the paste was less likely to spill in my travel bag. Good product,  lasted about 2 months of daily use &amp; I&#x27;m re-ordering.</li>
            <li> It really works! And, it has no harmful chemicals in it which is important to me as I was just treated for breast cancer and told by my doctors to avoid aluminum in deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had seen this recommend by another breast cancer lady in a forum discussion on finding healthy products. Most of us had been trying the usual drug store deodorant products that did not contain aluminum, but had found they didn&#x27;t work. When I saw a second recommendation for it from another woman, I decided to order and try it. I am so glad I did because, honestly, it works. It&#x27;s a lovely light creme and a tiny bit on finger tip smoothed over the under arm area does the job. I stay &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; free all day, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Worked wonderfully! Didn&#x27;t get any rash or anything weird. Best deodorant! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This was one of three deodorants I purchased when I started to get an allergic reaction to regular deodorants/antiperspirants and looked for a more sensitive, natural product.  Out of the 3, this would be my second choice. It works very well and kept me dry.  I had no negative reactions to it at all.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the application process.  I am usually in a rush to get to work, and after applying DeodoMom to my underarms with my fingers, I had to wash my hands again - which was one additional minute in my morning ritual. One of the three products I purchased worked as well, and had the standard dry-stick shape I am used to, so I opted to use that product from now on.</li>
            <li> Effective deodorant!!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sad to say I am too stinky for this deodorant. I live in Hawaii so I have hot and humidity working against me and with body chemistry this did absolutely nothing. It didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation and it went on smoothly (hence the 2 stars) but this did nothing to keep the BO in check. I also bought the roll-on and had the same exact results (massive stank).</li>
            <li> In the last couple years it&#x27;s been mandatory for health reasons for me to switch to less toxic products. Of all the products I replaced a healthier alternative deodorant was the most challenging. And it was the most important! So frustrating. I&#x27;ve wasted tons of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I bother? I tested high for aluminum and off the charts with zirconium in a health test. Check your deodorant, it&#x27;s probably got that combo in it. Neither are easy to get out of your body once they are at toxic levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried numerous other natural deodorants and they either were stinky or they made my armpits sore. Some even burned. Not good options. I&#x27;d gotten so desperate I had made my own (with decent results) but decent is not good enough for me! I have a bionic nose so any smell is not an option for me or anyone else around me. (smile)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say I am finally happy with a natural deodorant. I use the jar kind. It does make the underarm a bit white, but honestly, I don&#x27;t care. I just want something safe that works. Thanks to Deodomom.</li>
            <li> Like many people who are allergic to the aluminum found in almost all antiperspirant-deodorant products, I have been looking for an alternative for a long time.  I have tried just about all the deodorants on the market and found them to be ineffective - almost like using nothing. I am very glad to have found DeodoMom. I&#x27;ve used both the roll-on and cream and found them both good.  If I  had to make a choice, I would pick the cream.</li>
            <li> This deodorant worked fairly well (&amp; I have a really tough time finding any deodorant that works for me). However, the container is annoying, &amp; mine dried up extremely fast. It would be better in a pump. I just saw they have a roller too so I&#x27;ll try that instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried zillions of natural deodorants, and it seems to be just trial and error to determine what works well with your body chemistry. In my opinion, any natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t work for you just doesn&#x27;t work for *you*. I&#x27;m sure they all work well for someone. And none has worked for me except this stuff! I tried both this (the DeodoMom cream) and the DeodoMom roll on, and the cream worked better for me than the roll on. I&#x27;m so glad my natural deodorant search is over! If this one doesn&#x27;t work for you - that&#x27;s a bummer! I sincerely hope the next one you try does.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy good!  I&#x27;ve tried countless deodorants and antiperspirants through the years and none of them have worked.  This is the best organic deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this stuff. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it is a huge plus. I&#x27;ve been using commercial deodorant and sometimes the extra-dry (read: heavy aluminum content) deodorant because I don&#x27;t want the stink in my clothes (doesn&#x27;t work). Hate the scent of deodorants that I buy in store, even the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones aren&#x27;t for me. This has no smell. It works for me, which was a relief, as it states in the info that it doesn&#x27;t work with everyone. I&#x27;m buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stop the wetness, but I don&#x27;t care. As long as I&#x27;m odor-free, I&#x27;m happy and my clothes don&#x27;t stink like pit smell anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t leave the cap off...I did one day and it didn&#x27;t dry out but I put a little bit of distilled water in it to put the moisture back into the product and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am reordering again because it worked so well for me.</li>
            <li> I might as well rub vaseline or lotion on my arms.It did nothing to stop the odor.Just doesnt  work.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have purchased the roll on, which would have given me better coverage!</li>
            <li> Originally bought it for my 8 &amp; 11 year-old daughters because of the limited ingredients, but found that it worked great for me too! It can last for 1 to 2 days between showers, and it hasn&#x27;t irritated anyone&#x27;s sensitive skin. Since you only need a small amount, I think the jar will last for some time. Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Dries up FAST - within 3 weeks - even with the cover on.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective natural deodorant I have found. I tried Tom&#x27;s and Vermont Soap&#x27;s (great products, BTW - try their organic foaming hand soap!!), but neither worked for me. I think everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different and thus you have to find what works for you. DeodoMom works great for me!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now; I started using it before I was pregnant and am still using it while nursing. It allows your body to perspire, but blocks the smell. I prefer this cream version to the bottle version. I tried the bottle type once and found it too runny. It still worked well, I just found the cream easier to apply.  Awesome product!!</li>
            <li> I just received my jar of white WATER today, there was nothing cream about it.I really don&#x27;t know what happened but it&#x27;s just closed liquid.I was really excited to use this but unfortunately because of the texture I just wasted money.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s all I can say. This just did not work for me, although I like the idea behind it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slowly been moving to more natural products, and other all natural deoderants were not working. I had heard of milk of magnesia working, but wanted a product without the extra stuff. This has been great. I think it works better than secret brand, which I kept on hand for events  that I was not comfortable with the idea of sweating through, and I do sweat, a lot. But not anymore. Well not totally sweat free, I can&#x27;t even get that with the  commercial brand.</li>
            <li> Great, great product.  The notorious underarm stains that result from conventional anti-perspirants are gone from my clothes.  This product will not hinder your perspiration, but will counteract the sweaty smell.</li>
            <li> Amazing deodorant! Ex college-athlete who previously used Old Spice and a few other anti-perspirants. Then I switched to Tom&#x27;s to avoid aluminum and it made sweating and smelling way worse. This stuff works wonders! I can sweat naturally through it, but absolutely no smell! Great for people who sweat often and A LOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally....no smell. Weird, makes me wonder if there is a secret ingredient that scientists don&#x27;t know about in this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was very optimistic but unfortunatly this product did not work as described. It did not stop or mask odor as stated and it was very white and chalky on my skin. Im very disappointed as I read the reviews and had high expectations.</li>
            <li> I purchased the roll on and sadly it didn&#x27;t work. I wrote a review and the people at DeodoMom sent me the cream for free.  The cream works.. I have worn it to hot yoga several times and I think I finally found my natural deodorant! Thanks to DeodoMom for fantastic customer service and great product!</li>
            <li> Good product, but dried out and became rather useless within weeks. Jar was always sealed shut. Very disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural deodorant that actually works! I have been searching for a natural deodorant with simple, safe ingredients that works for years. I am so happy to have found this one. I&#x27;ve only tried the cream version, and I am very satisfied. I&#x27;ve thrown my regular deodorants away. This one is great for sensitive skin...I&#x27;ve had no irritation.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!  It actually works and does not leave any odor or stain on my clothing.  The best part is that it is all natural!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I quit using harsh deodorants within the last year, they didn&#x27;t help with body odor anyway! I&#x27;ve spent over $100 trying different natural deodorants, and while I&#x27;ve found some I like, this has been the best. I love that you have the option of a cream or roll on. I&#x27;ve only tried the cream so far, and plan on trying the roll on next. I live a very humid part of TX, so no matter what I use, I have to apply more than once a day. I&#x27;d say Deodomom and Jason in apricot scent are the best, but the Jason&#x27;s leaves underarms feeling sticky when you begin to sweat. Deodomom leaves a clean feeling even when you sweat. I really like this deodorant, and will absolutely continue to use it. I recommend for anyone who has body odor issues or just wants to make the switch to something natural without any glycol! This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since last summer, and have had a great experience!  I&#x27;ve had no problems (that I&#x27;ve noticed or anyone has mentioned to me) with odor.  I absolutely love using a product that is so safe it could be routinely ingested!  The product is like a thin cream (but entirely water based) and a small dab spreads easily, so the jar lasts me several months.  There&#x27;s a little white residue where the product went on, but it comes off in an instant with a little water or a slightly damp cloth, so it&#x27;s great for days where one is wearing black or a tank top.  There&#x27;s no anti-persperant component, which could be an issue for some people on some days.  Also, one slight downside is the packaging.  The jar will leak if packed with other toiletries, so I keep it in a separate ziplock bag.  The roll-on version of the product travels better, but takes a little longer to dry after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking out a safe alternative to conventional deodorants.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of alternative products, and nothing has beaten this in terms of efficacy, and certainly nothing comes close in terms of purity.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I really have no problems with smelling or sweating when I use it. The only down sides is that it&#x27;s wet at first but it dries fast and it gets on my clothes. It does run out sort of fast but I may be using too much at a time. I am buying it again though.  30someweeks was great sending me a replacement order for free when I complained about the first shipment leaking. They were really nice and cared about their service.</li>
            <li> I love that there are minimal ingredients, and it is one of the only natural deodorants I&#x27;ve used that not only doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin, but also works.  I&#x27;m a relatively recent convert from regularly using anti perspirant to exclusively using deodorant so I&#x27;m still getting used to the feeling of sweating more, but really, this is the first natural deodorant I can see myself sticking with.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old son who has been wearing deodorant since he was 4. We tried Tom&#x27;s, Jason, and Crystal and all of them eventually stopped working. I was looking for something natural to replace Degree for myself and my son. He has been using it for 2 weeks and it has worked like a charm. Like others have said, it does need some drying time but the cream only takes about a minute or two to dry. I am very impressed and I am going to recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I have tried them all! This one actually works, and I live in AZ where its already over 100 degrees. I have the cream one, I just dab a little on and I&#x27;m set for the day. It dries fast too, which is nice. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a natural deo alternative.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants with no success. The deodorants ( I will not mention by names) left me smelly, musty, stinky...just down right unpleasant. I was about to give up hope and go back to the commercial un natural brands, but I came across DeodoMom. My order was received very fast and I began to use immediately. After 3 weeks of use...I am very pleased. I am still sweaty as I sweat a lot, but I am no longer smelly, musty and stinky. I recommend this deodorant to anyone that is looking to find a natural brand.</li>
            <li> I tried so many other natural deoderants, but none work anywere near as good as this!  Plus, this is entirely aluminum free (unliked the salt deoderants, which contain aluminum!).  I highly recommend this product and am buying another one for my boyfriend.  Also, tou need so little of it that this jar will last a looong time.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found a deodorant with natural ingredients, no harsh chemicals, and just a few ingredients THAT WORKS!!  I&#x27;ve tried so many others, but I will continue to purchase this over and over again.  I&#x27;ve already placed my 2nd order!</li>
            <li> Who would of thought constipation medicine would be a great pit deodorant.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very picky about the products he uses, and after trying MANY different natural deodorants he settled on this one as his favorite. He loved the natural ingredients that didn&#x27;t stain his clothes, and it did a great job of keeping body odor at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing he didn&#x27;t like was that after putting it on, his armpits felt more moist than with stick deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have every written.  I am willing to write a review because I feel everyone should know about this product and use it.  DeodoMom is safe, non-toxic and actually works!  This is the only natural deodorant I have tried that keeps my underarms from being smelly and does so for over 24 hours.  My whole family uses it and it works for everyone.</li>
            <li> i order a lot from Amazon...I mean a lot and never once have I felt compelled to write a review. But this deodorant deserves a review. I have been desperate to find a non-toxic alternative to commercial deodorant and I have tried everything. I don&#x27;t know if I have incredibly sensitive skin but everything from lush to Toms broke me out in a horrible rash! (Incidentally at the time of this post I am still recovering from Toms...darn you sir) I decided to give it one last go before resigning to my fate as the stinky girl at work. And low and behold I find deodomom and its life saving powers! This works brilliantly on me! I stay dry all day and guess what...no smell! I highly recommend this to all the potential stinky girls (and guys) refusing to lift their arms at work!</li>
            <li> absolutely perfect, keeps you dry all day, no residue, no fragrance.  Works great on my very sensitive skin and no harsh chemicals.  I prefer the roll-on over the cream as it is easier and quicker to apply, my daughter has the cream so I was able to sample.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works, but as long as those with aluminum in them.</li>
            <li> After years of trying various natural deodorant I have finally found one that really works.  Due to medical problems I sweat alot.  I am very antichemical and refuse to expose my body to your average chemical laden deodorant.  I found deodomom cream while pregnant and have been using it ever since.  I used to carry deodorant in my purse to reapply, but with deodomom just the one application first thing in the morning lasts all day. No more carrying deodorant in my purse. I have tried both the cream and the roll on.  Both work great.  Love it, Love it, love it!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Works better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve found and also love that its free of toxins and metals. I feel like I sweat easily and have tried lots of different deodorants, even &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength ones, but this one still works so much better those. Its doesn&#x27;t smell, and I can put it on once in the morning and go all day without reapplying on a normal day. The cream seemed kind of weird at first but it dries very quickly so its still easy to use. Also a plus, doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothing so I can wear it with dark tank tops. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the first deodorant that has worked for me in years and years. I plan to be a repeat customer for sure. The product keeps me dry without irritation and neutralizes any hint of odor. Great product so far. I grew up allergic to all deodorants, powders, and deodorant soaps. No change after 20 years in the Army and plus 15 years or so. I can&#x27;t even use &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; products because there is always something in them that will prove to be an irritant or cause a rash. I am grateful that your product is effective. I gave this 5 Stars because it works very well; and this product has the perfect balance for easy application.</li>
            <li> Finding an all natural deodorant that actually works AND does not give me an allergic reaction is my &amp;#34;white whale&amp;#34;. I stopped using commercial deodorants because of the aluminum and chemical ingredients. Since then I have tried all of the natural brands sold in health food stores (Tom&#x27;s, Kiss My Face, etc.) and found that they did not protect against body odor. I switched to the Soapwalla brand deodorant cream, which is all natural and comes in a jar. The cream effectively masks odor but started to give me a rash because it still contains skin irritating ingredients such as lavender, tea tree, and peppermint. I was hoping the Deodomom product would be the solution to my problems as it claims to be hypoallergenic and contains only two ingredients. The product arrived quickly in a cute package with a little label with my name written on it on top of the jar. The instructions caution you to only use a tiny amount of the cream because otherwise it leaves a white powdery residue on your skin. You really only need to apply a small amount. This deodorant works better than a lot of other things (such as the salt crystal) and it didn&#x27;t make me feel like I smelled like a hippie. My only complaint is that the cream started drying up inside the jar. Every time I open it it seems like there is less product inside. I am going to try the roll-on version and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market that had natural claims and nothing worked at all.  Well one did and its the kiss my face liquid roll on but it wasn&#x27;t really natural!  DeodoMom is a deodorant not an antiperspirant and works no matter how much I sweat.  The only difference is that you have to dab on the cream with your finger and only use a little at a time during application as to not waste or leave a white residue.  It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing and is very gentle on freshly shaven skin as well.  Its very simple and totally worth the little effort.  It even works incredibly for more than 24 hours as I have slept in really late on my days off.  I love this stuff so much!  A $100+ later the search is finally over!  I have been using it for over 2 weeks and am finally rest assured that I can stop checking my underarms regularly to see if I smell.  I am buying one for every woman I know...family first though.  I especially love how they put my name on the jar and spelled it right too &#x3D;)  Shipping was fast even though I live in Hawaii and guess what? They shipped to me for free!  I am now forever their loyal customer!  Its totally worth the money and will be stocking up soon!  Just try for yourself...I hope they never change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update****&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong and working through this tropical summer. I contacted the seller and asked if I would compromise the effectiveness of their product by adding some vanilla essential oil diluted with jojoba and they gave me immediate feedback and suggestions on how much to add so now my deo smells like vanilla and is very meoisturizing and still works great! Now I have more deo too..Finally a company who deserves my hard earned money in exchange for goods that actually do what they promise! I ride a bike all through town 6 days a week to and from work as well as catch the bus and this stuff can keep up with me!</li>
            <li> After trying a couple dozen of natural and conventional deodorants I haven&#x27;t found a better option than deodomom. It&#x27;s unscented which is a big deal to me and it keeps me dry, you don&#x27;t get that out of any &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product out there. So grateful I found them.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!!!  I finally found a deordorant that is effective at neutralizing underarm odor.  I have been using it for the last four days and have not experienced any burn whatsoever, nor has it lost its effectiveness.  I will definitely be reordering when it comes time to do so, but that won&#x27;t be for awhile because you need to use so little that I can see this jar lasing the rest of the year.  Kudos to DeodoMom!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product on Facebook so I tried it, and have recommended to several family members and friends.  I have never found ANY natural products that worked as well as Deodomom deodorant.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin, did not irritate my underarms. Worked for approx. 4 hours and then I needed to reapply. I love that I did not get a rash and that it still worked without harsh chemicals. Thanks for a good product!</li>
            <li> I was using the crystal deodorant, with good results, until the People&#x27;s Pharmacy said it is made of alum, which is aluminum, and still could possibly be bad for you. I gave this cream deodorant a try, not thinking it would work, and it was great. It never dries out my skin like the crystal sometimes did. It is a soft, white cream. I can use it after I get a shower at night, then again, after cleaning off, in the morning. No problem using it after shaving, either.  I go to exercise class with no problems in the stink department, too. I have not tried it in summer yet, but I don&#x27;t see the heat as being a problem. I wonder if it would have worked in my teens and 20s when hormones are high. For me it was a great find, and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. They personalize the jar by printing out your name on a label for the top. I thought that was cute.</li>
            <li> After trying several natural deodorants, I was about to give up hope of discovering something that worked for me as well as aluminum products, but this little jar of magic truly does.  With only 2 ingredients I was doubtful, but it is remarkable. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try--it is that good! I still sweat when working out, but even then, there is never a strong odor.  I have been amazed by how well DeodoMom does the job. Good to note, I&#x27;ve used it daily for over six weeks to give it ample time before posting a review and have experienced no negative side effects or disappointments to date.  Another positive is that it takes very little of the product to be effective.  I anticipate this little jar should last for months.  Well done, DeodoMom!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. Initial packaging was poor but replacement package was much better. I like that its natural and I&#x27;m not allergic to it, no reactions thus far.</li>
            <li> After searching for almost a year for something that didn&#x27;t break me out after a matter of days or weeks, I have finally found it.  Prior to this I was using a homemade deodorant from a vendor on Etsy, but I grew tired of the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; scent and it stained my t-shirts.  It is with slight apprehension that I ordered this after stumbling across it on a blog.  I placed my first order on Amazon and in days it arrived.  Having gone through this countless times before, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  But to my surprise, I wore it for almost four weeks with no issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted the company directly for a sample of the roll on, they were very courteous and sent me a free sample as I wanted to try the roll on before reordering the cream.  I tried the roll on for about a week or so and it just didn&#x27;t seem to work the same for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cream version of their product and they now have a lifelong customer - MY SEARCH IS OVER!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled to find a deodorant that really cuts down on odor while not irritating my skin. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands as well as homemade versions and I&#x27;ve had middling results. I bought this mainly due to the limited ingredients and lack of fragrance. The deodorant has worked well in cooler weather, but today which is a warmer day in Arizona, it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well. I didn&#x27;t smell horrible, but I did notice some odor compared to the past. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this as it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin overmuch but I&#x27;ll use it in the relatively cooler spring, fall and winter.</li>
            <li> I finally found a natural deodorant that works!  It&#x27;s August in Florida and I only have to apply once, amazing!  And it comes in a cute little pot with your name on it, very boutiquish :)</li>
            <li> To be fair, I did not use this on a long-term basis, but I will offer my opinion based on when I did use it and on the product&#x27;s description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency in the jar was similar to a cold cream, and upon application, felt like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly appreciate how few ingredients this has and how it is touted as being safe and toxin-free, but another important question of course is how well does it deodorize? Compared to another natural deodorant I tried, I wasn&#x27;t sure this was as effective at neutralizing odor. I have to admit I also missed having a scent, though I know many will appreciate that it is unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is described as drying quickly to an imperceptible white haze, leaving no residue or stain on clothing. Unfortunately I have to be honest in saying I did notice the deodorant once applied, on at least a couple of occasions. Although it was not an obvious whitish color, I could actually see the separation line from where it was applied and the rest of the surrounding skin. It is always possible I used more than the recommended amount, but I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also mentioned that the shelf life is approx. one year if kept at room temperature with the lid secured tightly. What surprised me was that despite not having used this product a lot, when I opened it one day, it appeared to be disintegrating. The quantity was much less than I remembered being left - I knew I had not used that much - and it had only been a few months (was purchased in May 2013). I just opened the jar now, and the product is a bit hard, and has a very faint odor that reminds me a bit of chlorine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m really not sure what I think of this product. I suppose I wanted to like it more than I did. I have not continued using it and have since re-ordered a different brand.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural deodorant without all the chemicals in the regular ones.&lt;br /&gt;When I started using DeodoMon my armpit was kind of smelly (before I was using antiperspirant), but I noticed that this improved after a month or so. I guess my armpit got used to it and got mostly clean from the residuals of other deodorants. I like the product and and I am about to buy my second jar :-)&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I am not pregnant and I spend most of the time working on my computer. I work out with a hula hoop and also dancing (zumba).</li>
            <li> DeodoMom Cream deodorant is great for sensitive skin. It keeps you dry and odor free even after workouts.  If you have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts and itiching  this product is for you. I would highly recommend.  Have been using this for close to a year with no complaints.</li>
            <li> Does not work for me, I was still sweating and did not feel fresh! I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had problems with other aluminum free, all natural deodorants until I purchased this one. It lasts even through my trips to the gym and as a plus you can scent it with essential oils if you&#x27;d like (frankincense and myrrh are a great combo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> So being a guy I will say firsthand that the name alone had me being a bit apprehensive, but ultimately I gave it a shot and I am very surprised by how it has worked so far.  First, I&#x27;ll say that I do sweat and sometimes heavily even when sitting idle at my desk for periods of time.  I&#x27;ve been looking for alternatives to anti-perspirants (no more aluminum), but all seemed to really just trade one evil for another and have some level of hidden and potentially harmful ingredients.  I can&#x27;t remember how I stumbled onto this product and again I was very skeptical of it doing much for me.  Well, I&#x27;m now on week 3 and most of the time not only do I smell nothing at all from a long day at work or even after working out, I am somehow sweating significantly less than with my former anti-perspirant.  How this works so well I have no idea.  Given that it&#x27;s all in a simple and safe ingredient this has been a very big win for me.  I just hope that it continues to work and not lose effectiveness over time.</li>
            <li> There are so many great reviews,  I don&#x27;t want to be redundant, but suffice it to say that this stuff WORKS. How??? I don&#x27;t know. How did this little company figure out how to make something that so many are trying to do? I&#x27;ve tried so many brands - all the big ones you&#x27;ve probably tried too and then some homemade stuff, etc. Nothing worked. THIS DOES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different so this may not work for you, but it&#x27;s worth a shot. I&#x27;m glad I took it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I for one like the cream formula. I think it helps my underarms feel softer. They also look smoother and better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply thinly but cover the entire surface area. If you use too much it gets a bit of a white film, but just well... don&#x27;t use too much! You&#x27;ll figure out the right amount for you after a few days. Easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to use it through the summer months, but I have a feeling it will still work well or at least well enough! I&#x27;ll post an update it if fails me then. Somehow, I doubt it (I was stinky in the winter with the other natural brands and not at all with this, so that&#x27;s a lot of encouragement right there!)</li>
            <li> I would not recomend this even to my worst enemy. All I smelled was bad BO while using it. WOW...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for years for a product that did not smell like patchouli and kept me dry and fresh. Being a professional woman, I need to stay fresh all day. This product works, even during the summer on very stressful days. I highly recommend this product. Finally something that works!!</li>
            <li> All the deodorants / antiperspirants containing aluminum __________, or other alternatives just don’t work well on me, even when they do they make my body odor smell worse, even the fragrance free ones (interestingly the smell is worse with the products that contain fragrance!).&lt;br /&gt;Finally I found this product! Something that works really well, contains no fragrance or unnecessary additives, doesn’t leave a residue, and, even when I do sweat it is greatly reduced and it smells like sweat not some ultra foul odor multiplied by 10!&lt;br /&gt;YAY!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a natural deodorant that actually worked for me, but this one wasn&#x27;t it.  Just felt like I put lotion under my arms.  I tried it a few days in a row but it didn&#x27;t work on any of the days.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using antiperspirants with so many chemicals and would on occasions cause severe skin irritation. I was looking for a natural deodorant and found this. The reviews were all positives so i&#x27;d figure i&#x27;d give this a try. And I&#x27;m glad I did. This stuff is amazing! It does not cause me any irritation and it stops me from sweating even during the hot days of summer. I like it so much I have ordered another bottle. To be honest I do first apply some medicated powder for that extra protection when I work out. It ain&#x27;t cheap but it only has 2 ingredients and it does work.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to suffer that much and I won&#x27;t have to invest so much in magnesium hydroxide! It is a really good option and it really works for me, takes the odor and lets me sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so grateful for this product. I&#x27;ve lived many years feeling self conscious about the ineffective natural deodorants I was committed to sticking with, and then I found deodomom. Ohhh thank you Universe for allowing me to stumble upon this little life changing tub of goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect, it does leave some whiteness if you apply as thickly as I do, but I really don&#x27;t mind, it&#x27;s worth it. And yes sometimes the jar dries out a little (but really it&#x27;s not too hard to mix in a bit more water and let it sit overnight. Problem solved!). Someone very close to me mentioned that I haven&#x27;t had any funk at all since using this stuff. None! She said it was like a miracle :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re tired of being stinky but don&#x27;t want to resort to chemicals to deal with the issue. I&#x27;m a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a suitable alternative deodorant for years. Not only because of the toxic chemicals, but because after a month or two, they seem to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants claim to allow your body to perspire normally, and focus on covering up any odor. Which may works for some, but when I sweat, I STINK!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another consideration was the amount of perfumes in these &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants. More often than not, my underarms would become red and burn, or else dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the DeodoMom deodorant help me by decreasing my amount of perspiration. I don&#x27;t claim to know the science behind it. All I know is that my underarms are no longer sticky, and I don&#x27;t stink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s been over a month and it&#x27;s still going strong! I highly recommend you try this if you&#x27;re looking for an aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> When I saw that the product had only 2 ingredient and one of them was water. i was a little skeptical. But after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I received the product on a special Sunday delivery, one day before estimated delivery! And it works! I am very active and exercise usually once a day, and this product keeps me odor free. I love it.</li>
            <li> Who knew that something so simple could work so well. Love this stuff! It keeps me smell free and no rashes!</li>
            <li> DeodoMom really surprised me. I don&#x27;t understand how this stuff can be so effective at controlling odor. I mean, even after 24 hours nothing...no smell whatsoever. It&#x27;s about as mild on your skin as a product can be. I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have a very very sensitive skin and so does my spouse, this deoderant is effective and soft on your skin.</li>
            <li> I would really like to give this 5 stars as I have tried about 6 different deodorants and this one is by far the best.  I was using the Organic Island deodorant which was also wonderful but I developed a sensitivity to one of the ingredients and had to quit using it.  This works for about 12-18 hours for odor but you do sweat using it in high heat.  Sweat isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing since it can an antiperspirant can clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This jar only lasts me about 5 weeks but is worth every penny.  If it starts to get a little dry, just add a few drops of water and stir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a safe deodorant, give this one a try.  You cannot get much safer than the ingredient in this product!</li>
            <li> So amazed at how well this works! I&#x27;ve tried EVERY natural solution possible from powders to crystals to pastes and is is by far the BEST one. I teach yoga in sweaty Austin Texas (outdoors even!!) and I never ever have the slightest smell! So impressed with this. THANK YOU DEODOMOM!!</li>
            <li> I bought these since it says &amp;#34;hypoallergenic,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve had issues with regular deodorants lately. Most of them give me rashes. I thought this one would be an exception due to the excellent reviews, but it wasn&#x27;t. Within a couple hours after putting it on, I was itchy and my skin was red.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 5 days and so far so good. No mess...it manages to control odor for at least 24 hours. just tested it to see how long it would actually work for. Had to get this bc my doctor told me I was allergic to deodorants and they clog my pores. So I am trying it will give follow up.</li>
            <li> If you get used to applying it with your fingers instead of the standard roll-on or swipe on kind, it works really good at preventing perspiration naturally.  I actually don&#x27;t like scented deodorant - especially after it mixes with my own odor.  The jar even had my name and a date on it :)</li>
            <li> This is a miraculous product!  I have searched high and low for a natural, safe, deodorant that actually works.  I will never be using anything else ever again!</li>
            <li> This is literally the first and only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever purchased that WORKED. I&#x27;ve tried countless products to address my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; and this has been one of the most effective...takes a bit getting used to the application, but small price to pay. I love that it&#x27;s aluminum/fragrance/chemical-free, and the personalized packaging is a cute touch, too!!</li>
            <li> I only used this deodorant for about a month so I can&#x27;t talk about how well it works long term, but here&#x27;s my experience. When I first got this product, it was a nice creamy consistency, like lotion. After leaving it near the air vent for one night it hardened and became a weird, dryer consistency. It still worked but was harder to apply. It dried quickly when applied and never felt sticky, which was nice. Unfortunately, I felt the need to carry this deodorant with me because it usually wouldn&#x27;t last me through the day, something I never experienced with my old Dove antiperspirant. Also, during the first week of using it my pits had a really weird smell to them... I don&#x27;t know how to explain it but it was similar to pee (gross, I know). I figure that was just the toxins leaking out or something. It&#x27;s not there anymore. I also didn&#x27;t like that this was unscented, although I know that&#x27;s a plus for many people. I liked my old antiperspirant because it smelled lovely and perfumey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, this deodorant did work for me but I found myself having to reapply it, even without much sweating. It seems that it works wonders for other people so I would still recommend trying it if you&#x27;re looking for a natural, scentless deodorant.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a little over a month. The application is a little different, but I got used to it and feel it really does stand up to some hot sweaty days. Not perfect, but I have had a hard time finding an all natural deodorant that was.</li>
            <li> Inexplicably, after a month of use this turned rock hard despite being kept tightly shut in my 70 degree bathroom cabinet. Never again, Truly&#x27;s is much better.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> Words cannot explain the sheer joy this product has brought to my life! I struggle with a magnesium deficiency that causes a number of issues from anxiety, restless leg syndrome, headaches - and apparently body odor. I&#x27;ve tried every natural deodorant I could - homemade, store bought - nothing worked. I decided to give this stuff and try, and wow! I don&#x27;t even have a single stink after a long day of chasing three boys around. This may not work for everyone, but for me, well it was such a relief to not struggle with stink.  I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I have used deodorant without aluminum for quite a while.  However, some of the crystal types irritated my sensitive skin, so I tried this one.  I have used both the cream and the roll-on, and both are gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Really like that there are no chemicals/toxins and it&#x27;s safe to use while pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply and lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a few weeks now and so far it has been great!  It doesn&#x27;t bother my very sensitive skin, it has no odor and has left me completely b.o. free at the end of the day.  I have tried many natural deodorants and this is the only one that&lt;br /&gt;has completely eliminated any body odor.  It has been fairly hot where I live and additionally peri-menopause has left me more sweaty than usual, so the cream has passed the test with me.  I do wish it was offered in a glass jar though, less plastic in the world is better.</li>
            <li> This actually worked better than regular deodorants I had in the past, and I sweat a LOT bro. I have dry skin issues too so I usually have to put some olive oil on my underarms at night and a dab of perfume oils in the day for that extra girly magic, besides that nothing extra, this stuff is perfect for the toughest athletes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the crystal deodorant, among others typically found at health food stores. This seems to work the best and is safe. I&#x27;ve been using the cream for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> Possibly the best deodorant ever! I absolutely love it and it works without harming me with toxic ingredients. It is easy to use, convenient, lasts a long time, safe, and by all means effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used to use deodorant despite being a rigorous dancer (basically I never had to go through a so-called detoxifying period)- this wasn&#x27;t *too* much of a problem, but there were definitely times where I thought deodorant might be a good idea. I went on the search for all natural deodorant recipes and all natural commercial deodorants. Unfortunately, most of them contained baking soda and I wasn&#x27;t comfortable using those. While baking soda might be a huge step above the aluminum based deodorants, it is a very powerful substance that can cause irritation and over-abrasion in many people. It has a very high pH and is not always suitable for sensitive skin, especially when using it in a way which keeps it in contact with the skin for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried an alum deodorant but that didn&#x27;t work either- plus, there is controversy surrounding alum as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I came across this product and was skeptical- the substance seemed mild and safe, it had only 2 ingredients, it didn&#x27;t leave too many marks, and it had good reviews. Was it too good to be true? Well boy am I glad that I purchased this product because it truly was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my 2 cents/tips for this product:&lt;br /&gt;-I need only a little bit (a half pea sized amount) per underarm each morning and it lasts me through the day- too much and it may leave a little bit of white residue on your underarms. You may want to experiment yourself and figure out which amount is best for you.&lt;br /&gt;-This isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, but it&#x27;s a powerful deodorant and has worked for me immediately in removing musk even if I put it later on in the day and don&#x27;t wash up before applying.&lt;br /&gt;-I like to apply a little arrowroot powder on my armpits, as I think that helps with delaying sweating a bit.&lt;br /&gt;-Some people have reported the mixture drying up a bit, but mixing a little water in helps in loosening, \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot;, and softening the mixture without it losing its potency. I think the tendency of milk of magnesia (what this deodorant is made of) is to dry up, so don&#x27;t be afraid if you see it drying! It&#x27;s completely natural and can be fixed by adding a little water and then mixing well.&lt;br /&gt;-Because milk of magnesia is high in pH, it may be a good idea to mix a soothing mixture with a lower pH (possibly with lemon juice) to dab on your underarms each night for some time. This could be a lemon juice mixture diluted with water, rosewater, or aloe vera which you dab on and keep for a long time, a honey+lemon juice mixture which you apply in the shower and wash off, etc. This is just an idea which I haven&#x27;t experimented greatly with yet, so please do feel free to take whatever approach you want (it isn&#x27;t necessary to do this). In addition, you want to be careful with your mixture not being too acidic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this product and am hooked. I am a dancer and when I first tried the deodorant, I was dancing for 6 hours straight in an intensive. Magically, my underarms didn&#x27;t smell musky and I was amazed. It has continued to work just as well since then. Hope you give it a try!</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work. I gave it over a week of non aluminum deodorant detox trial period.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t reek as much as I might if I hadn&#x27;t used this, but my pits still smell like pits. Noticeably so. Enough to make me self conscious.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s alright for wearing after a shower and going straight to bed...the only time I didn&#x27;t smell my underarm b.o. I need a non aluminum deo just for that so I&#x27;ll finish this jar but no more after that.&lt;br /&gt;PS Wash/wipe this stuff off before applying normal deo bc your underarms will burn like they are on FIRE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so very disappointed in this. I&#x27;m not a stinky person. My boyfriend has no bo and never needs deo--ever. Lucky mofo!!!!!! But he always tells me I smell good not gross when I go the natural route. I, however, cannot relax when in the company of my own smelly arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try trulys next. It can&#x27;t burn more than the deo combo accident I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try this as an oil control makeup primer since many ladies claim milk of magnesia is a wonderful super oily face mattifier. It would be a much cheaper solution than the high end brand of mattifier I use now. And more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More of a 1.5 star rating. :( sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I keep my jar in a ziploc bag and suck out the air before sealing so it doesn&#x27;t dry out as fast.</li>
            <li> I love this! The first time I ordered it, it was cracked and spilled all over the package. I told them and they immediately sent me a new one for free :) I have tried it now, and it is AMAZING! It actually works. I sweat easily, so I reapply it a couple of times in between showers if I have worked out or been very active. It works better than my store bought, aluminum deodorant! When I am sweaty and reapply/use &#x27;regular&#x27; deodorant, it leaves a weird odor on my clothes, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I bought the DeodoMom cream and love it! I have been using it for almost 2 months now and have absolutely zero complaints. I have tried other natural odor solutions (Soapwalla) that left me with painful red rashes under my arm pits after two weeks of use and others not even eliminating odor (Tom&#x27;s). DeodoMom is great because it truly does leaves me odor free. When I shower my under arms are free from any residue that my old deodorants would leave. I have also had no problems with it leaving marks on my clothes after I apply and then get dressed. The cream dries fast and can even be applied directly after shaving. I have tried everything natural when it comes to deodorant and have found nothing that compares to DeodoMom.&lt;br /&gt;I love knowing that I can be odor free without risking my health for the sake of hygiene.p</li>
            <li> I tend to have very delicate underarms and have been searching for a deoderant that will not irritate them.  It seems as though I have tried all the brand name hypo-allergenic deoderants and the crystal deoderants, and they all irritate my skin.  So I thought I would give the DeodoMom a try.  So far so good.  I live in Florida and it is hot!  I still perspire but the DeodoMom eliminates embarrassing odor.  My underarms have been much less irritated since I started using it.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many, many of the non-toxic fragrance-free deodorants out there, at every cost point. Most did nothing. A few made some small difference but they irritated my skin. So I ordered this with extreme skepticism. (But you can&#x27;t just give up, right?). This stuff is amazing, even when I have to skip a shower. The cream is very easy and not messy/no waiting for it to dry like roll-ons. You just need a tiny amount and it takes about 3 seconds to rub it in. Now I just hope they keep making it forever!</li>
