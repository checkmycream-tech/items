            <li>I love Keratase products as a whole and this one in particular.  </li>

            <li>Very well packed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive but it does the best for my hair</li>
            <li>Handlind was uncomplicated and fast!</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
            <li>too much work</li>
            <li>and really it didn&#x27;t help would not order it again.  </li>
            <li>The Kerastase Masque is a great product for thin and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing but</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loyal to Kerastase products for a while and have noticed that my hair is much more healthy, even if lately I have been pretty bad about getting frequent haircuts (have not been able to do it more than twice/ year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it at least once a week to keep my healthy hair!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order Nutri-Thermique again and most enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who styles with a blow dryer and/or a flat iron.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps keep it soft and is unlike anything else I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Switched to the green bottles and they are much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pricey conditioners, but this is the only one worth it.</li>
            <li>Always leaves my dry gross hair incredibly soft, shiny, and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have used this conditioner for years and it leaves my hair hydrated, soft and silky even though my hair is highly processed.  </li>
            <li>Not only does my hair blow dry easily</li>
            <li>And I have gorgeous long thick</li>
            <li>joico, biolage and spent a great deal of money and nothing seemed to make a difference, maybe they even made my hair worse.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It washed out thoroughly and left my hair very manageable.  </li>
            <li>If ur wanting to save money you really don&#x27;t need the regular conditioner just definetley the mask!!!!</li>
            <li>Makes hair really soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Just fair, not impressed with this product</li>
            <li>These are great results for someone who has always been plagued with dry, ultra thick, coarse, curly hair and is a slave to both a blow dryer and flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I leave a small amount  of the conditioner in my hair when rinsing &amp; it leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>What a waste... Be aware of the quality!</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry curly hair which I highlight it blonde and blow dry it straight often both only adds to the dryness-</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, blonde hair and this does not weigh it down or make it flat/limp.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that I love this line of product, I was pretty disappointed by this Particular hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for amazon , infact this is the first one ever!</li>
            <li>I have bleached blonde hair (my natural color is almost black and my chosen color is a light-honey blonde so that should tell you how much processing my hair is subjected to) and this is the only conditioner besides &amp;#34;Aussie 3 Minute Miracle&amp;#34; that I will use on my hair.</li>
            <li>Apply, comb through, wrap hair in plastic and sit in the sun or blow dry or sit under an old hood hairdryer.</li>
            <li>hair is thin and fine</li>

            <li> hair is thin and fine</li>
            <li> I found this one to be a little heavy for my super thick, super long hair though.</li>
            <li> Goes a long  way.  </li>
            <li> Masque came earlier than it was expected.</li>
            <li> Despite the initial mistake due to the courtesy and promptness of the store, I received the product as required</li>
            <li> I only shampoo my hair 1-2x per week and the other days I just rinse and condition.</li>
            <li> Since I had my baby, my hair became extremely dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking around for ages for something to fix the dry brittle ends</li>
            <li> so my hair was really dry.</li>
            <li> I used to wash it every single day because I exercise every morning.</li>
            <li> I got it before the expected time</li>
            <li> I would not have spent $50.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I expected to see a difference in my hair after using this.  </li>
            <li> It smells, and has an awful chemical aroma, but the key to success with this conditioner is to get the water as hot as you can get it, to rinse it out.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> never happened with any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> It has Keratase beaten hands down.  </li>
            <li> I put a shower cap and heated with a blow drier for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> the past few months my hair has been so damaged it wouldn&#x27;t even curl</li>
            <li> I bought a huge jar of this for a ridiculous price, about $100, and was sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You need just a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d purchase it again, despite its creamy texture.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the container, though, because it is badly designed and I dropped almost a third of the product.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for thin hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I wish amazon allowed to to add photos because the difference in my hair is almost unbelievable !</li>
            <li> It seems very expensive but it lasts enough, you do not need to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is not really &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34; and in bad shape, I do use heated styling tools and I color my hair.  </li>
            <li> But my hair became thin and lifeless, not shiny anymore</li>
            <li> Kerastase is expensive</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, pricy, whatever you want to call it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very expensive.</li>
            <li> Its getting as bad as Ebay!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Overpriced and overrated. Too heavy for thin hair like mine. 2 h after washing my hair, they looked like I didn&#x27;t wash them for a week.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It leaves my hair very soft and smells great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it did not come with instructions.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about any KÃ©rastase product?  They have formulas for any hair type and address any hair issue.  This is no exception.  The masque is rich and beautifully scented and left my hair soft and manageable. These are great results for someone who has always been plagued with dry, ultra thick, coarse, curly hair and is a slave to both a blow dryer and flat iron.  I will definitely order Nutri-Thermique again and most enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who styles with a blow dryer and/or a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Always leaves my dry gross hair incredibly soft, shiny, and healthy. It smells, and has an awful chemical aroma, but the key to success with this conditioner is to get the water as hot as you can get it, to rinse it out. It&#x27;s great, I&#x27;ve used Wen, paul mitchell, biolage, this is one of the best!!!!</li>
            <li> Almost sure it&#x27;s not the realt thing. Even the packaging was sketchy and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair the way salon bought kerastase products do.</li>
            <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon. Great product for over treated hair. I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
            <li> Love it and such a good deal! AAA+++ transaction!!</li>
            <li> Best. Conditioner. Ever.</li>
            <li> Got this order quickly and I love this conditioner! It makes my hair so soft and shiny. Smells great to.</li>
            <li> Expedite delivery and products meet the expectation</li>
            <li> Excellent Product Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li> The best I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts the best masque for hair. I love Kerastase. The poducts are excellent!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! It&#x27;s like a miracle! Seller did great I got it before the expected time</li>
            <li> Fabulous conditioner.  Good price. Goes a long  way.  Apply, comb through, wrap hair in plastic and sit in the sun or blow dry or sit under an old hood hairdryer. ( i had one in the attic) hair is strengthened and nourished!</li>
            <li> Kerastase is the best shampoo or conditioner. I found this one to be a little heavy for my super thick, super long hair though. Switched to the green bottles and they are much better. But still really liked this one.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected. Very disappointed. I have very dry, overly processed hair and had heard this was an excellent product. I would not recommend it. It&#x27;s also very expensive.</li>
            <li> Since I had my baby, my hair became extremely dry and unmanageable. I&#x27;ve tried all products.. joico, biolage and spent a great deal of money and nothing seemed to make a difference, maybe they even made my hair worse. Kerastase is expensive so I bought the 2.55 ounces (75 ml( package ($18 at kerastase.com) so I could try and if I didnt like it I would not have spent $50. I got it in the mail today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try! I left the product in my hair for 10 minutes. I put a shower cap and heated with a blow drier for a few minutes. Oh Boy! What a difference!! I&#x27;m so so so excited :)))). I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for amazon , infact this is the first one ever! I don&#x27;t know how I survived without this product . I have pretty dry curly hair which I highlight it blonde and blow dry it straight often both only adds to the dryness- the past few months my hair has been so damaged it wouldn&#x27;t even curl I didn&#x27;t know what to do so I bought this product and I am so glad I did ! I wish amazon allowed to to add photos because the difference in my hair is almost unbelievable ! Not only does my hair blow dry easily but it also curls beautifully again. I am so happy with this product that I am going to stock up!  I&#x27;ve been looking around for ages for something to fix the dry brittle ends and this is it ! Some of the reviews mention the strong powder smell... Small price to pay for amazing hair :)</li>
            <li> works well and love the smell!!!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, pricy, whatever you want to call it. But it works wonders in your hair. I used to wash it every single day because I exercise every morning. But my hair became thin and lifeless, not shiny anymore no matter what product I used. This Kerastasse mask has brought it back to life. You need just a small amount. It seems very expensive but it lasts enough, you do not need to use a lot of it. Be careful with the container, though, because it is badly designed and I dropped almost a third of the product. Really good treatment for your hair, get it, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner it has restored my hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin and fine and I was worried that this product would be too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;It washed out thoroughly and left my hair very manageable.  My ends are in tact which&lt;br /&gt;has never happened with any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that I love this line of product, I was pretty disappointed by this Particular hair conditioner. It stunk as if it had been sitting around for quite sometime, and it was lumpy and somewhat discolored. I&#x27;ve used the hair conditioner before and never felt or smell that way. I had thrown out the box and the return tag, so I couldn&#x27;t send the item back; I just threw it in the garbage. What a waste... Be aware of the quality!</li>
            <li> too much work and really it didn&#x27;t help would not order it again.  I wish I didn&#x27;t have to use x amount of words for this survey</li>
            <li> I truly love this product, it leaves my hair super soft and shiny.  I will buy again!</li>
            <li> my favorite for about 5 years now. And I have gorgeous long thick hi lighted hair :) worth the money</li>
            <li> I use this on occasion &amp; while it will never replace my L&#x27;Oreal force vector mask, it is very good &amp; the smell is amazing!  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d purchase it again, despite its creamy texture. It didn&#x27;t seem over the top moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The Kerastase Masque is a great product for thin and damaged hair. It&#x27;s the a very good conditioner and one of the best that Kerastase makes. I use it at least once a week to keep my healthy hair!</li>
            <li> Very good masque! Perfect! Smell really good! Very well packed! Arrived on time. This is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li> My hair is 90 percent gray and I get it colored every four weeks.  it feels like straw unless I use this conditioner.  I&#x27;ve tried everything.  It&#x27;s expensive but it does the best for my hair so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Masque came earlier than it was expected. The masque was sealed in original packaging. Im very satisfied with this order.</li>
            <li> Just fair, not impressed with this product</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner for years and it leaves my hair hydrated, soft and silky even though my hair is highly processed.  I wouldn&#x27;t use any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loyal to Kerastase products for a while and have noticed that my hair is much more healthy, even if lately I have been pretty bad about getting frequent haircuts (have not been able to do it more than twice/ year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price with this vendor was excellent! And it was delivered promptly in perfect conditions, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I leave a small amount  of the conditioner in my hair when rinsing &amp; it leaves my hair silky smooth. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!my hair has been died blond, blowed dry, and straighten sooo much! I got this product bc my friend is a stylist and she said,\\&quot;kerastase makes blondes bounce back\\&quot; my hair has never been better!!! And continues with each use , I also got the shampoo and regular conditioner, and just ordered the heat protectant!! If ur wanting to save money you really don&#x27;t need the regular conditioner just definetley the mask!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Kerastase products and totally satisfied with it! Handlind was uncomplicated and fast! Would order again!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing but the scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> I have bleached blonde hair (my natural color is almost black and my chosen color is a light-honey blonde so that should tell you how much processing my hair is subjected to) and this is the only conditioner besides &amp;#34;Aussie 3 Minute Miracle&amp;#34; that I will use on my hair. It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pricey conditioners, but this is the only one worth it. Bumble &amp; Bumble, doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> The product is great, leaves hair very soft and shiny after having applied it in the scalp of the hair</li>
            <li> Despite the initial mistake due to the courtesy and promptness of the store, I received the product as required</li>
            <li> All Kerastase products are great.  Makes hair really soft and silky.  And a little goes a long way.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Kerastase about 2 years ago now. I started with the conditioner, got Kerastase shampoo, and then bought this. I only shampoo my hair 1-2x per week and the other days I just rinse and condition. I use this mask only on days I shampoo. I rinse with really hot water and then use my usual styling products. I have long, fine, blonde hair and this does not weigh it down or make it flat/limp. It&#x27;s just shiney and healthy. Kerastase is totally worth the money, buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This is nothing special.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I bought a huge jar of this for a ridiculous price, about $100, and was sorely disappointed.  Although my hair is not really &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34; and in bad shape, I do use heated styling tools and I color my hair.  I expected to see a difference in my hair after using this.  I saw no improvement or change whatsoever.  It&#x27;s all hype.  I&#x27;ve found a wonderful deep conditioner, Kanechom (from Brazil), that&#x27;s all over YouTube and it really works.  It&#x27;s also really cheap.  It comes in a huge container for about 10 bucks.  Fantastic.  It has Keratase beaten hands down.  My hair was much more flexible and shiny after using it.  I applied it and sat under a heat cap for an hour and then rinsed.  The results were marvelous.  And of course, Brazilians have beautiful hair so they would know.  Do yourself a favor and skip the Keratase and all the magazine hype.  Try Kanechom.  It works.  And it smells like a garden too.  I definitely do not recommend Keratase at all.</li>
            <li> I love Keratase products as a whole and this one in particular.  However, when it arrived it had been leaking and the consistency of the product wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m used to.  I suspect it might be counterfeit (?) because it is gloppy and watery.  I wish Amazon would get better about oversight on its sellers.  Its getting as bad as Ebay!  At any rate, I&#x27;m working with the seller to see about a refund...we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Love this product and company sent it very promptly!</li>
            <li> Pretty pricey but absolutely amazing stuff. I have coarse, wavy hair. I often straighten my hair and I swim a lot so my hair was really dry. This stuff really helps keep it soft and is unlike anything else I have ever used. Worth the price if you can afford it! :)</li>
            <li> great product - arrived so fast! this stuff is excellent for my hair - i love it!! i would recommend this to anyone that wants beautiful hair.</li>
