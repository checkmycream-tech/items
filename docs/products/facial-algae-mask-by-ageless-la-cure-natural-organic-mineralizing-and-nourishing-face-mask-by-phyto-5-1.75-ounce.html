    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>the evening, the skin where I&#x27;d applied the algae mask was wonderfully moist and young-looking.</li>
            <li>Perfect hydrating mask!  </li>
            <li>best results, apply twice a week, or as needed, until product is finished.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finished results are excellent - skin texture is tangibly smoother and softer with a nice, hydrated appearance.</li>
            <li>Great for on-camera work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I saw the opportunity to try this out, I was quite happy to do so.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt really great</li>
            <li>It doesn’t have a great smell, but it’s not horrid either.  </li>
            <li>I’m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>Also, the fragrance of the product is pleasant.</li>
            <li>All of the Phyto 5 products are good, and  are in pro-make-up</li>
            <li>At the price it&#x27;s listed for now, it&#x27;s a good value.  </li>
            <li>This way I can do a good face wash in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But anything that will help the skin look healthy, I welcome.</li>
            <li>a bit of every day luxury that works the 1st time, and gets better!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most attractive color--a kind of yellowish brown--but it feels really nice.</li>
            <li>Now, for all I know this product is exceptional in what it does, but I have to experience it more exceptionally for that price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the ones I&#x27;ve tried and found them to be eminently suitable for their intended purpose.  </li>
            <li>This is NOT that kind of mask.</li>
            <li>(I received this from the Vine program in exchange for an honest review), I would have balked a bit at the price for just 1.75 ounces.</li>
            <li>it did come out, I liked the way it felt.  </li>
            <li>the product&#x27;s scent isn&#x27;t nice.</li>
            <li>I kind of like the tightening/hardening effect of masks</li>
            <li>light tan masque goes on smoothly and the the results when wash away are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It’s quite a nice product.  </li>
            <li>This does not tighten as it dries, which feels nice.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time.have wrinkles or lines (</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time.</li>
            <li>The mask did not come out of the container very easily and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>However, as I always write, I&#x27;d love it if more products added a citrus or spicy scent to their products!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in my mid-40s, with fair skin and light eyes.)  </li>
            <li>This is all good, assuming it&#x27;s all true (and I have no reason to doubt that it could be).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mask feels very smooth going on.</li>
            <li>As many others have already noted, there are no instructions.  </li>
            <li>tried this product both before and after my morning shower, and &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; was better for me since it rinsed off thoroughly,</li>
            <li>Almost smells &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; but I also know that many organic products don&#x27;t use scent.</li>
            <li>A sponge or washcloth may work better, as it took a while to wash away the mask -</li>
            <li>This is significantly better.</li>
            <li>and there so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was for me or not because it says for dehydrated skin or skin lacking minerals.</li>
            <li>My wife used this The Phyto5 mousse d’algues and found it to be an excellent facial mousse.  </li>
            <li>and I was worried that this mask might also make my skin redder and more prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Although lemon is not one of my favorite scents, the verbena does cover the smell of the algae in this product.</li>
            <li>More like a citrus smell.</li>
            <li>The dispenser works great, it feels nice on the skin (not dry and cakey), has a nice mild smell, and washes off well with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>but I find it best to gently rinse your face over the sink followed by a gentle pat clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the result that it left my face feeling smooth and wonderfully re-hydrated&lt;</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and it definitely has a glow, but best of all my face feels so clean after I use this.</li>
            <li>Like Aveda does, for an example--their products smell amazing and it gives products a pampering fun &amp;#34;spa-like&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes my skin felt great, soft and hydrated without being greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>It is a soft mixture and makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li>I like masks and fun products to make my skin feel nice</li>
            <li>The paste is released in drop sized amounts through a pump dispenser and absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply...</li>
            <li>They really need to enclose the container in a nice box with instructions and more information.  </li>
            <li>It’s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>on it&#x27;s own, you look better, and a bit younger- perfect for guys going to a reunion or social event.  </li>
            <li>It’s light and almost feathery; in fact, in the 10 minutes of recommended time that it was on, it was easy to forget I even had a mask</li>
            <li>product experience is fine.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing and nice, but not too  girly, so hubby can enjoy pampering his skin as well.  </li>
            <li>For one thing, it goes on smoothly and lightly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light yet sturdy and does not have any abrasives that I could</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your face feel smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>For best results use a quality facial serum followed by application of moisturizer to really reap the benefits that this mask provides.</li>
            <li>My skin feels better moisturized immediately after use, about the same as using a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a nice product that I will enjoy the rest of the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t purchase this particular brand.</li>
            <li>in all, I just expected more and better, ie, a pump that dispenses more smoothly, and a mask that produces more hydration and not a bunch of bumps.  </li>
            <li>Its more of a normal mud masque for lack of a better description.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know the Phyto 5  brand and was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>When it comes to facial masks I have always loved the outcome and clarifying effects of a fine quality clay mask on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to gently exfoliate, deliver antioxidant protection, visibly brighten, smooth and hydrate your skin, leaving a refreshing glow.  </li>
            <li>nothing special, but did the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t do anything special for me, it smells funky while on (a recommended 10 minutes)</li>
            <li>After drying, my face did feel smooth - though really, not to the point where I was especially excited about it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I left it on for the recommended 10 minutes and it worked great.</li>
            <li>The pumping mechanism does not evenly distribute the mask and I wasn’t quite sure how much of it to use.  </li>
            <li>pump container is very efficient, allowing you to dispense just the amount you want without ever touching or contaminating the product inside.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed and can see myself doing this at least once a week, though they do recommend on the amazon site 2x per week is recommended.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, my skin was a bit lighter and brighter and drier, though I did develop a red bump on my forehead at one point (which could be good if the mask is drawing out impurities, I suppose, or perhaps that wasn&#x27;t the fault of the mask).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t feel more softness or much tone improvement.</li>
            <li>There are no instructions on the bottle (one reason this doesn&#x27;t get a full five stars), but the instructions are on the Amazon page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does wash off easily.&lt;br /&gt;The use of almost all natural ingredients and some organic ingredients is a nice change.</li>
            <li>It seems like a pretty easy way to enhance your skin.</li>
            <li>scent is nice, too, subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a while to pump and then sometimes comes out too quickly</li>
            <li>In general, I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars for that - if you are going to charge me $26 for a little over an ounce of product, please make it exceptional!</li>
            <li>If with continued use, I see something amazing, I&#x27;ll come back and note it.</li>
            <li>There are many positives about Ageless La Cure Natural Face Mask by Phyto.  </li>
            <li>but then my skin absorbed it&lt;</li>
            <li>This is a really nice facial mask.</li>
            <li>I believe the price may be worth adding this to my cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li>My face where I&#x27;d applied the clay was clean, but the skin appeared slightly more coarse and dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>point is good in my opinion unlike other reviewers if applied sparingly&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no flaky, itchy or sticky aftermath; rather, my skin felt tightened and hydrated right away.</li>
            <li>I was right.  </li>
            <li>product felt fine going on, and I liked the slight lemon verbena smell which offset the mud/mineral odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a very earthy, muddy smell that is on the strong side, and doesn&#x27;t dissipate all that much as the mask dries.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li>: It is very gentle, with the scent not that overpowering.</li>
            <li>My skin experienced no sensitivity or redness, as is sometimes common with masks.</li>
            <li>I liked the write-up on this company, so I was curious to try an algae-based product.</li>
            <li>this point, the algae mask has taken over from clay as my favorite facial beauty</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was the scent smelled like lemons but not quite</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this and think I actually would splurge and buy this after this runs out.  </li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I kept waiting for it to harden.</li>
            <li>unannounced)&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li>First of all, you need to read the information on Amazon to even know how you’re supposed to use it.  </li>
            <li>I have used Phyto hair products for years but this is the first face product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is a great for dry skin, and I hope to see future benefits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and it leaves my face super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>And it will make your skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>The Phyto 5 Ageless La Cure Organic Algae Mousse mask left my face feeling smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Overall, absolutely loved the product and would definitely look to purchase it and recommend to friends!</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t notice any real difference in my complexion (50-ish skin, fair, average amount of fine wrinkles and age spots, tends to be dry</li>
            <li>Because I have acne prone skin, I still used my Clean and Clear Dual Action moisturizer which is a very light moisturizer (to me anyway) and didn&#x27;t have to use anything else prior to applying my foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I did feel my skin  looked more even due to the dry patches improving and for sure</li>
            <li>but I did feel my skin  looked more even due to the dry patches improving and for sure</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to long-term benefits, but the mask certainly left my face feeling smooth and well hydrated.  </li>
            <li>The results aren&#x27;t all that noticeable, though, and I expected more from a product at this price point.  </li>
            <li>I found the skin to be rejuvenated, and ready for HD make-up, as their is a lifting component.</li>
            <li>the brightening effect could very well be the product doing its job.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt lightly moisturized after and the next morning.  </li>
            <li>It’s very “greasy”.  </li>
            <li>and you can’t really see it at all.  </li>
            <li>It did not seem to do much in the way of moisterizing.</li>
            <li>She feels that the price of the mask is a reasonable one.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>Appropriate for all skin types this facial mask (soft paste) provides a sumptuous finish with all the benefits of exfoliation, hydration and antioxidant skin restoratives.</li>
            <li>, I noticed my dry patches are much better and this doesn&#x27;t stimulate more oil production that I&#x27;ve experienced with most other mask products I&#x27;ve tried in the past which would leave my face super shiny by the afternoon and made my makeup feel gloppy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>The other two were okay--</li>
            <li>Hands down, the Phyto 5 Mask did a better job of refining my pores and exfoliating the skin.</li>
            <li>After the 10 minutes were up, the mask was easy to remove with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li>This left my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Many were much more expensive than this product.  </li>
            <li>But in researching the ingredients, they are all highly touted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I just wish the price weren&#x27;t as high for the amount given.</li>
            <li>A little more than a year ago, I started using a pumpkin peel from Skin Obsession every two weeks.</li>
            <li>Though this product is certified organic, there is something in it with which my skin really doesn&#x27;t agree, so anyone who has sensitive skin should probably use this with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mask actually is not too thick and goes on smoothly, it does not get too dry on your face, which is good.  </li>
            <li>This came at just the right time.&lt;br /&gt;Summer and city make for a hard climate for one&#x27;s skin and this easily applied mousse</li>
            <li>It was easy to get it out by just pushing it down with one finger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel overly tight when dry, and washes off easily with a warm, wet washcloth.</li>
            <li>The pump dispenser is handy, but be careful not to &amp;#34;overpump,&amp;#34; as a smaller amount is necessary than you might think.  </li>
            <li>It softens better than my usual routine, didn&#x27;t cause any distress or breakouts of my skin</li>
            <li>It softens better than my usual routine, didn&#x27;t cause any distress or breakouts of my skin</li>
            <li>My skin felt smoother than usual and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The Ageless Algae Mask went on smoothly, and as it was not clear from the limited instructions about how much to apply, I went liberally.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d give it 3 stars for price for amount of product provided, that my face didn&#x27;t feel especially different afterward, and the &amp;#34;scent;&amp;#34; 3.5 stars for how it made my facial skin seem to look right after rinsing; 4 stars for how it feels if you rub a bit into your skin and don&#x27;t wash it away!)  </li>
            <li>I smoothed on a light cover of mask, which means this container will last a long time.</li>
            <li>In fact, the only ingredients listed are Algae, Vitamin E, Glycerin, Organic Verbena Flower Water, Organic Sweet Almond Oil and Aquaxyl, the latter described as hyaluronic acid booster which optimizes the circulation of water throughout the layers of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many masks leave my skin feeling irritated, and some have even left a slight burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>Removing the mask is easy and only requires the use of a wet washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All the ingredients listed on the bottle, labeled under INCI guidelines (International Nomenclature for Cosmetic Ingredients), are organic and sounded absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once applied, it doesn&#x27;t burn or pull, and there is only a very minuscule sensation of tightening.  </li>
            <li>and my skin did feel soft</li>
            <li>This looks like it would be like the old clay masks we all have used before.</li>
            <li>At nearly $50 for this bottle, it&#x27;s rather steep.  </li>
            <li>Ageless La Cure Natural  Organic Algae Mousse Face Mask by</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also certified organic and 98.9% of the ingredients are of natural origin.  </li>
            <li>My adult daughter (who lives with me) used this mask twice a week for a month.</li>
            <li>I am worried that she will cause damage to her skin with such make-up so we look for cleansing agents that are gentle and may help her skin over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d purchase this particular mask when there are so many more much less expensive products out there.</li>
            <li>I expected a greenish kind of color, not sure why, but in my head that is what I thought</li>
            <li>/&gt;To truly test the results for myself, I decided to apply my favorite clay mask to one half of my face and neck, and Phyto 5 algae on the other.</li>
            <li>used to clay masks that dry to a hardened shell and in the interim, make me look like I’m getting ready for Halloween.  </li>
            <li>And as for cost effectiveness, I would just as soon use an inexpensive exfoliant to clean my pores, followed by my usual rosehips seed oil to moisturize.  </li>
            <li>First, I have to say that the manufacturers choosing not to have printed instructions on the product was an odd choice to make, in that it forces people to come to sites like Amazon in order to find out how much to apply, how long to leave the product on, etc.  </li>
            <li>The key ingredients with this product are micro and macro algae along with sweet almond oil, Aquaxyl and other essential marine minerals.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey -- but then, we&#x27;re worth it, aren&#x27;t we ladies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t harden like some facial masks, either, but instead stayed soft.</li>
            <li>this is the only one so far that seems to fulfill that promise.</li>
            <li>Massage gently with wet hands.</li>
            <li>The key ingredients – algae, sweet almond oil and the hydrating compound Aquaxyl promise antioxidant protection and I am unschooled about whether it does or not.  </li>
            <li>this product with other items, like vitamins, and other light facial cleansers and moisturizers should help your skin become healthier and healthier looking.</li>
            <li>made my skin feel soft, but I didn&#x27;t notice enough of a difference that it would become a regular part of my routine.</li>
            <li>, it comes out a really not very attractive color kind of a yellow&#x27;y&#x27; brown color.  </li>
            <li>The pump-action for the first use takes a little bit of doing to get the product out of the bottle, but after that first-time use, there is no problem pumping out the product.  </li>
            <li>It’s not cheap, but the price has fallen since it was first listed.  </li>
            <li>There was a slight tingle on my skin that lasted a moment or two, somewhat like a niacin flush, but gentle.</li>
            <li>This product would likely work well for people who have normal skin, but for me, it&#x27;s been mostly disappointing and has caused more issues than it&#x27;s solved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I need so little and only use it twice a week (as per recommended), this container should last me probably at least 6 weeks and maybe even as much as 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it the second time, I didn&#x27;t bother trying to moisturize my dry patches because they were pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>Usually I apply a moisturizing lotion to the dry patches but try to avoid the rest of my face because later in the day, it makes my skin look super shiny.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> the evening, the skin where I&#x27;d applied the algae mask was wonderfully moist and young-looking.</li>
            <li> Perfect hydrating mask!  </li>
            <li> best results, apply twice a week, or as needed, until product is finished.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finished results are excellent - skin texture is tangibly smoother and softer with a nice, hydrated appearance.</li>
            <li> Great for on-camera work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I saw the opportunity to try this out, I was quite happy to do so.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt really great</li>
            <li> It doesn’t have a great smell, but it’s not horrid either.  </li>
            <li> I’m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> Also, the fragrance of the product is pleasant.</li>
            <li> All of the Phyto 5 products are good, and  are in pro-make-up</li>
            <li> At the price it&#x27;s listed for now, it&#x27;s a good value.  </li>
            <li> This way I can do a good face wash in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But anything that will help the skin look healthy, I welcome.</li>
            <li> a bit of every day luxury that works the 1st time, and gets better!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most attractive color--a kind of yellowish brown--but it feels really nice.</li>
            <li> Now, for all I know this product is exceptional in what it does, but I have to experience it more exceptionally for that price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the ones I&#x27;ve tried and found them to be eminently suitable for their intended purpose.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT that kind of mask.</li>
            <li> (I received this from the Vine program in exchange for an honest review), I would have balked a bit at the price for just 1.75 ounces.</li>
            <li> it did come out, I liked the way it felt.  </li>
            <li> the product&#x27;s scent isn&#x27;t nice.</li>
            <li> I kind of like the tightening/hardening effect of masks</li>
            <li> light tan masque goes on smoothly and the the results when wash away are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It’s quite a nice product.  </li>
            <li> This does not tighten as it dries, which feels nice.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time.have wrinkles or lines (</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time.</li>
            <li> The mask did not come out of the container very easily and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> However, as I always write, I&#x27;d love it if more products added a citrus or spicy scent to their products!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my mid-40s, with fair skin and light eyes.)  </li>
            <li> This is all good, assuming it&#x27;s all true (and I have no reason to doubt that it could be).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mask feels very smooth going on.</li>
            <li> As many others have already noted, there are no instructions.  </li>
            <li> tried this product both before and after my morning shower, and &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; was better for me since it rinsed off thoroughly,</li>
            <li> Almost smells &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; but I also know that many organic products don&#x27;t use scent.</li>
            <li> A sponge or washcloth may work better, as it took a while to wash away the mask -</li>
            <li> This is significantly better.</li>
            <li> and there so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was for me or not because it says for dehydrated skin or skin lacking minerals.</li>
            <li> My wife used this The Phyto5 mousse d’algues and found it to be an excellent facial mousse.  </li>
            <li> and I was worried that this mask might also make my skin redder and more prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Although lemon is not one of my favorite scents, the verbena does cover the smell of the algae in this product.</li>
            <li> More like a citrus smell.</li>
            <li> The dispenser works great, it feels nice on the skin (not dry and cakey), has a nice mild smell, and washes off well with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> but I find it best to gently rinse your face over the sink followed by a gentle pat clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the result that it left my face feeling smooth and wonderfully re-hydrated&lt;</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and it definitely has a glow, but best of all my face feels so clean after I use this.</li>
            <li> Like Aveda does, for an example--their products smell amazing and it gives products a pampering fun &amp;#34;spa-like&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes my skin felt great, soft and hydrated without being greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> It is a soft mixture and makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I like masks and fun products to make my skin feel nice</li>
            <li> The paste is released in drop sized amounts through a pump dispenser and absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply...</li>
            <li> They really need to enclose the container in a nice box with instructions and more information.  </li>
            <li> It’s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> on it&#x27;s own, you look better, and a bit younger- perfect for guys going to a reunion or social event.  </li>
            <li> It’s light and almost feathery; in fact, in the 10 minutes of recommended time that it was on, it was easy to forget I even had a mask</li>
            <li> product experience is fine.  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing and nice, but not too  girly, so hubby can enjoy pampering his skin as well.  </li>
            <li> For one thing, it goes on smoothly and lightly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is light yet sturdy and does not have any abrasives that I could</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes your face feel smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> For best results use a quality facial serum followed by application of moisturizer to really reap the benefits that this mask provides.</li>
            <li> My skin feels better moisturized immediately after use, about the same as using a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> All in all, a nice product that I will enjoy the rest of the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t purchase this particular brand.</li>
            <li> in all, I just expected more and better, ie, a pump that dispenses more smoothly, and a mask that produces more hydration and not a bunch of bumps.  </li>
            <li> Its more of a normal mud masque for lack of a better description.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know the Phyto 5  brand and was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to facial masks I have always loved the outcome and clarifying effects of a fine quality clay mask on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to gently exfoliate, deliver antioxidant protection, visibly brighten, smooth and hydrate your skin, leaving a refreshing glow.  </li>
            <li> nothing special, but did the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t do anything special for me, it smells funky while on (a recommended 10 minutes)</li>
            <li> After drying, my face did feel smooth - though really, not to the point where I was especially excited about it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I left it on for the recommended 10 minutes and it worked great.</li>
            <li> The pumping mechanism does not evenly distribute the mask and I wasn’t quite sure how much of it to use.  </li>
            <li> pump container is very efficient, allowing you to dispense just the amount you want without ever touching or contaminating the product inside.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed and can see myself doing this at least once a week, though they do recommend on the amazon site 2x per week is recommended.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards, my skin was a bit lighter and brighter and drier, though I did develop a red bump on my forehead at one point (which could be good if the mask is drawing out impurities, I suppose, or perhaps that wasn&#x27;t the fault of the mask).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t feel more softness or much tone improvement.</li>
            <li> There are no instructions on the bottle (one reason this doesn&#x27;t get a full five stars), but the instructions are on the Amazon page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does wash off easily.&lt;br /&gt;The use of almost all natural ingredients and some organic ingredients is a nice change.</li>
            <li> It seems like a pretty easy way to enhance your skin.</li>
            <li> scent is nice, too, subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a while to pump and then sometimes comes out too quickly</li>
            <li> In general, I liked it.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars for that - if you are going to charge me $26 for a little over an ounce of product, please make it exceptional!</li>
            <li> If with continued use, I see something amazing, I&#x27;ll come back and note it.</li>
            <li> There are many positives about Ageless La Cure Natural Face Mask by Phyto.  </li>
            <li> but then my skin absorbed it&lt;</li>
            <li> This is a really nice facial mask.</li>
            <li> I believe the price may be worth adding this to my cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li> My face where I&#x27;d applied the clay was clean, but the skin appeared slightly more coarse and dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> point is good in my opinion unlike other reviewers if applied sparingly&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no flaky, itchy or sticky aftermath; rather, my skin felt tightened and hydrated right away.</li>
            <li> I was right.  </li>
            <li> product felt fine going on, and I liked the slight lemon verbena smell which offset the mud/mineral odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a very earthy, muddy smell that is on the strong side, and doesn&#x27;t dissipate all that much as the mask dries.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li> : It is very gentle, with the scent not that overpowering.</li>
            <li> My skin experienced no sensitivity or redness, as is sometimes common with masks.</li>
            <li> I liked the write-up on this company, so I was curious to try an algae-based product.</li>
            <li> this point, the algae mask has taken over from clay as my favorite facial beauty</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was the scent smelled like lemons but not quite</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this and think I actually would splurge and buy this after this runs out.  </li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I kept waiting for it to harden.</li>
            <li> unannounced)&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> First of all, you need to read the information on Amazon to even know how you’re supposed to use it.  </li>
            <li> I have used Phyto hair products for years but this is the first face product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is a great for dry skin, and I hope to see future benefits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and it leaves my face super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> And it will make your skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> The Phyto 5 Ageless La Cure Organic Algae Mousse mask left my face feeling smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Overall, absolutely loved the product and would definitely look to purchase it and recommend to friends!</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t notice any real difference in my complexion (50-ish skin, fair, average amount of fine wrinkles and age spots, tends to be dry</li>
            <li> Because I have acne prone skin, I still used my Clean and Clear Dual Action moisturizer which is a very light moisturizer (to me anyway) and didn&#x27;t have to use anything else prior to applying my foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I did feel my skin  looked more even due to the dry patches improving and for sure</li>
            <li> but I did feel my skin  looked more even due to the dry patches improving and for sure</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to long-term benefits, but the mask certainly left my face feeling smooth and well hydrated.  </li>
            <li> The results aren&#x27;t all that noticeable, though, and I expected more from a product at this price point.  </li>
            <li> I found the skin to be rejuvenated, and ready for HD make-up, as their is a lifting component.</li>
            <li> the brightening effect could very well be the product doing its job.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt lightly moisturized after and the next morning.  </li>
            <li> It’s very “greasy”.  </li>
            <li> and you can’t really see it at all.  </li>
            <li> It did not seem to do much in the way of moisterizing.</li>
            <li> She feels that the price of the mask is a reasonable one.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Appropriate for all skin types this facial mask (soft paste) provides a sumptuous finish with all the benefits of exfoliation, hydration and antioxidant skin restoratives.</li>
            <li> , I noticed my dry patches are much better and this doesn&#x27;t stimulate more oil production that I&#x27;ve experienced with most other mask products I&#x27;ve tried in the past which would leave my face super shiny by the afternoon and made my makeup feel gloppy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The other two were okay--</li>
            <li> Hands down, the Phyto 5 Mask did a better job of refining my pores and exfoliating the skin.</li>
            <li> After the 10 minutes were up, the mask was easy to remove with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li> This left my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Many were much more expensive than this product.  </li>
            <li> But in researching the ingredients, they are all highly touted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I just wish the price weren&#x27;t as high for the amount given.</li>
            <li> A little more than a year ago, I started using a pumpkin peel from Skin Obsession every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Though this product is certified organic, there is something in it with which my skin really doesn&#x27;t agree, so anyone who has sensitive skin should probably use this with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mask actually is not too thick and goes on smoothly, it does not get too dry on your face, which is good.  </li>
            <li> This came at just the right time.&lt;br /&gt;Summer and city make for a hard climate for one&#x27;s skin and this easily applied mousse</li>
            <li> It was easy to get it out by just pushing it down with one finger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel overly tight when dry, and washes off easily with a warm, wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser is handy, but be careful not to &amp;#34;overpump,&amp;#34; as a smaller amount is necessary than you might think.  </li>
            <li> It softens better than my usual routine, didn&#x27;t cause any distress or breakouts of my skin</li>
            <li> It softens better than my usual routine, didn&#x27;t cause any distress or breakouts of my skin</li>
            <li> My skin felt smoother than usual and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The Ageless Algae Mask went on smoothly, and as it was not clear from the limited instructions about how much to apply, I went liberally.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d give it 3 stars for price for amount of product provided, that my face didn&#x27;t feel especially different afterward, and the &amp;#34;scent;&amp;#34; 3.5 stars for how it made my facial skin seem to look right after rinsing; 4 stars for how it feels if you rub a bit into your skin and don&#x27;t wash it away!)  </li>
            <li> I smoothed on a light cover of mask, which means this container will last a long time.</li>
            <li> In fact, the only ingredients listed are Algae, Vitamin E, Glycerin, Organic Verbena Flower Water, Organic Sweet Almond Oil and Aquaxyl, the latter described as hyaluronic acid booster which optimizes the circulation of water throughout the layers of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many masks leave my skin feeling irritated, and some have even left a slight burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> Removing the mask is easy and only requires the use of a wet washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the ingredients listed on the bottle, labeled under INCI guidelines (International Nomenclature for Cosmetic Ingredients), are organic and sounded absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once applied, it doesn&#x27;t burn or pull, and there is only a very minuscule sensation of tightening.  </li>
            <li> and my skin did feel soft</li>
            <li> This looks like it would be like the old clay masks we all have used before.</li>
            <li> At nearly $50 for this bottle, it&#x27;s rather steep.  </li>
            <li> Ageless La Cure Natural  Organic Algae Mousse Face Mask by</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also certified organic and 98.9% of the ingredients are of natural origin.  </li>
            <li> My adult daughter (who lives with me) used this mask twice a week for a month.</li>
            <li> I am worried that she will cause damage to her skin with such make-up so we look for cleansing agents that are gentle and may help her skin over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d purchase this particular mask when there are so many more much less expensive products out there.</li>
            <li> I expected a greenish kind of color, not sure why, but in my head that is what I thought</li>
            <li> /&gt;To truly test the results for myself, I decided to apply my favorite clay mask to one half of my face and neck, and Phyto 5 algae on the other.</li>
            <li> used to clay masks that dry to a hardened shell and in the interim, make me look like I’m getting ready for Halloween.  </li>
            <li> And as for cost effectiveness, I would just as soon use an inexpensive exfoliant to clean my pores, followed by my usual rosehips seed oil to moisturize.  </li>
            <li> First, I have to say that the manufacturers choosing not to have printed instructions on the product was an odd choice to make, in that it forces people to come to sites like Amazon in order to find out how much to apply, how long to leave the product on, etc.  </li>
            <li> The key ingredients with this product are micro and macro algae along with sweet almond oil, Aquaxyl and other essential marine minerals.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey -- but then, we&#x27;re worth it, aren&#x27;t we ladies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t harden like some facial masks, either, but instead stayed soft.</li>
            <li> this is the only one so far that seems to fulfill that promise.</li>
            <li> Massage gently with wet hands.</li>
            <li> The key ingredients – algae, sweet almond oil and the hydrating compound Aquaxyl promise antioxidant protection and I am unschooled about whether it does or not.  </li>
            <li> this product with other items, like vitamins, and other light facial cleansers and moisturizers should help your skin become healthier and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> made my skin feel soft, but I didn&#x27;t notice enough of a difference that it would become a regular part of my routine.</li>
            <li> , it comes out a really not very attractive color kind of a yellow&#x27;y&#x27; brown color.  </li>
            <li> The pump-action for the first use takes a little bit of doing to get the product out of the bottle, but after that first-time use, there is no problem pumping out the product.  </li>
            <li> It’s not cheap, but the price has fallen since it was first listed.  </li>
            <li> There was a slight tingle on my skin that lasted a moment or two, somewhat like a niacin flush, but gentle.</li>
            <li> This product would likely work well for people who have normal skin, but for me, it&#x27;s been mostly disappointing and has caused more issues than it&#x27;s solved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I need so little and only use it twice a week (as per recommended), this container should last me probably at least 6 weeks and maybe even as much as 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it the second time, I didn&#x27;t bother trying to moisturize my dry patches because they were pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> Usually I apply a moisturizing lotion to the dry patches but try to avoid the rest of my face because later in the day, it makes my skin look super shiny.</li>
            <li> ....weird but had to go back to the amazon site to find out how long this was supposed to stay on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is morning as I tried it, and I looked a bit peaked and tired - after the mask, I did seem a little more &amp;#34;bright-faced&amp;#34; and awake.</li>
            <li> if you look hard enough - yet, I also wasn&#x27;t expecting a thing from this product since I didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Skin Type: sensitive with slight rosacea Age: 50s  </li>
            <li> The consistency is not very thick - though  it isn&#x27;t a mousse like your hair care product mousse - but lighter than the usual facial &amp;#34;mud mask.&amp;#34; I then left it on my face for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The under-eye area is tightened after one use, and offers long term benefits, after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> In the future, I will apply less of this Swiss-made product so that the bottle  will last longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a few pumps to get enough of the mask out--and the pump was hard to work at first</li>
            <li> You leave the mask on for 10 minutes, and in that time it does dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> but I still get dry patches here</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t usually dry either.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake and dry out on your skin.</li>
            <li> Even though it’s not a great smell, it’s very mild, and not potent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> mask itself is a brownish color that, once you apply it to the skin, forms a pretty thin, almost transparent mask.  </li>
            <li> I expected a mask that was thicker and would dry a bit.  </li>

            <li> The directions on the Amazon page (not listed on the bottle itself) read to massage in with wet fingertips and leave on for about 10 minutes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> The Phyto 5 Ageless La Cure Organic Algae Mousse mask left my face feeling smooth and fresh.  Many masks leave my skin feeling irritated, and some have even left a slight burning sensation.  Not so with this product.  This left my skin feeling soothed instead.  The pump dispenser is handy, but be careful not to &amp;#34;overpump,&amp;#34; as a smaller amount is necessary than you might think.  There are no instructions on the bottle, so I had to look at the Amazon product page, which is something that I don&#x27;t like.  How hard is it to place short instructions on the bottle?  Anyway, I like the product and will continue to use twice a week.  This is a great for dry skin, and I hope to see future benefits.</li>
            <li> Appropriate for all skin types this facial mask (soft paste) provides a sumptuous finish with all the benefits of exfoliation, hydration and antioxidant skin restoratives. The key ingredients with this product are micro and macro algae along with sweet almond oil, Aquaxyl and other essential marine minerals. The paste has an earthy pea soup color with hints of vegetation and citrus on the fragrance. The paste is released in drop sized amounts through a pump dispenser and absorbs easily into the skin. Within a couple of minutes the pale green paste on your skin grows fainter to the point where it&#x27;s almost unnoticeable. Instructions suggest the utilization of a damp towel or sponge ten minutes after use for removal but I find it best to gently rinse your face over the sink followed by a gentle pat clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finished results are excellent - skin texture is tangibly smoother and softer with a nice, hydrated appearance. For best results use a quality facial serum followed by application of moisturizer to really reap the benefits that this mask provides.</li>
            <li> There are many positives about Ageless La Cure Natural Face Mask by Phyto.  For one thing, it goes on smoothly and lightly.  I’m used to clay masks that dry to a hardened shell and in the interim, make me look like I’m getting ready for Halloween.  This is NOT that kind of mask. It’s light and almost feathery; in fact, in the 10 minutes of recommended time that it was on, it was easy to forget I even had a mask on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinses off quite well. There is no flaky, itchy or sticky aftermath; rather, my skin felt tightened and hydrated right away. My skin experienced no sensitivity or redness, as is sometimes common with masks. The key ingredients – algae, sweet almond oil and the hydrating compound Aquaxyl promise antioxidant protection and I am unschooled about whether it does or not.  But in researching the ingredients, they are all highly touted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives? As many others have already noted, there are no instructions.  The directions on the back are so tiny that it was hard for me to read them even with my reading glasses, and I had to search for how to use it.  The pumping mechanism does not evenly distribute the mask and I wasn’t quite sure how much of it to use.  And lastly, had I purchased it (I received this from the Vine program in exchange for an honest review), I would have balked a bit at the price for just 1.75 ounces. All in all, recommended.</li>
            <li> (This review comes from the female side of the family). When it comes to facial masks I have always loved the outcome and clarifying effects of a fine quality clay mask on my skin. I liked the write-up on this company, so I was curious to try an algae-based product. All the ingredients listed on the bottle, labeled under INCI guidelines (International Nomenclature for Cosmetic Ingredients), are organic and sounded absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I take algae as a supplement (spirulina) and consume seaweed in my diet, I was intrigued by the cosmetic aspect of it in a facial product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To truly test the results for myself, I decided to apply my favorite clay mask to one half of my face and neck, and Phyto 5 algae on the other. The Ageless Algae Mask went on smoothly, and as it was not clear from the limited instructions about how much to apply, I went liberally.  There was a slight tingle on my skin that lasted a moment or two, somewhat like a niacin flush, but gentle. It felt soothing. Of course the clay soon stiffened, but the algae mask made my skin feel supple. After 20 to 30 minutes, I wiped and rinsed both sides of my face and neck. I did not apply any toner or moisturizer for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the evening, the skin where I&#x27;d applied the algae mask was wonderfully moist and young-looking. My face where I&#x27;d applied the clay was clean, but the skin appeared slightly more coarse and dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my 10X magnifying mirror, I examined my neck and facial skin closely. Hands down, the Phyto 5 Mask did a better job of refining my pores and exfoliating the skin. Also, the fragrance of the product is pleasant. In the future, I will apply less of this Swiss-made product so that the bottle  will last longer. It is a little pricey -- but then, we&#x27;re worth it, aren&#x27;t we ladies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, the algae mask has taken over from clay as my favorite facial beauty treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Thanks to the influence of my sister, I&#x27;ve been using other products from Phyto for skin and hair care for the past few years.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the ones I&#x27;ve tried and found them to be eminently suitable for their intended purpose.  That the company does not conduct any animal testing is another plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This algae mousse face mask has a vaguely earthy scent, not unpleasant but a reminder that it isn&#x27;t filled with unnecessary perfumes and artificial ingredients.  In fact, the only ingredients listed are Algae, Vitamin E, Glycerin, Organic Verbena Flower Water, Organic Sweet Almond Oil and Aquaxyl, the latter described as hyaluronic acid booster which optimizes the circulation of water throughout the layers of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump container is very efficient, allowing you to dispense just the amount you want without ever touching or contaminating the product inside.  While no instructions accompanied the mask, Amazon&#x27;s product page suggests that it be used once or twice a week until it is gone.  I left it on for about 10 minutes, rinsed my face with water and then applied toner.  I can&#x27;t speak to long-term benefits, but the mask certainly left my face feeling smooth and well hydrated.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure but I like the effect and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> First, I have to say that the manufacturers choosing not to have printed instructions on the product was an odd choice to make, in that it forces people to come to sites like Amazon in order to find out how much to apply, how long to leave the product on, etc.  I&#x27;m not a fan of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging also leaves something to be desired.  The pump seems to work well for some people, but for me, it took so long to prime it just to get an initial bit of product to dispense that I was actually worried that it was broken and unusable.  When I finally did get it to dispense, it comes out in odd little spurts of varying amounts.  On the plus side, I do like that you don&#x27;t have to dig into a jar, so you&#x27;re not introducing a lot of bacteria into the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself is a brownish color that, once you apply it to the skin, forms a pretty thin, almost transparent mask.  It does have a very earthy, muddy smell that is on the strong side, and doesn&#x27;t dissipate all that much as the mask dries.  Once applied, it doesn&#x27;t burn or pull, and there is only a very minuscule sensation of tightening.  Removing the mask is easy and only requires the use of a wet washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results, I&#x27;d been experiencing dry patches and flakiness, and this product seemed to ease that a little bit.  The results aren&#x27;t all that noticeable, though, and I expected more from a product at this price point.  There was also a bit of increased softness, but - and this is the biggest downside for me - it also yielded bumps and spots.  Immediately.  Though this product is certified organic, there is something in it with which my skin really doesn&#x27;t agree, so anyone who has sensitive skin should probably use this with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I just expected more and better, ie, a pump that dispenses more smoothly, and a mask that produces more hydration and not a bunch of bumps.  This product would likely work well for people who have normal skin, but for me, it&#x27;s been mostly disappointing and has caused more issues than it&#x27;s solved.</li>
            <li> I had to find out how to use the product because there were no directions on the product.  I decided that they would be wash your face, use the mask and take it off.  I was right.  The pump took a lot of priming before any product would come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it did come out, I liked the way it felt.  It was a little earthy but it dried well and came off well.  It&#x27;s very expensive so I don&#x27;t see myself buying anymore.  If money isn&#x27;t an issue, trying it may not be a bad idea.</li>
            <li> Perfect hydrating mask!  I found the skin to be rejuvenated, and ready for HD make-up, as their is a lifting component. Great for on-camera work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The under-eye area is tightened after one use, and offers long term benefits, after a few weeks of use. All of the Phyto 5 products are good, and  are in pro-make-up kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used on it&#x27;s own, you look better, and a bit younger- perfect for guys going to a reunion or social event.  Or a job interview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a bit of every day luxury that works the 1st time, and gets better!</li>
            <li> oooooh la-la.....I like masks and fun products to make my skin feel nice and it&#x27;s been a while since I treated myself to a product like this.  Here is what I expected vs. what I got.... I expected the instructions to be on the bottle, no....weird but had to go back to the amazon site to find out how long this was supposed to stay on my face.  I expected a mask that was thicker and would dry a bit.  The mask actually is not too thick and goes on smoothly, it does not get too dry on your face, which is good.  I expected a greenish kind of color, not sure why, but in my head that is what I thought, it comes out a really not very attractive color kind of a yellow&#x27;y&#x27; brown color.  First thing I noticed was the scent smelled like lemons but not quite and I realized that was the verbena.  Very relaxing and nice, but not too  girly, so hubby can enjoy pampering his skin as well.  I also noticed that my hands were immediately softer from putting on the mask.  After 10 minutes my skin felt great, soft and hydrated without being greasy or oily.  I was very impressed and can see myself doing this at least once a week, though they do recommend on the amazon site 2x per week is recommended.  I really enjoyed this and think I actually would splurge and buy this after this runs out.  Overall, absolutely loved the product and would definitely look to purchase it and recommend to friends!</li>
            <li> This lightweight mask nearly disappeared visually over the 10 minutes I left it on -- I could feel it but not really see it. Afterwards, my skin was a bit lighter and brighter and drier, though I did develop a red bump on my forehead at one point (which could be good if the mask is drawing out impurities, I suppose, or perhaps that wasn&#x27;t the fault of the mask).&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product both before and after my morning shower, and &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; was better for me since it rinsed off thoroughly, but I didn&#x27;t feel more softness or much tone improvement. My skin is robust, so I suspect I just need a heavier mask.&lt;br /&gt;A minus is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t have the directions printed on it, so look it up beforehand if you use it in the shower as I did. As a plus, though, it isn&#x27;t heavily scented.</li>
            <li> Skin Type: sensitive with slight rosacea Age: 50s  (I&#x27;d give it 3 stars for price for amount of product provided, that my face didn&#x27;t feel especially different afterward, and the &amp;#34;scent;&amp;#34; 3.5 stars for how it made my facial skin seem to look right after rinsing; 4 stars for how it feels if you rub a bit into your skin and don&#x27;t wash it away!)  Packaged in a plain white plastic bottle. Pump-action application. 1 3/4 oz. Certified organic. &amp;#34;Mousse-like&amp;#34; consistency.  Pump out about a nickel or dime-sized amount onto your fingertips and apply to face. The directions on the Amazon page (not listed on the bottle itself) read to massage in with wet fingertips and leave on for about 10 minutes. The pump-action for the first use takes a little bit of doing to get the product out of the bottle, but after that first-time use, there is no problem pumping out the product.  I massaged in about a dime-sized amount - the product&#x27;s scent isn&#x27;t nice. Almost smells &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; but I also know that many organic products don&#x27;t use scent. However, as I always write, I&#x27;d love it if more products added a citrus or spicy scent to their products! Like Aveda does, for an example--their products smell amazing and it gives products a pampering fun &amp;#34;spa-like&amp;#34; feel. The consistency is not very thick - though  it isn&#x27;t a mousse like your hair care product mousse - but lighter than the usual facial &amp;#34;mud mask.&amp;#34; I then left it on my face for about 10 minutes. No stinging, burning, or tingling. It didn&#x27;t harden like some facial masks, either, but instead stayed soft. I kind of like the tightening/hardening effect of masks but that didn&#x27;t put me off on this product.  I didn&#x27;t use a sponge or cloth as the directions suggested, but instead just rinsed it away with my hands. A sponge or washcloth may work better, as it took a while to wash away the mask - it felt slippery, though not in a bad way, but it did take some doing to remove it all, so yes, I would suggest a washcloth or sponge to remove the excess then wash away the rest.  After drying, my face did feel smooth - though really, not to the point where I was especially excited about it. I gave it 3 stars for that - if you are going to charge me $26 for a little over an ounce of product, please make it exceptional! Now, for all I know this product is exceptional in what it does, but I have to experience it more exceptionally for that price. However, I did notice something different about my face. It is morning as I tried it, and I looked a bit peaked and tired - after the mask, I did seem a little more &amp;#34;bright-faced&amp;#34; and awake. I&#x27;m always a skeptic, and it could be I was just looking for something and you often find what you are looking for if you look hard enough - yet, I also wasn&#x27;t expecting a thing from this product since I didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; anything, so the brightening effect could very well be the product doing its job.  The directions say to do this routine 1 - 2 times a week for 3 months. That&#x27;s likely all that you will get from this bottle. It&#x27;s a little pricey, so I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d purchase this particular mask when there are so many more much less expensive products out there. Products like facial cleansers and masks probably do not stay on the skin long enough to change anything on a deep skin level, so I&#x27;d save my money for things like serums and moisturizers and purchase less expensive cleansers and masks.  I did put some on the back of my hand and massaged it in and my skin did feel soft (I didn&#x27;t rinse it away and it doesn&#x27;t feel tacky or sticky at all). I do like this product - I just wish the price weren&#x27;t as high for the amount given. You do get what you pay for, but as I said, I would save that money for products that stay on my face longer.  All in all, a nice product that I will enjoy the rest of the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t purchase this particular brand. If with continued use, I see something amazing, I&#x27;ll come back and note it.</li>
            <li> This looks like it would be like the old clay masks we all have used before. The color is the same anyway. When I first put it on, I kept waiting for it to harden. It never did. This one works differently. It is a soft mixture and makes your skin feel great. My skin feels softer and it definitely has a glow, but best of all my face feels so clean after I use this. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now tried three Phyto 5 products--the facial cleanser, the toner, and this mask. The other two were okay--nothing special, but did the job. This is significantly better. The mask feels very smooth going on. It&#x27;s not the most attractive color--a kind of yellowish brown--but it feels really nice. There are no instructions on the bottle (one reason this doesn&#x27;t get a full five stars), but the instructions are on the Amazon page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few pumps to get enough of the mask out--and the pump was hard to work at first (strike two on star rating).The scent is nice, too, subtle and pleasant. You leave the mask on for 10 minutes, and in that time it does dry thoroughly. It doesn&#x27;t feel overly tight when dry, and washes off easily with a warm, wet washcloth. This left my face feeling soft and smooth. The other Phyto 5 products I&#x27;ve tried have promised to &amp;#34;hydrate&amp;#34; skin, but this is the only one so far that seems to fulfill that promise.The only other thing that knocks down the star rating is the price. At nearly $50 for this bottle, it&#x27;s rather steep.  If this were not so expensive, I&#x27;d be quite inclined to purchase more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but I still get dry patches here and there so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was for me or not because it says for dehydrated skin or skin lacking minerals. Usually I apply a moisturizing lotion to the dry patches but try to avoid the rest of my face because later in the day, it makes my skin look super shiny. It&#x27;s very hard to try to just moisturize a few spots on my cheeks without getting on the oily parts near my nose. Just for the record, I just turned 50 but I still have acne prone skin so have to watch what I put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and it leaves my face super soft and smooth. I use it after cleansing at bedtime and in the morning, after showering then applying my makeup, I noticed my dry patches are much better and this doesn&#x27;t stimulate more oil production that I&#x27;ve experienced with most other mask products I&#x27;ve tried in the past which would leave my face super shiny by the afternoon and made my makeup feel gloppy and uncomfortable. I don&#x27;t get that at all with this mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might seem expensive but I&#x27;ve found about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pump is plenty to cover my face and forehead. You wet your hands, pump the product into your palm, rub hands together and apply. The first time I used it, I left it on for the recommended 10 minutes and it worked great. The second time I went to load the dishwasher and probably left it on closer to 20 minutes but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I need so little and only use it twice a week (as per recommended), this container should last me probably at least 6 weeks and maybe even as much as 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it the second time, I didn&#x27;t bother trying to moisturize my dry patches because they were pretty much gone. Because I have acne prone skin, I still used my Clean and Clear Dual Action moisturizer which is a very light moisturizer (to me anyway) and didn&#x27;t have to use anything else prior to applying my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or lines (yet) so I don&#x27;t know if this would improve the appearance of those or not but I did feel my skin  looked more even due to the dry patches improving and for sure it was softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering price at the time of this review and overall performance of this product, I would buy in the future. It softens better than my usual routine, didn&#x27;t cause any distress or breakouts of my skin and it&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time.have wrinkles or lines (yet) so I don&#x27;t know if this would improve the appearance of those or not but I did feel my skin  looked more even due to the dry patches improving and for sure it was softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering price at the time of this review and overall performance of this product, I would buy in the future. It softens better than my usual routine, didn&#x27;t cause any distress or breakouts of my skin and it&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time.</li>
            <li> My wife used this The Phyto5 mousse d’algues and found it to be an excellent facial mousse.  It is lightweight and it improved the texture of her skin.  She has oily skin and wrinkles.  The mousse did not make her skin oily and helped to improve overall skin appearance.  It is easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li> A little more than a year ago, I started using a pumpkin peel from Skin Obsession every two weeks. (I&#x27;m in my mid-40s, with fair skin and light eyes.)  I&#x27;ve been looking for a moisturizing mask to add to my routine, and am now using the pumpkin peel every month.  When I saw the opportunity to try this out, I was quite happy to do so.  I know the Phyto 5  brand and was excited to try this product.  In general, I liked it.  My skin felt lightly moisturized after and the next morning.  It&#x27;s not a deep hydrating masque in my opinion.  At the price it&#x27;s listed for now, it&#x27;s a good value.  There were two issues regarding the product IMHO:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The mask did not come out of the container very easily and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s not really a mousse as stated on its label.  Its more of a normal mud masque for lack of a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it moisturized my skin well, but the product did not have the luxurious feel/texture I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This came at just the right time.&lt;br /&gt;Summer and city make for a hard climate for one&#x27;s skin and this easily applied mousse&lt;br /&gt;Had an immediate effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is light yet sturdy and does not have any abrasives that I could feel.&lt;br /&gt;The light tan masque goes on smoothly and the the results when wash away are wonderful.  It feels just a bit oily but then my skin absorbed it&lt;br /&gt;with the result that it left my face feeling smooth and wonderfully re-hydrated&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I will return again and again.&lt;br /&gt;It is a sumptuous mud bath on a smaller scale for my face that I can use at home</li>
            <li> This is a really nice facial mask. You definitely pay the quality of it in the price. It was easy to apply... I just pumped a few times and had enough to put a thin layer on my face. I let it sit for the recommended 10 minutes and then washed it off. My skin felt really great afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no directions on the bottle but the amazon page recommends that you use this mask twice a week. It seems like a pretty easy way to enhance your skin.</li>
            <li> Ageless La Cure Natural  Organic Algae Mousse Face Mask by Phyto&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had bad experiences with masks in the past even with very expensive ones like the Dr. Weil masks sold at Origins.  Many were much more expensive than this product.  I have had rosacea for years and I was worried that this mask might also make my skin redder and more prone to breakouts.  The organic algae caught my eye and I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to dispense&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Transparent (so your hubby doesn&#x27;t have a heart attack when he comes in unannounced)&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;Can be applied 10 minutes before shower and then washed off in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Price point is good in my opinion unlike other reviewers if applied sparingly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to pump and then sometimes comes out too quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice weekly for 3.5 weeks.  And I don&#x27;t notice any real difference in my complexion (50-ish skin, fair, average amount of fine wrinkles and age spots, tends to be dry skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product experience is fine.  The dispenser works great, it feels nice on the skin (not dry and cakey), has a nice mild smell, and washes off well with a washcloth. My skin feels better moisturized immediately after use, about the same as using a good moisturizer.  But it&#x27;s a lot simpler to just use a moisturizer than to apply mask, wait, and wash.</li>
            <li> This is an algae mousse facial mask by Ageless La Cure and I guess it works well.  It&#x27;s supposed to gently exfoliate, deliver antioxidant protection, visibly brighten, smooth and hydrate your skin, leaving a refreshing glow.  It&#x27;s also certified organic and 98.9% of the ingredients are of natural origin.  This is all good, assuming it&#x27;s all true (and I have no reason to doubt that it could be).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t do anything special for me, it smells funky while on (a recommended 10 minutes) and it&#x27;s messy to rinse off.  And as for cost effectiveness, I would just as soon use an inexpensive exfoliant to clean my pores, followed by my usual rosehips seed oil to moisturize.  So this algae mousse isn&#x27;t going to be added to my skin care program.  YMMV, of course.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have oily skin, and I do take supplements for hair, skin, and nails.  My skin isn&#x27;t usually dry either. I do use an astringent and face wash about twice a week. But anything that will help the skin look healthy, I welcome. You do get a small amount for the price, but this product does work. It does help the skin feel refreshed and gives is a healthier look. But it depends on what the status of your skin was before using the product. Apply the product to the skin, leave on for 10 minutes, and wipe and wash off. It does wash off easily.&lt;br /&gt;The use of almost all natural ingredients and some organic ingredients is a nice change. I don&#x27;t like using harsh chemicals, especially on my face. Some of the ingredients are oils and provide either an aroma (Citral, Citronellol, Geraniol), while others do nourish the skin (tocopherols, algae).&lt;br /&gt;Using this product with other items, like vitamins, and other light facial cleansers and moisturizers should help your skin become healthier and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> Though they call this a “face mask”, it’s unlike any sort of “mask” that I’ve used in the past.  First of all, you need to read the information on Amazon to even know how you’re supposed to use it.  No instructions are listed on the container, or came with the container.  They really need to enclose the container in a nice box with instructions and more information.  Here’s what Amazon shows as the proper way to use this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, apply twice a week, or as needed, until product is finished. Apply a small amount after cleansing and toning. Massage gently with wet hands. Leave on for 10 minutes, and remove well with sponge or facial cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is hard to describe.  It’s very “greasy”.  A bit like “greasy mud”.  I use about the size of a pea on each hand.  It’s easy to apply.  It’s brown with a green tint.  It doesn’t have a great smell, but it’s not horrid either.  From what I can tell, it doesn’t look like they added any “fragrance” to it, and the smell is simply the combined ingredients.  Even though it’s not a great smell, it’s very mild, and not potent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found “odd” is that after you apply . . . . it’s only a few minutes and you can’t really see it at all.  Very little comes off onto a sponge when you remove it.  I actually use it before I go to bed.  This way I can do a good face wash in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes your face feel smooth and hydrated.  I actually use less moisturizer after I use it.  It’s quite a nice product.  It’s not cheap, but the price has fallen since it was first listed.  Overall I’m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> Although lemon is not one of my favorite scents, the verbena does cover the smell of the algae in this product. I smoothed on a light cover of mask, which means this container will last a long time. This does not tighten as it dries, which feels nice. After the 10 minutes were up, the mask was easy to remove with a wet cloth. My skin felt smoother than usual and I am pleased with the results. I have used Phyto hair products for years but this is the first face product I&#x27;ve used. I believe the price may be worth adding this to my cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li> My adult daughter (who lives with me) used this mask twice a week for a month. Here&#x27;s what she learned. Overall it works well. It made her skin feel smoother, cleared up some of her acne, and got rid of redness.  It did not seem to do much in the way of moisterizing. She also commented that she needed to get used to the smell of the mask. She feels that the price of the mask is a reasonable one.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Background: My daughter has problem skin. And she is getting into make-up. I am worried that she will cause damage to her skin with such make-up so we look for cleansing agents that are gentle and may help her skin over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: What happened to the instructions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It is very gentle, with the scent not that overpowering. More like a citrus smell. You only need to use it twice a week. And it will make your skin feel soft and clean. It doesn&#x27;t flake and dry out on your skin. In fact, it starts to vanish after a few minutes and can be taken off with a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to see any damage to my daughter&#x27;s face as a result of using it. And I think it is actually helping to lessen some of the problem areas because it helps to keep the face moisturized.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions for use on the bottle, so that was a turn off. I did like the way the product dispensed. It was easy to get it out by just pushing it down with one finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product felt fine going on, and I liked the slight lemon verbena smell which offset the mud/mineral odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This made my skin feel soft, but I didn&#x27;t notice enough of a difference that it would become a regular part of my routine.</li>
