            <li> I use it for Fibro and works better than pills or Biofreeze. Can&#x27;t live without it. Great on wrist, elbow, knee and ankle pain too.</li>
            <li> I live this .It works really well for me</li>
            <li> I have been using Kool &#x27;N Fit as recommended by my Chiropractor several years ago and found that this is the best place to buy it.</li>
            <li> I am a self employed carpenter, I often do a lot of heavy lifting, and get a lot of lower back and knee pain. This stuff works very well in relieving the pain. I recommend it highly!  Knees, sholders, back, wherever there is pain.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I have used Kool N Fit for over a year for my knee.  I need a knee replacement, which I have been trying to hold off from having surgery.  Kool N Fit reduced the pain and helps me to remain active.</li>
            <li> I first starting using this product in the spring through my chiropractor.  I am still using the same 2 - 8 oz. bottles!! I don&#x27;t have to use very much, a few quick sprays and it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  Don&#x27;t have to rub it in.  Not too bad of a smell, but it is very cold.   This gets rid of headaches caused from tense neck muscles also!!  It has been so wonderful that I decided to buy another bottle, one for home and one to take with me.  I use it on other people to help them and they have become believers as well.      It product works within a few minutes and lasts a very long time and does an excellent job with my lower back pain and joints.  I don&#x27;t mind paying the price since it lasts so long and I have spent a lot less in Aleve.</li>

            <li> The best for aches/pains. Very good shipping..</li>
            <li> This is miraculous!!!! You will not believe how wonderful this product is.  I gave a bottle to my daughter who suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis.  The joints on her hands are swollen and in constant pain.. She sprayed this on and was astounded at the way it took away the pain.  I use it on humongous leg cramps at night and it is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve tried that stops them.&lt;br /&gt;Buy Kool &#x27;n Fit... you will be so happy... and pain free!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product successfully for many years to alleviate muscle cramps.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law put this on my husbands back after a long BBQ.  It does work for minor aches and pains, though I will say this:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is SOOO COLD as it goes on, sheer misery while being applied.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It has a very distinct smell.  And people around you WILL notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it is advertised to do, but frankly I think Jack&#x27;s Answer is a far superior product.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Works so well on aching muscles and sprains! Dancers use this stuff.</li>
            <li> The BEST pain relieving formula on the market.  I have been using this spray for over 2 years and I find that it does the trick every time!</li>
            <li> This product works just great for temporary relief of joint and muscle pain without the strong smell of so many of these products.  The best way to use it is to buy the squirt bottle and just refill that, then you can squirt it where you need it, reaching places without assistance and you don&#x27;t even have to wash your hands afterwards.  I like it better than Bio-freeze.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and an excellent price!</li>
            <li> I have Fibromyalgia and this is the only product that helps me with my neck ans shoulder pain. Also it works in other areas like your back and knees. I buy it all the time. My kids also buy it for me as gift. I couldn&#x27;t  do with out it.</li>
            <li> This really works!  After a brutal soccer game this works to ease the bruising pain.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product for MANY years, and it is one of the very best analgesics for muscle tightness or cramping, that we have ever found.  This product goes with us even when we travel overseas....it&#x27;s just that good!</li>
            <li> We have bought a number of bottles of Kool and Fit over the years and it is by far a great pain releaver</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I had a small bottle with pump so now just order larger size to refill smaller bottle.  There are other products similar but I haven&#x27;t found anything I like better than this.  I love that fact that you spray it on and don&#x27;t have to get it on your hands.  Also I can spray it on my neck and not have to worry about it staining my clothes.  Really helps with headaches.  My dad now buys it to help with his neck.  He has arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;JB</li>
            <li> We use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a use other than what it is intended.  Upon enduring a collembola/fungal infestation of my skin, I came across this product from a recommendation by a friend.  It turns out that when the fungus first starts to itch, which will itch intensely and constantly, will not respond to anything and it will intensify. Very frightening the first time it happened to me. Spraying this product on it as soon as the itching begins stops it in it&#x27;s tracks.  If you are enduring anything that even resembles what I am explaining, it will be worth it for you to give this a try.  The cost seems like a lot, but in the end the relief and knowing that there is a solution is worth a lot.  I keep this on hand at all times.  I suppose any product with camphor/menthol will work as those seem to be the two ingredients that make the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kool n Fit for years. Nothing else comes close for quick pain relief. It&#x27;s great for sports injuries, arthritis and every day pains, pulls and strains.</li>
            <li> This is our 3rd purschase of Fit and Kool. No balm, rub or spray works as well as this. Sore backs. arthritis stiffness,knots in neck or sholders... spray it on rub it in a little and the pain is gone so fast .I ask you just give it a try you should be as pleased as we are</li>
            <li> order for my brother and he feels relief.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product and kept it for a while without using it. Then I started getting pain in my hip for which an MRI was essentially negative. I decided to use Kool N Fit and was thoroughly amazed at the results. My pain went away, then my neck started hurting and I used up my sample, so I had to research it and order it. This will be a permanent item in my house now and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 25 years and swear by it!!  I spray my feet down before putting on socks and shoes and my feet are NEVER tired!!  When I played baseball used it on my shoulder before games to help with throwing! I will use this product forever!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic in a bottle, spray it on and instantly you feel relief. May be a little costly but well worth it.</li>
            <li> good product, satisfied, useful for pain relief of back pain and shoulder pain. I would recommend this product for minor pain relief.</li>
            <li> A capful of this stuff in a warm bath and in 20 minutes - nothing hurts anymore for hours!</li>
            <li> Great product and dependable supplier</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Only available in the States.</li>
