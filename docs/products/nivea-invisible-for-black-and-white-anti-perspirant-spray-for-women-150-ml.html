            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>This deo is perfect for the winter because you can wear your long-sleeves without white/yellow marks in the armpit area.</li>
            <li>you happen to get this spray on your hands, it&#x27;s also an incredible pain to wash off.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Will reccommend to my girlfriends Great</li>
            <li>It smells great, sprays invisible, never leaves a mark on my clothes, and lasts all day - even after the gym.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and I will continue to use it because it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>This spray is amazing!</li>
            <li>It smells good and it truly does not leave marks on clothing.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, works well!</li>
            <li>&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, she really liked this.</li>
            <li>Great product, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, not too overwhelming like many deodorants today.</li>
            <li>the clinical stuff from secret,dove and degree from the drug store work sooo much better.</li>
            <li>Thsi is okay</li>
            <li>Smells good, keeps me fresh and sweat-free all day.</li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave marks-</li>
            <li>I love this deo.</li>
            <li>If I get any skin irritation I will update my review surely.</li>
            <li>This deodorant truly does not stain your clothes like most deodorants use.</li>
            <li>because I (to the detriment of everyone around me) get super stinky pits even though I&#x27;m a healthy person</li>
            <li>These is a great product, I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>From the look of the packaging and the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; description I hoped that it would be fragrance free</li>
            <li>Smells like cheap perfume</li>
            <li>It is invisible in the pits with a light scent that dries quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like soapy or too much chemical kind of smell in deodorants and this one is exactly like that.</li>
            <li>But so far, i like the smell best of any other deodorants I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The process went smoothly and the product was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>lost long for more then 24hrs, leaves no white stains in clothing, smells great</li>
            <li>Wish if this had little floral smell....not happy</li>
            <li>before using it, i always apply the salt crystal deodorant stick fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is also A LOT more effective than the really strong deodorants like secret clinical and easier to wash off in the shower too...</li>
            <li>No stains as promised, not expensive and was sent super fast.</li>
            <li>there are so many other nivea products available but not this.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a bit less effective when you&#x27;re in super hot weather-</li>
            <li>Definitely use Roll on in the summer as it is thicker and better coverage.  </li>
            <li>Surely doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on skin or cloths.</li>
            <li>It provides decent protection for a someone engaged in mild activity, BUT if you sweat profusely this deodorant may not be the one for you.</li>
            <li>Not so good and not long lasting at all</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Really like this.  </li>
            <li>Not as cheap as usual, but worth it!</li>
            <li>I admit that I am very sensitive to smells, and this was way too much for me.</li>
            <li>ANYWAY- I got hooked on these in Europe (I was able to find them everywhere in Italy, Bulgaria and the UK, to name a few places)</li>
            <li>I used to use the Roll on of this same exact Brand/scent</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t like the fragance ,smells little bite strong for me</li>
            <li>It smells good, not very strong but really long lasting.</li>
            <li>I feel that my underarms sweat more than the average female.</li>
            <li>and this was the first deodorant that worked on me and didn&#x27;t wear off for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have used this deo on skin directly and on cloths too, no problem so far.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the deo I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this deodorant after reading all the great reviews and am sad to say it&#x27;s been a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other spray deodorant  or last that long.</li>
            <li>I build a tolerance to deodorant after a month, so I&#x27;m constantly buying a new one.</li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t be due to the aerosol itself because there are plenty on the market that are pretty ineffective.  </li>
            <li>I try to stay away from chemicals in my deodorant, but sometimes I need something more covenient &amp; less messy than my natural cream deodorant.</li>
            <li>I generally dnt use deo sprays on skin as I get itching sensation.</li>
            <li>It really is the only deodorant that i can put on a black shirt</li>
            <li>Does not come off on black clothes, does not stain white, however does not deliver that much wetness protection.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> rubbing with a wet hand</li>

            <li> The only drawback is the cloud that lingers for a few minutes after I spray it.</li>
            <li> With regular deodorant, I can usually just run a wet hand over whatever I&#x27;m wearing and remove it.</li>
            <li> and it will not leave even a small white stain.</li>
            <li> First of all it is difficult to get a deodorant spray for women in US, I dnt know why.</li>
            <li> then after I have cooled down and getting dressed</li>
            <li> there is ZERO trace of them (and I wear black a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Before this, the only product that semi-worked for me was Secret Clinical strength.</li>
            <li> I spray it directly to a black fabric, no stains at all!</li>
            <li> for some reason the nivea spray deodorants are reeeeeeeally difficult to hunt down and purchase here in the US.  </li>
            <li> too bad the smell is a little bit bitter</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick but the product is terrible .with</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s the winter time but not good protection of all.</li>
            <li> but the price isn&#x27;t too bad here</li>
            <li> very bad smell and its worst nivea experince i ever had.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s not actually an antiperspirant and deodorant, but rather just antiperspirant.  I know the combo product exists b/c I&#x27;ve purchased it overseas before.  The combo product is shown in the image, but is not the product you receive.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, not too overwhelming like many deodorants today. before using it, i always apply the salt crystal deodorant stick fresh out of the shower. this seems to work best for me.. then after I have cooled down and getting dressed i apply the nivea invisible. only problem is the spray doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as reg deodorant solid. But so far, i like the smell best of any other deodorants I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028PXXY/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like the fragance ,smells little bite strong for me,it&#x27;s the winter time but not good protection of all.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this deodorant after reading all the great reviews and am sad to say it&#x27;s been a huge disappointment. It&#x27;s by no means invisible - the spray leaves white residue which is even harder to get off clothes than regular deodorant. With regular deodorant, I can usually just run a wet hand over whatever I&#x27;m wearing and remove it. With this Nivea spray, no amount of wiping/rubbing with a wet hand helped - I just had to throw clothes in the laundry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to get this spray on your hands, it&#x27;s also an incredible pain to wash off. I literally had to wash my hands several times and was still left with a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> sprays well i like it</li>
            <li> the clinical stuff from secret,dove and degree from the drug store work sooo much better. Thsi is okay but it doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other spray deodorant  or last that long.</li>
            <li> These is a great product, I totally recommend it. lost long for more then 24hrs, leaves no white stains in clothing, smells great</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick but the product is terrible .with very bad smell and its worst nivea experince i ever had. It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I feel that my underarms sweat more than the average female. Before this, the only product that semi-worked for me was Secret Clinical strength. I would put it on before bed and again after my shower each morning, being careful to not get the creamy formula on my clothing. Even then I would still have to reapply during the day (I keep a solid stick in my drawer at work). This spray is amazing! It smells good and it truly does not leave marks on clothing. I even sprayed it directly onto a black shirt and rubbed it in - no marks at all. The only drawback is the cloud that lingers for a few minutes after I spray it. I have to leave the bathroom so I can breathe. But for a product that finally works for me I can get over that.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It smells great and it gets the job done.  Will reccommend to my girlfriends Great</li>
            <li> I try to stay away from chemicals in my deodorant, but sometimes I need something more covenient &amp; less messy than my natural cream deodorant. This is it. This is the best product of it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty sweaty person and absolutely hate having wet pits, so I was excited to try this spray deodorant as a friend recommended spray deodorants. From the look of the packaging and the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; description I hoped that it would be fragrance free but I was incorrect in that assumption. I admit that I am very sensitive to smells, and this was way too much for me. The smell was so overpowering that it began to give me a headache and I had to both shower and wash the shirt that I was wearing. I didn&#x27;t have a chance to experience whether or not it works well for sweaty pits. I am writing this review specifically because I wish this review had been there before I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she really liked this.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It works well and doesn&#x27;t show up on cloths.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, works well! I used to use the Roll on of this same exact Brand/scent but I switched to spray for winter because it&#x27;s lighter.  Definitely use Roll on in the summer as it is thicker and better coverage.  Wish I could find Nivea deodorant locally but the price isn&#x27;t too bad here so I&#x27;ll keep buying as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly what I wanted. Smells good, keeps me fresh and sweat-free all day. No stains as promised, not expensive and was sent super fast. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the US doesn&#x27;t have spray deodorant! Not as cheap as usual, but worth it! When I use this deodorant I don&#x27;t notice it (which is what I want!)</li>
            <li> for some reason the nivea spray deodorants are reeeeeeeally difficult to hunt down and purchase here in the US.  there are so many other nivea products available but not this.  (the dove aerosol deodorants too). it can&#x27;t be due to the aerosol itself because there are plenty on the market that are pretty ineffective.  but, I digress. ANYWAY- I got hooked on these in Europe (I was able to find them everywhere in Italy, Bulgaria and the UK, to name a few places) because I (to the detriment of everyone around me) get super stinky pits even though I&#x27;m a healthy person and this was the first deodorant that worked on me and didn&#x27;t wear off for a long time.  the only downsides are that it takes a bit longer to dry and it&#x27;s a bit less effective when you&#x27;re in super hot weather- but what deo isn&#x27;t? I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave marks- there is ZERO trace of them (and I wear black a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is also A LOT more effective than the really strong deodorants like secret clinical and easier to wash off in the shower too...</li>
            <li> I spray it directly to a black fabric, no stains at all! And my brother who introduced it to me, use the male version and he doesn&#x27;t have yellow stains in his white undershirts.</li>
            <li> Smells like cheap perfume</li>
            <li> works incredibly great! I even use it on color clothes. too bad the smell is a little bit bitter but you get used to it eventually.</li>
            <li> The process went smoothly and the product was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I build a tolerance to deodorant after a month, so I&#x27;m constantly buying a new one. This spray is perfect. It smells great, sprays invisible, never leaves a mark on my clothes, and lasts all day - even after the gym. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave marks if you follow the instructions. Pricey but essential product for summer black sleeveless outfits. A must have.</li>
            <li> Works great! No burning and no white streaks!</li>
            <li> Really like this.  It really is the only deodorant that i can put on a black shirt and it will not leave even a small white stain.</li>
            <li> Not so good and not long lasting at all</li>
            <li> I love this deo. First of all it is difficult to get a deodorant spray for women in US, I dnt know why. It smells good, not very strong but really long lasting. Surely doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on skin or cloths. I generally dnt use deo sprays on skin as I get itching sensation. So I use it on the cloths. I have used this deo on skin directly and on cloths too, no problem so far. If I get any skin irritation I will update my review surely. So far, this is the deo I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I will continue to use it because it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. However, it doesn&#x27;t give the 48hr anti- perspiration protection.</li>
            <li> This deodorant truly does not stain your clothes like most deodorants use. This deo is perfect for the winter because you can wear your long-sleeves without white/yellow marks in the armpit area. It is invisible in the pits with a light scent that dries quickly into your skin. It provides decent protection for a someone engaged in mild activity, BUT if you sweat profusely this deodorant may not be the one for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like soapy or too much chemical kind of smell in deodorants and this one is exactly like that. Wish if this had little floral smell....not happy</li>
            <li> Does not come off on black clothes, does not stain white, however does not deliver that much wetness protection.</li>
