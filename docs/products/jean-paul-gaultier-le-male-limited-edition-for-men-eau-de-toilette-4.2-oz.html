            <li>Perfect present for your main man!</li>
            <li>I am constantly receiving great feedback of the smell.</li>
            <li>Very rarely will you wear it and have someone ask you what you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li>Original manufacture of the cologne.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!  </li>
            <li>If you want an amazing smelling, longggggg lasting cologne that everyone will love, look no further!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this fragrance for 15 years, but this is a special edition of Le male JPG in a flask type bottle, very suitable for travel purposes, also with  very reasonable price and shipping expense, love it, delivered before time limits...</li>
            <li>I love the cologne, so I decided to buy a classy flask one.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>#34;where are the cookies.&amp;#34;  My wife enjoys it very much and asks that I wear it on date night.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>The fragrance does not last more than 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li>will purchase my fragances where I can sample them and determine if it is the real thing or bogus!</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Classic mens fragrance!</li>
            <li>It is a very welcomed change from the torso that everyone has seen a thousand times.</li>
            <li>The size of the bottle and the Price were very convenience</li>
            <li>And since we travel a lot, we&#x27;ve always had to just forego his cologne since it wasn&#x27;t very travel-friendly</li>
            <li>thanks to seller...</li>
            <li>I do not feel that this is the real JPG.</li>
            <li>A real plus for my wife.</li>
            <li>Nice everyday smell.</li>
            <li>you can correct by hand, smells nice and long lasting stuff..</li>
            <li>This cologne smells EXACTLY the same, and it has pre-attached to it this handy little stopper that prevents the cologne from being sprayed accidentally, or while in transit.</li>
            <li>it seems that the smells kind weaker than usual, I have used regular version for about 10+ yrs</li>
            <li>Has a soft warming smell that brings you in.</li>
            <li>After spraying a touch on my 4 year old son walked in and said &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought bottles of Le Male several times and this was the first time I&#x27;ve bought it in the flask edition.</li>
            <li>Light Fragrance not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Can was dented when it arrived but other than that, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>(unless we wanted to take the large round soup-can holder it initially came in).</li>

            <li> customer &#x27;s service was excellent but I don&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li> What is there to say about this cologne that hasn&#x27;t been said 100 times before. Everyone knows what this smells like. Very rarely will you wear it and have someone ask you what you&#x27;re wearing. That being said, this ALWAYS gets compliments from women and every girl I&#x27;ve ever met while wearing this LOVED the scent. If you&#x27;re looking for originality, this isn&#x27;t for you. If you want an amazing smelling, longggggg lasting cologne that everyone will love, look no further!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought bottles of Le Male several times and this was the first time I&#x27;ve bought it in the flask edition. It looks good on the shelf and has a very classy look. It is a very welcomed change from the torso that everyone has seen a thousand times.</li>

            <li> The best perfume for guys. I just love this scent. The flask looks really cool and the price is just great. Can´t go wrong with that. Perfect present for your main man!</li>
            <li> Absolutely a wonderful scent. Has that timeless smell that you never get tired of. This scent will be a part of my collection for life. I also love the bottle and tin that I received. Has a soft warming smell that brings you in. My wife gets a little closer when I wear this.</li>
            <li> I really love the package and the bottle of the perfum. It was nicely packed. and of course the fragance was what I expect. The size of the bottle and the Price were very convenience</li>
            <li> it seems that the smells kind weaker than usual, I have used regular version for about 10+ yrs but this one seem to be weaker.</li>
            <li> amazing product LOVE IT</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite cologne (and my favorite on him) has always been Jean Paul Gaultier for Men.

            <li> So glad I took the opportunity to purchase this online. It is as I expected for less than retail. My husband loves this scent. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smells awful! I think the manufacturer made a mistake, smells nothing like it should. Thank goodness it&#x27;s a limited edition! Returned to amazon minutes after receiving! I wish there was an option for negative stars.</li>
            <li> After spraying a touch on my 4 year old son walked in and said &amp;#34;where are the cookies.&amp;#34;  My wife enjoys it very much and asks that I wear it on date night.</li>

            <li> Nice everyday smell. Only 2 sprays is needed.</li>

            <li> Oh the women loves this stuff, get genuine compliments all the time! I might actually have to start dating again!&lt;br /&gt;I could bath in this stuff, but alas there is also the Gel Douche of the same fragrance, but damn is THAT expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Just paid $37 for the body wash.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much. Product is packaged and described exactly as I expected and without disappointment.</li>
            <li> I do not feel that this is the real JPG.

            <li> Item was exactly as described. Original manufacture of the cologne. Perfect I will order this again!! Thank you !!</li>
            <li> I wish this was the only bottle style. The spray bottle tip is always breaking.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice.  Good for any occasion in my opinion.  Definitely worth the money!  Girlfriend loves it.</li>
