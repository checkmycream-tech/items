    <ol>
            <li>This goes on all over or just on the spots that need it, and it looks flawless and invisible.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dreaming of a perfect makeup like this for years.</li>
            <li>This is the best cover-up around.</li>
            <li>I am very happy.</li>
            <li>am very happy of writing this review.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>so I can make the best choice for what I&#x27;m about to buy.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that the sponge isn&#x27;t the greatest</li>
            <li>However, when you dot it on your face, and then use circular motions to put it on, it goes on great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best foundation I have ever used.</li>
            <li>All good!</li>
            <li>While no product is perfect, I&#x27;ve found that this is the closest thing to perfection: it doesn&#x27;t settle in the lines, it does a good job of covering up pores, and my skin feels moist all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, great price.</li>
            <li>I often dont use the applicator it comes with, it is the formula itself that is so great.</li>
            <li>and I think any skin tone should be able to find the perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this makeup, and I have worn the best....</li>
            <li>perfect color for me and easy to use</li>
            <li>It is a good coverup.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth &amp; perfect coverage.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>and I loved it ..</li>
            <li>Good have used a darker color.  </li>
            <li>but it dries quick for a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, all I can say is, I&#x27;m extremely happy to be able to be \\&quot;girly\\&quot; again! :)</li>
            <li>Love that it has anti-aging properties !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic, you put it on and your poors, lines and any imperfections go away, yup it erases everything!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love and protect me from the sun!</li>
            <li>If you use them, this one&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I take good care of my skin that is supple and moist most of the days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think they do more damage than good .</li>
            <li>I love this product-glowing color, nice blend, feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>The eraser tip is soft, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for \\&quot;erasing\\&quot; around the nose or eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love the age rewind line and am thrilled to be able to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>great no makeup look... covers ALL kinds of blemishes and lines... goes on easily and stays true.  </li>
            <li>I have to use a powder over top of this to cover the spots.  </li>
            <li>and I do love the finish.</li>
            <li>Incidentally, this foundation has many many shades</li>
            <li>At the end of the day my skin still looks healthy and hydrated and</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>sure I&#x27;d suggest powder over it</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I doubt this is the product per se, but more my aversion to liquid foundations.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product, it does everything it says it will.</li>
            <li>I mostly like it because of the packaging.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>I saw an ad for this product on tv, and decided to try one more time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>would love to find it again..</li>
            <li>These two colors match my skin tone better then</li>
            <li>It goes on real smooth and is excellent coverage for dark spots.</li>
            <li>And my fine lines do look a bit better with this makeup on.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to get another that works just fine</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product because it is excellent and very affordable.</li>
            <li>Easy to order from amazon.</li>
            <li>I do like the sponge applicator which makes it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It spread easily and uniformly giving glow to the skin without being dewey.</li>
            <li>I think it will be fine, but I would hesitate to use it in the heat of summer.  </li>
            <li>A great buy, especially if you can get a buy one get one 50% off...wish the drugstore products though would use a pump to keep it cleaner.</li>
            <li>, I decided to try another product from a different line with which I am extremely happy.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and really covers flaws, such as spots from the sun.  </li>
            <li>its a good makeup just would like to find that old stuff</li>
            <li>I love it, the price is right and no shipping charge.</li>
            <li>( Think I will stick to Revlon&#x27;s Photo finish make up, holds up better in hot weather.</li>
            <li>This foundation is very sheer and natural looking, yet covers perfectly.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I didn&#x27;t and completed the application.  </li>
            <li>so I initialy put it on with the sponge since it&#x27;s the only way it will come out, but I did the finishing touches with my own foundation brush not a big deal at all and so worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>I have not yet tried it when it is very hot</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in covering fine lines and wrinkles, however I do like the fact that it has SPF 18.  </li>
            <li>The Honey is too golden yellow.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I hope it will be useful and that Maybelline will continue making this foundation forever.</li>
            <li>I got it pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Ship right to the door.</li>
            <li>I lucked into the right shade.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other brands I&#x27;m using, it was ok, but I kept having trouble with it going into lines a bit more than some brands that don&#x27;t claim to do any kind of &amp;#34;age rewind&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually hard to match, color-wise, but they had a great range of colors, and I used the \\&quot;color advisor\\</li>
            <li>Because of the mixed reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would get when I ordered the product.  </li>
            <li>: The sponge applicator is anti-bacterial; no oily foundation breakouts in 3 mos+ since I&#x27;ve been using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to be 100% honest--I use a primer first, which I know helps to keep oiliness at bay.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I will keep using it until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li>first time i applied it, it lioked and felt funny</li>
            <li>The first time I wore the makeup to work, I got compliments all day.</li>
            <li>Oh, and don&#x27;t share, not sanitary, make sure to hide from teenage daughter.</li>
            <li>I live in California and it can get very hot during the summer</li>
            <li>This has an odd, mousse like consistency, but thats ok because it works!</li>
            <li>though - the sponge is just an applicator to me (and the suggestion of a smaller one on the other end is great).</li>
            <li>Instead of getting that cakey look, I look fresh and clean and younger.  </li>
            <li>The foundation spreads easily and uniformly and it settles to its final appearance almost immediately after application.</li>
            <li>For summer I just bought shade 250 (pure beige) which is a lot darker</li>
            <li>It does not dry the skin and, very important for working women, stays put for an entire day looking fresh after 12 hours in the office.</li>
            <li>It does not cake and it does not settle into deep or fine lines not even after 12 hours.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine lines, very deep laughing lines and frowing lines.</li>
            <li>but it should work fine in the middle of summer.</li>
            <li>It goes on very evenly and stays on throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and it really does.</li>
            <li>Really tug on my under eye area.</li>
            <li>The real test was how it settles on the skin as the day wears on.</li>
            <li>My solution (since, again, I don&#x27;t like to wear much makeup)</li>
            <li>Make sure to only use on clean, dry, moisturized skin and wipe sponge of excess after each use.</li>
            <li>It is not cakey, does not make my skin look dry, covers very well including pores and does not sink into fine lines.</li>
            <li>Mixed with Hard candy Glow Bronzer and Oil of Olay Total Effects I get flawless looking skin every time.</li>
            <li>My skin had changed, and I couldn&#x27;t find something that didn&#x27;t make my skin look dry, flaky, or that didn&#x27;t settle into my pores or the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>wonderful works as well as the very expensive undereye concealers</li>
            <li>OK, the applicator can be a bit odd, and it does leave sponge marks at times.  </li>
            <li>I bought this make up with some high expectations, after reading rave reviews.</li>
            <li>My current favorite foundation is Philosophy&#x27;s Supernatural, but in the fall and winter, mineral foundation looks too dry on my 41-year-old skin.</li>
            <li>Several women asked me what I was wearing, and a couple commented that my skin looked \\&quot;fresh and dewey.\\</li>
            <li>I love using this product as part of my everyday makeup routine.</li>
            <li>You can also clean sponge with makeup brush clothes or unscented baby wipes- let dry completely before reuse.</li>
            <li>In a matter of 1 minute my foundation is on and my red or brown blotches are gone all day long unless I plan on going out to an evening function which is an easy fix to reapply my makeup again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say that it has light coverage as it did not cover my dark spots.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin, and it was far too oily looking.</li>
            <li>Although it is a little greasy, it does rub in quite easily.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t settle in creases, invisible, skin look radiant and natural...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive but we&#x27;re talking RASH here, and clogged oil, the works.</li>
            <li>It is so natural looking, blends well and has no fragrance(I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of fragrances).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a perfect base.</li>
            <li>I encourage any middle aged women or any one concerned with caking of foundation in fine lines or deep expression lines to give this foundation a try.</li>
            <li>I also have a few red capillaries on my face near my nostrils, and the coverage is fantastic, without looking cakey.  </li>
            <li>is just to give the top a little twist, do some wide swipes to deposit a nominal amount, and blend with my fingers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to compare the colors with the samples online, I really should have gotten a lighter color, but this is ok to use when I have sunless tanner on.</li>
            <li>As other people have mentioned this foundation can be quite greasy feeling when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be better or equal to the expensive foundations of many prestigious brands, including Chanrl, Givenchy, Estée Lauder, MUFE to mention a few that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin now, so the flakiness was a real issue.  </li>
            <li>skin is currently (since I got older) normal leaning toward dry, but it is not dry yet.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I NEVER right reviews, but I read them all, I spend hours reading everything</li>
            <li>I mix it with use of Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>and then I would buy a makeup that advertised that it fixed all of the things above, and frankly, they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The 1/4 inch is a few days worth of makeup for me that is money out the window.</li>
            <li>Starting with the applicator \\&quot;delivery system\\&quot;: at first it seemed a little strange; you twist the top and suddenly see these little beads of product pop up.</li>
            <li>I am looking for the old maybelline moisture whip foundation does anyone around my age remember that..when I was younger this was the only foundation I wore</li>
            <li>This makeup makes my skin look moist, not dry.</li>
            <li>I need that moisture on my dry mature skin</li>
            <li>I have a problem with broken capillaries around my nose, and I can easily erase them away with this product.</li>
            <li>Usually I just brush on a little light powder, because most makeups look a little heavy for me.  </li>

            <li> : The sponge applicator is anti-bacterial; no oily foundation breakouts in 3 mos+ since I&#x27;ve been using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to be 100% honest--I use a primer first, which I know helps to keep oiliness at bay.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I will keep using it until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li> first time i applied it, it lioked and felt funny</li>
            <li> The first time I wore the makeup to work, I got compliments all day.</li>
            <li> Oh, and don&#x27;t share, not sanitary, make sure to hide from teenage daughter.</li>
            <li> I live in California and it can get very hot during the summer</li>
            <li> This has an odd, mousse like consistency, but thats ok because it works!</li>
            <li> though - the sponge is just an applicator to me (and the suggestion of a smaller one on the other end is great).</li>
            <li> Instead of getting that cakey look, I look fresh and clean and younger.  </li>
            <li> The foundation spreads easily and uniformly and it settles to its final appearance almost immediately after application.</li>
            <li> For summer I just bought shade 250 (pure beige) which is a lot darker</li>
            <li> It does not dry the skin and, very important for working women, stays put for an entire day looking fresh after 12 hours in the office.</li>
            <li> It does not cake and it does not settle into deep or fine lines not even after 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine lines, very deep laughing lines and frowing lines.</li>
            <li> but it should work fine in the middle of summer.</li>
            <li> It goes on very evenly and stays on throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and it really does.</li>
            <li> Really tug on my under eye area.</li>
            <li> The real test was how it settles on the skin as the day wears on.</li>
            <li> My solution (since, again, I don&#x27;t like to wear much makeup)</li>
            <li> Make sure to only use on clean, dry, moisturized skin and wipe sponge of excess after each use.</li>
            <li> It is not cakey, does not make my skin look dry, covers very well including pores and does not sink into fine lines.</li>
            <li> Mixed with Hard candy Glow Bronzer and Oil of Olay Total Effects I get flawless looking skin every time.</li>
            <li> My skin had changed, and I couldn&#x27;t find something that didn&#x27;t make my skin look dry, flaky, or that didn&#x27;t settle into my pores or the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> wonderful works as well as the very expensive undereye concealers</li>
            <li> OK, the applicator can be a bit odd, and it does leave sponge marks at times.  </li>
            <li> I bought this make up with some high expectations, after reading rave reviews.</li>
            <li> My current favorite foundation is Philosophy&#x27;s Supernatural, but in the fall and winter, mineral foundation looks too dry on my 41-year-old skin.</li>
            <li> Several women asked me what I was wearing, and a couple commented that my skin looked \\&quot;fresh and dewey.\\</li>
            <li> I love using this product as part of my everyday makeup routine.</li>
            <li> You can also clean sponge with makeup brush clothes or unscented baby wipes- let dry completely before reuse.</li>
            <li> In a matter of 1 minute my foundation is on and my red or brown blotches are gone all day long unless I plan on going out to an evening function which is an easy fix to reapply my makeup again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say that it has light coverage as it did not cover my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin, and it was far too oily looking.</li>
            <li> Although it is a little greasy, it does rub in quite easily.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t settle in creases, invisible, skin look radiant and natural...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive but we&#x27;re talking RASH here, and clogged oil, the works.</li>
            <li> It is so natural looking, blends well and has no fragrance(I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of fragrances).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a perfect base.</li>
            <li> I encourage any middle aged women or any one concerned with caking of foundation in fine lines or deep expression lines to give this foundation a try.</li>
            <li> I also have a few red capillaries on my face near my nostrils, and the coverage is fantastic, without looking cakey.  </li>
            <li> is just to give the top a little twist, do some wide swipes to deposit a nominal amount, and blend with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to compare the colors with the samples online, I really should have gotten a lighter color, but this is ok to use when I have sunless tanner on.</li>
            <li> As other people have mentioned this foundation can be quite greasy feeling when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be better or equal to the expensive foundations of many prestigious brands, including Chanrl, Givenchy, Estée Lauder, MUFE to mention a few that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin now, so the flakiness was a real issue.  </li>
            <li> skin is currently (since I got older) normal leaning toward dry, but it is not dry yet.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I NEVER right reviews, but I read them all, I spend hours reading everything</li>
            <li> I mix it with use of Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> and then I would buy a makeup that advertised that it fixed all of the things above, and frankly, they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The 1/4 inch is a few days worth of makeup for me that is money out the window.</li>
            <li> Starting with the applicator \\&quot;delivery system\\&quot;: at first it seemed a little strange; you twist the top and suddenly see these little beads of product pop up.</li>
            <li> I am looking for the old maybelline moisture whip foundation does anyone around my age remember that..when I was younger this was the only foundation I wore</li>
            <li> This makeup makes my skin look moist, not dry.</li>
            <li> I need that moisture on my dry mature skin</li>
            <li> I have a problem with broken capillaries around my nose, and I can easily erase them away with this product.</li>
            <li> Usually I just brush on a little light powder, because most makeups look a little heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> The foundation, once applied, did not look any better or worse than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am 49 yrs old with dry skin, sun spots, very few wrinkles and wear the colors buff beige and classic ivory.</li>
            <li> do not wear foundation every day, and because after several months I was not able to remove the applicator to wash (I don&#x27;t care about the antimicrobial properties, I am someone who wants to wash any bateria or debris off)</li>
            <li> That may or may not be related to when I twisted it in the opposite direction after I got off the plane, and it still works fine</li>
            <li> I always saw makeup line streaks which I felt compelled to get rid of with a hand-held spong applicator, so the process of applying with that little soft applicator didn&#x27;t save any time or effort.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to really pick a color for makeup now of days.</li>
            <li> (if I apply the foundation in the afternoon and several hours since applying the moisturizer, I distribute a minimal amount of moisturizer to my face before applying the foundation).</li>
            <li> My makeup will last all day with minimal touch up.</li>
            <li> I also like that you can see how much product is left in the bottle, and the way it has a sort of round disc inside that pushes the product down and out, so you get to use every last drop of it; nothing goes to waste.  </li>
            <li> At 41, my skin can look dry and lacks that glow it once had.</li>
            <li> I do not have major problems and neither need nor like heavy foundations.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and everything else makes my face look so dry and flaky, but not the eraser!</li>
            <li> It goes on sheer, but covers the faint shadows near the bridge of my nose and brightens up the entire under eye area--and it gets the job done without settling into my fine lines or looking fake or cakey.</li>
            <li> It may look too wet.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a mineral makeup \\&quot;eraser\\&quot; on the other end--like a pencil with two erasers--to set the makeup and also to touch up blemishes.</li>
            <li> (FYI-I have dry, over-40, pale skin, and this works for me.)</li>
            <li> But for average of 8 to 9 bucks on a monthly basis is adds up.</li>
            <li> One, if you take it on a plane, it will bubble up like you twisted it a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> use shade 120 (creamy yvory) which is slightly paler than I am, but the difference is not noticeble once I have done</li>
            <li> classic foundation brush (from Essence of Beauty, nothing expensive).</li>
            <li> once you find your color, you&#x27;ll be amazed at the difference a little bit of this can make.</li>
            <li> Rubbing the foundation around on the face, despite a little or a lot, does not create a finished look.</li>
            <li> I have tried other foundations that were less greasy, but were really hard to blend.</li>
            <li> On the con side, if you wear a heavy moisturizer or have oily skin, you might not like how moist this makeup is.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these and have no idea why .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always disliked liquid foundation (a lot!)...  </li>
            <li> (A few of my friends complained it felt \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; but they don&#x27;t use primer).</li>
            <li> usually get buff beige or nude.</li>
            <li> I use a makeup sponge to pat makeup in the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> any other foundation I have tried including the very expensive like MUFE HD foundation.</li>
            <li> I am unable to use, it sits at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I never use setting powder because I hate the feeling, but the foundation does not need it (at least for my skin type).  </li>
            <li> BAD.</li>
            <li> REALLY BAD.</li>
            <li> I never have to get my hands dirty!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I shop around for this product and find that online is cheaper then going to the store. I got it pretty quick. Easy to order from amazon. Ship right to the door.</li>
            <li> Because of the mixed reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would get when I ordered the product.  I&#x27;m really happy with it.  I lucked into the right shade.  I use the applicator to apply dots around my face, then use my fingers to blend.  It goes on very evenly and stays on throughout the day.  I&#x27;ve even used it as an under-eye cover--once blended, it doesn&#x27;t cake into my eye-wrinkles.  It also seems to add a bit of luster to my face.  I like it so much, I&#x27;ve bought another one to keep in my purse for touch ups.  (FYI-I have dry, over-40, pale skin, and this works for me.)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop raving about this makeup, and I&#x27;ve tried everything out there--all of the mineral foundations and department store foundations. My current favorite foundation is Philosophy&#x27;s Supernatural, but in the fall and winter, mineral foundation looks too dry on my 41-year-old skin. Here are the pros and cons of this foundation:  1. I never have to get my hands dirty! This goes on all over or just on the spots that need it, and it looks flawless and invisible. I can touch up this foundation in seconds in the rearview mirror. The eraser tip is soft, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for \\&quot;erasing\\&quot; around the nose or eyes.  2. This foundation is very sheer and natural looking, yet covers perfectly. Instead of getting that cakey look, I look fresh and clean and younger.  3. It gets the red out. In fact, I didn&#x27;t realize how red my skin was until I used this makeup. I have a problem with broken capillaries around my nose, and I can easily erase them away with this product. On the con side, it doesn&#x27;t cover age spots quite as well as it covers red spots.  4. It works perfectly around the eyes. It goes on sheer, but covers the faint shadows near the bridge of my nose and brightens up the entire under eye area--and it gets the job done without settling into my fine lines or looking fake or cakey. And my fine lines do look a bit better with this makeup on.  5. This foundation is moist and dewy. At 41, my skin can look dry and lacks that glow it once had. This makeup makes my skin look moist, not dry. On the con side, if you wear a heavy moisturizer or have oily skin, you might not like how moist this makeup is. It may look too wet. But that&#x27;s the only con!       I&#x27;ve been dreaming of a perfect makeup like this for years. Finally, it&#x27;s here! I just wish it had a mineral makeup \\&quot;eraser\\&quot; on the other end--like a pencil with two erasers--to set the makeup and also to touch up blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always disliked liquid foundation (a lot!)...  getting it on your fingers or clothes, making skin greasy, looking \\&quot;made up/masky\\&quot;..  But this is great.&lt;br /&gt; (look mom, no hands!) You just twist to release some foundation and swipe the sponge tip over your face where you want coverage. You don&#x27;t have to touch it or blend it it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(major coolness too: The sponge applicator is anti-bacterial; no oily foundation breakouts in 3 mos+ since I&#x27;ve been using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to be 100% honest--I use a primer first, which I know helps to keep oiliness at bay.  (A few of my friends complained it felt \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; but they don&#x27;t use primer).</li>
            <li> This is the best cover-up around. It goes on real smooth and is excellent coverage for dark spots. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> As other people have mentioned this foundation can be quite greasy feeling when you first put it on.  Now that it is fall I think it will be fine, but I would hesitate to use it in the heat of summer.  I think it would make my skin too oily.  Although it is a little greasy, it does rub in quite easily.  I have tried other foundations that were less greasy, but were really hard to blend. I would say that it has light coverage as it did not cover my dark spots.  I have to use a powder over top of this to cover the spots.  I do like the sponge applicator which makes it easy to apply.  I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in covering fine lines and wrinkles, however I do like the fact that it has SPF 18.  Overall, I will keep using it until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li> Lets face it we buy products based on claims. Finally a foundation that claims to deliver an end result and it really does. My selection of color is Med.Beige since my skin tone is med/fair. The Honey is too golden yellow.&lt;br /&gt;Love the applicator. Once again finally a product where my fingers are not all covered in makeup. In a matter of 1 minute my foundation is on and my red or brown blotches are gone all day long unless I plan on going out to an evening function which is an easy fix to reapply my makeup again.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with Instant age rewind Eraser is the left over product is approx. 1/4 inch of makeup which I paid for that I am unable to use, it sits at the bottom. As a customer I want to use every last drop. The 1/4 inch is a few days worth of makeup for me that is money out the window. But for average of 8 to 9 bucks on a monthly basis is adds up. Big deal or not, you decide. Yes, I do use about 1 tube which claims to hold .68oz during 30-35 days.&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage, covers red and brown spots and also reduces the appearance of lines. Cant beat it. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I encourage any middle aged women or any one concerned with caking of foundation in fine lines or deep expression lines to give this foundation a try. I find it to be better or equal to the expensive foundations of many prestigious brands, including Chanrl, Givenchy, Estée Lauder, MUFE to mention a few that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;The first time i applied it, it lioked and felt funny and I thought I was going to trash it. Luckily, I didn&#x27;t and completed the application.  It spread easily and uniformly giving glow to the skin without being dewey. It does not dry the skin and, very important for working women, stays put for an entire day looking fresh after 12 hours in the office. It does not cake and it does not settle into deep or fine lines not even after 12 hours. I have not yet tried it when it is very hot and I am sweating. This will be soon however and I have already bought a darker shade.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is currently (since I got older) normal leaning toward dry, but it is not dry yet. I do not have major problems and neither need nor like heavy foundations. I have a lot of fine lines, very deep laughing lines and frowing lines. I take good care of my skin that is supple and moist most of the days.&lt;br /&gt;I use shade 120 (creamy yvory) which is slightly paler than I am, but the difference is not noticeble once I have done and I do love the finish. For summer I just bought shade 250 (pure beige) which is a lot darker then I am but it should work fine in the middle of summer. Incidentally, this foundation has many many shades and I think any skin tone should be able to find the perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it in moderate amount with the sponge applicator it comes with to forehead, cheeks and chin shortly after having applied my moisturizer (if I apply the foundation in the afternoon and several hours since applying the moisturizer, I distribute a minimal amount of moisturizer to my face before applying the foundation). I  distribute it on my face with a big (I have no patience) classic foundation brush (from Essence of Beauty, nothing expensive). The foundation spreads easily and uniformly and it settles to its final appearance almost immediately after application. I never use setting powder because I hate the feeling, but the foundation does not need it (at least for my skin type).  At the end of the day my skin still looks healthy and hydrated and I  neither feel nor look like a prune.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy of writing this review. I hope it will be useful and that Maybelline will continue making this foundation forever.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and really covers flaws, such as spots from the sun.  I love it, the price is right and no shipping charge.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these and have no idea why . I think they do more damage than good . Really tug on my under eye area.</li>
            <li> Not purchased for me! Wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like this product for it&#x27;s anti-aging benefits.  I use it as a primer as it makes it easier to apply my foundation over it.  A great buy, especially if you can get a buy one get one 50% off...wish the drugstore products though would use a pump to keep it cleaner.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say! I love this product-glowing color, nice blend, feels good on my skin. All good!</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands I&#x27;m using, it was ok, but I kept having trouble with it going into lines a bit more than some brands that don&#x27;t claim to do any kind of &amp;#34;age rewind&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s difficult to compare the colors with the samples online, I really should have gotten a lighter color, but this is ok to use when I have sunless tanner on. Won&#x27;t be buying again, will move on to something else.</li>
            <li> great no makeup look... covers ALL kinds of blemishes and lines... goes on easily and stays true.  I have been very happy with this product.  once you find your color, you&#x27;ll be amazed at the difference a little bit of this can make.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin and I love it. Doesn&#x27;t settle in creases, invisible, skin look radiant and natural...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do need my hands to spread it around evenly  though - the sponge is just an applicator to me (and the suggestion of a smaller one on the other end is great). It&#x27;s a bit runny but it dries quick for a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I&#x27;d suggest powder over it (but i no longer need it with this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great price. Go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Skin broke out after 5 days of use. BAD. REALLY BAD. I&#x27;m sensitive but we&#x27;re talking RASH here, and clogged oil, the works. So bummed. HOWEVER, I doubt this is the product per se, but more my aversion to liquid foundations. If you use them, this one&#x27;s amazing. If you can&#x27;t, this one is no exception. ARGH.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for sometime. It is a good coverup. I mix it with use of Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup, and I have worn the best....it feels like velvet going on and lasts all day..they discontinued my color but I was able to get another that works just fine</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth &amp; perfect coverage. Love that it has anti-aging properties !</li>
            <li> Just bought this today and put it on when I got home. First let me say that I NEVER right reviews, but I read them all, I spend hours reading everything so I can make the best choice for what I&#x27;m about to buy. However I just had to take a minute and write something about this. It&#x27;s like magic, you put it on and your poors, lines and any imperfections go away, yup it erases everything! I love, love, love this product, it does everything it says it will. I do have to say that the sponge isn&#x27;t the greatest so I initialy put it on with the sponge since it&#x27;s the only way it will come out, but I did the finishing touches with my own foundation brush not a big deal at all and so worth it!!!! I am 42 and have tried EVERYTHING out there, but this time I may have found \\&quot;the one...\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Good product. I mostly like it because of the packaging. I like the built in applicator.</li>
            <li> I use for years. It is a perfect base.</li>
            <li> This has an odd, mousse like consistency, but thats ok because it works! I have dry skin, and everything else makes my face look so dry and flaky, but not the eraser! I often dont use the applicator it comes with, it is the formula itself that is so great.</li>
            <li> I bought this make up with some high expectations, after reading rave reviews. I was disappointed. I have normal skin, and it was far too oily looking. I live in California and it can get very hot during the summer,this make up(even though it has SPF)just fell apart, I was wearing my make up on my chest, it just melted away!! it was about 90 degrees, there is no way this holds up in 100F weather:( Think I will stick to Revlon&#x27;s Photo finish make up, holds up better in hot weather. P.S the applicator only streaked my face, I had to use my hand too blend, went back to store to return Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Treatment Makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. About 5 years ago, I stopped wearing foundation. My skin had changed, and I couldn&#x27;t find something that didn&#x27;t make my skin look dry, flaky, or that didn&#x27;t settle into my pores or the fine lines around my eyes. I have very dry skin now, so the flakiness was a real issue.  Every now and then I would buy a makeup that advertised that it fixed all of the things above, and frankly, they didn&#x27;t. I saw an ad for this product on tv, and decided to try one more time. I&#x27;m glad that I did. I&#x27;m usually hard to match, color-wise, but they had a great range of colors, and I used the \\&quot;color advisor\\&quot; on the display to select the Sandy Beige color.  Starting with the applicator \\&quot;delivery system\\&quot;: at first it seemed a little strange; you twist the top and suddenly see these little beads of product pop up. When the product comes out, the brush itself sort of looks like a short-haired cat&#x27;s fur when he&#x27;s got his \\&quot;back up.\\&quot; However, when you dot it on your face, and then use circular motions to put it on, it goes on great! I use a makeup sponge to pat makeup in the hard to reach areas. I also like that you can see how much product is left in the bottle, and the way it has a sort of round disc inside that pushes the product down and out, so you get to use every last drop of it; nothing goes to waste.  The real test was how it settles on the skin as the day wears on. While no product is perfect, I&#x27;ve found that this is the closest thing to perfection: it doesn&#x27;t settle in the lines, it does a good job of covering up pores, and my skin feels moist all day. I also have a few red capillaries on my face near my nostrils, and the coverage is fantastic, without looking cakey.  The first time I wore the makeup to work, I got compliments all day. Several women asked me what I was wearing, and a couple commented that my skin looked \\&quot;fresh and dewey.\\&quot;  So, all I can say is, I&#x27;m extremely happy to be able to be \\&quot;girly\\&quot; again! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reviews despite my initial reservation about the permanent applicator. I didn&#x27;t like the fact that I couldn&#x27;t remove it and wash it but it is supposed to have antimicrobial properties. Rubbing the foundation around on the face, despite a little or a lot, does not create a finished look. I always saw makeup line streaks which I felt compelled to get rid of with a hand-held spong applicator, so the process of applying with that little soft applicator didn&#x27;t save any time or effort. The foundation, once applied, did not look any better or worse than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I found the coverage to be fine/enough with repeated swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wear foundation every day, and because after several months I was not able to remove the applicator to wash (I don&#x27;t care about the antimicrobial properties, I am someone who wants to wash any bateria or debris off), I decided to try another product from a different line with which I am extremely happy.</li>
            <li> I love using this product as part of my everyday makeup routine. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love the age rewind line and am thrilled to be able to buy it on Amazon.I have added this to my subscribe and save list.Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of makeup.  Usually I just brush on a little light powder, because most makeups look a little heavy for me.  OK, the applicator can be a bit odd, and it does leave sponge marks at times.  My solution (since, again, I don&#x27;t like to wear much makeup) is just to give the top a little twist, do some wide swipes to deposit a nominal amount, and blend with my fingers.  I don&#x27;t use the sponge-top for blending, I just use it for dispensing.  Two things to note: One, if you take it on a plane, it will bubble up like you twisted it a whole lot.  Maybe twisting it in the opposite direction before getting on the plane would help?  Two, it no longer clicks for me when I twist it.  That may or may not be related to when I twisted it in the opposite direction after I got off the plane, and it still works fine, I just don&#x27;t have the audible signal.</li>
            <li> I am looking for the old maybelline moisture whip foundation does anyone around my age remember that..when I was younger this was the only foundation I wore and I loved it ..they stopped making it or I think someone else took it over. Now that I am almost 50 I need that moisture on my dry mature skin would love to find it again..I bought this thinking it might be similar its a good makeup just would like to find that old stuff</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Mixed with Hard candy Glow Bronzer and Oil of Olay Total Effects I get flawless looking skin every time.</li>
            <li> I use this as a concealer and a foundation. It is so natural looking, blends well and has no fragrance(I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of fragrances).&lt;br /&gt;I usually get buff beige or nude.</li>
            <li> perfect color for me and easy to use</li>
            <li> This is probably the best foundation I have ever used. I am 49 yrs old with dry skin, sun spots, very few wrinkles and wear the colors buff beige and classic ivory. It is not cakey, does not make my skin look dry, covers very well including pores and does not sink into fine lines. These two colors match my skin tone better then any other foundation I have tried including the very expensive like MUFE HD foundation. I use this product then a concealer then a powder. My makeup will last all day with minimal touch up. I highly recommend this product because it is excellent and very affordable. Make sure to only use on clean, dry, moisturized skin and wipe sponge of excess after each use. You can also clean sponge with makeup brush clothes or unscented baby wipes- let dry completely before reuse. These steps will help keep your makeup from causing breakouts, works for me. Oh, and don&#x27;t share, not sanitary, make sure to hide from teenage daughter.</li>
            <li> I love and protect me from the sun!</li>
            <li> Good have used a darker color.  It is so hard to really pick a color for makeup now of days.</li>
            <li> wonderful works as well as the very expensive undereye concealers</li>
