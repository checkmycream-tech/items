            <li>and it has really good pigment</li>
            <li>I have always loved the look of lip gloss but can&#x27;t stand the sticky feeling.</li>

            <li>It is such a great product!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I can put it on and go all day without having to put more on or worried about cracked lips after wearing.</li>
            <li>The color is cute tho.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty good quality lipgloss, it does feel like it melts on your lips</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of NYX</li>
            <li>texture is smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, last for a decent amount of time and great color on the lips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very pigmented, very glossy, good smell and</li>
            <li>The lipstick is cute but it&#x27;s really buttery on my lips.</li>
            <li>the color is super nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rather the super glosses than this one...</li>
            <li>It definitely has good coverage and a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Great quality and can go head to head with more expensive brands like MAC.</li>
            <li>The color is a little bright</li>
            <li>ok cause it will allow you to use over different color lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Its pretty , It is kinda sticky and the color is not for me</li>
            <li>I noticed that it kind of sinks into the creases of my lips, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip gloss!</li>
            <li>I was looking for more of a neutral pink color.</li>
            <li>It is also a much cheaper alternative for m.a.c lip glass, also smells like vanilla</li>
            <li>I would have rather paid a little more to not have the sticker.</li>
            <li>Very soft and buttery on the lips.</li>
            <li>My mom had a lip gloss stick from NYX in a different color and my sister was always using it behind her back, so she decided it was time to get one of her own.</li>

            <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;does the work&lt;br /&gt;Color show its not clear on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stay on ur lips all day but we can&#x27;t have it all... I dont mind to re-apply it on my lips&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty good quality lipgloss, it does feel like it melts on your lips and it has really good pigment</li>
            <li> My little sister purchased this through my account. My mom had a lip gloss stick from NYX in a different color and my sister was always using it behind her back, so she decided it was time to get one of her own. I never see her without this lip gloss; she carries it everywhere and even puts it on while we&#x27;re driving her to lacrosse practice.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the look of lip gloss but can&#x27;t stand the sticky feeling. This stuff is amazing, last for a decent amount of time and great color on the lips.</li>

            <li> Amazing lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;It is very pigmented, very glossy, good smell and the color is super nice.&lt;br /&gt;i will repurchase and buy other colors.</li>
            <li> Very nice texture lip gloss I&#x27;m a huge fan of NYX but this is a little brighter than expected I was looking for more of a neutral pink color. This color would be great for spring or summer though :)</li>
            <li> It is such a great product!! It is also a much cheaper alternative for m.a.c lip glass, also smells like vanilla</li>
            <li> This is lip gloss with a great price and a nice shine!  NYX Butter Lip Gloss has not taste...which is great!  It is also long-lasting.  On the down-side, it has that sticky feel a lot of the lower priced lip glosses have.  It definitely has good coverage and a pretty color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it. It too thick and it doesn&#x27;t stay put long. I rather the super glosses than this one...</li>
            <li> I love all the shades of these butter glosses, they are creamy, pigmented and smell delicious!</li>
            <li> Its pretty , It is kinda sticky and the color is not for me so I gave it to my blonde daughter , she loves it ..</li>
            <li> Love it! Stays on for a long time. Gives a peachy gloss. Once the gloss disappears, it even leaves a little bit of a lip stain. Great quality and can go head to head with more expensive brands like MAC.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time given. Love it. I was concerned about it drying out my lips but I can put it on and go all day without having to put more on or worried about cracked lips after wearing.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is cute but it&#x27;s really buttery on my lips. I noticed that it kind of sinks into the creases of my lips, if that makes sense. The color is cute tho.</li>
            <li> Like this color the best! Smells so good</li>
            <li> I really like this lip gloss! The color is a little bright but I am still happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the butter glosses , nothing bad to say at all</li>
            <li> My lips are extremely dry so I put moisturizing balm then lip liner then lip stick then this gloss and I love! It has great pigmentation. I will be trying other colors in near future</li>
