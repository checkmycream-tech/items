            <li>A wonderful product.</li>
            <li>So it has been my best choice ever since I found out this solution.</li>
            <li>I googled \\&quot;best drugstore</li>
            <li>For best results, stick to using it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>So happy I bought it!</li>
            <li>The hair mask along with the heat from the curling iron locked in the moisture and smoothed the hair shafts out wonderfully.</li>

            <li>so i didn&#x27;t have very good reviews to go by.</li>
            <li>My hair was noticeably shiny, softer and the slip was incredible.</li>
            <li>it is so good!</li>

            <li>I decided to try this product based on the great reviews it had.</li>
            <li>I did use this product on my nieces hair and worked great - she doesn&#x27;t have chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>I will give Neutrogena credit - the hair mask smells great and does work on virgin hair.</li>
            <li>but I hope it works just great for me.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It does a great job for me.</li>
            <li>The difference is that great.</li>
            <li>I read all the great reviews and tried this one.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>which is great given the toll the humidity has been taking on my hair.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is great though.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Feels great</li>

            <li>Best of all, it is way cheaper than most brands.</li>
            <li>I promise! :o)</li>
            <li>Love this product, best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had for my hair.</li>
            <li>this is the best conditioning treatment! :)</li>
            <li>Its perfect in so many ways....</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works very effectively and smells great!</li>
            <li>The smell isnt as pleasant but it works well on my hair.</li>
            <li>: it has a pleasant scent; yet it doesn&#x27;t seem to activate any allergies,</li>
            <li>Not the most moisturizing conditioner I have ever used, but for the price it is very good.</li>
            <li>I have never found a product that worked really good at smoothing my hair out.</li>
            <li>cant be that good?</li>
            <li>I read mainly good reviews about it, so I decided to run over to Target and pick it up.</li>
            <li>It can be used weekly with good results.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome and it leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I just put a good amount on the ends of my hair (never the stop or it will make your scalp greasy)</li>
            <li>I just received the Mask it smells good.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a good conditioner for a lot of people but not for my hair.</li>
            <li>I used this product once and it worked so good</li>
            <li>Some products were good, but nothing as good as this one.</li>
            <li>It was good</li>
            <li>I hope others have as good of luck as I did.</li>
            <li>I take good care of my hair, and I will never put anything Neutrogena on my hair again.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, hair get silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this and the Loreal overnight hair treatment after reading so many great reviews here.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with this product.  </li>

            <li>I have been able to successfully grow my hair now without having to chop it off because the ends are so damaged.</li>
            <li>I overprocessed with a relaxer and then added a semi permanent color on top!  </li>
            <li>in a couple weeks I switched too the recommended once a week treatment and my hair looked and felt so much better!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>

            <li>but it does my hair good :)</li>
            <li>Neutrogena makes great products at reasonable prices, there&#x27;s no need to spend a lot of money for a great conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used and great price.</li>
            <li>Just the kind of slip i like.</li>
            <li>Really does work,,, impressed.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels like it has just had a good haircut - bouncy, healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>In addition, this hair mask is a great alternative to the Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque which is also excellent, but pricey.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best ones I have used, It really works</li>
            <li>I chose this one by the reviews and it really works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this product but my hair didn&#x27;t take to well to it.</li>
            <li>Some are pretty awesome and work just as well as the salon brands, and some drug store brands work even better.</li>
            <li>This must work for many, there are so many good reviews</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super concentrated which is great.  </li>
            <li>i have super curly hair and this help manage it and smells great.</li>
            <li>I have curl hair and it was very easy to untangle after this product.</li>
            <li>hoping to see more progress as I use the product more!</li>
            <li>These are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used !!!</li>
            <li>I  was looking for a good and cheap moisturizing treatment.</li>
            <li>I love the cream and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and perfect</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this, but I do recommend garnier frutis hair mask which smells delicious and makes my hair feel great and cost half the price of this watery stuff.</li>
            <li>Great for right after a bleach job, too.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and am attempting to grow it out.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>good scent and good body, its not sticky and very affordable..</li>
            <li>The conditioning mask is great, but the 6 oz goes fast!  </li>
            <li>oh, and the amount is very huge~</li>
            <li>It felt very smooth washing off</li>
            <li>make hair very smooth and all my friends like this product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is handy, easy to grasp and work with.  </li>
            <li>HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>One for the top of my hair and one for the bottom.</li>
            <li>and it works better than what it said on the jar.</li>
            <li>I hope Neutogena won&#x27;t be skipping on the ingredients too :)</li>
            <li>Eh - its ok.  </li>
            <li>IT SEEMS TO BE OK.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s more like an emergency hair repair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>You have to use it maximum twice a week, any more</li>
            <li>I must say I love it.</li>
            <li>Just order 2 more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would definitely consider this a awesome drugstore find and would repurchase this over.</li>
            <li>I hope that I continue to feel satisfied</li>
            <li>And for the price, you can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>So, saves a ton of money and you get better hair than ever.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love to keep this mask over night.</li>
            <li>:) I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>so I am dying my hair more than I ever have before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>I cover my hair with a shower cap to allow my body heat to help the conditioner penetrate my hair strands better.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I like this product.</li>
            <li>but i found something better.</li>
            <li>I am coloring my hair many years</li>
            <li>I read many reviews about Nutrogena Triple Moisture at the web and Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to all who likes healthy hair, regardless of your race.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was buying an asian leave in conditioner that was awesome.</li>
            <li>It is OK, will not buy again.</li>
            <li>10/10 would do again best deep hair mask that i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>i think it is some thing that many people can</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>favorite part is the winter static</li>
            <li>so glad thats under control now because of this.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product as a deep conditioner and am so impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>I have relaxed color treated hair, I have used many deep conditioners and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>I started my healthy hair journey in March of 2011 and began using it then.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it actually replaced the pantene provene curly series i used to buy... and the best thing is that you dont need to saturate your hair with this stuff to get results</li>
            <li>i am satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>I love this hair mask.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li>As each month passes and my damaged hair is increasingly cut off, my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner</li>
            <li>and I wish it would have worked better for me.  </li>
            <li>My husband noticed it and said, you better check out your hair.  </li>
            <li>Glad it worked for some people.  </li>
            <li>Replaced my regular conditioner with this and after one week my hair is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Great deal, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Im just going to put it out there, and say that this is the best hair mask Ive used in a long time.  </li>
            <li>This Neutrogena is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at my local CVS for $8 and its ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that most reviews are from those with fine hair</li>
            <li>excellent for very dry hair.</li>
            <li>Back then, grocery/drug store brands weren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and worth every penny of the $6 I paid at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, manageable and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>It smell great and provided nice slip on my chemical free kinky African America hair.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair smelling great, feeling soft, and extremely easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Miracle didn&#x27;t happen, but it leaves my hair easy to comb.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use</li>
            <li>I have tested leaving in with another product (Garnier Fructis, Sleek and Shine Conditioner) and had better results, measured by how easily it is to run a comb to smooth the conditioner over my tangled hair and how smooth it is after blow-drying.  </li>
            <li>That was so much cheaper and more effective.     </li>
            <li>My hair stays hydrated and strong and doesn&#x27;t get brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hi all, it has strong fragrance smell.</li>
            <li>Its good, and leaves hair soft, but Morrocan Oil for me is much better.</li>
            <li>It will transform your dry damaged hair into beautiful healthy hair.</li>
            <li>like they were full of static.</li>
            <li>I am 31 yo and my hair has always been fine, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>I pay triple for other top brand masks and this one is just as good!</li>
            <li>Because my hair is fine</li>
            <li>I have fine, overly processed hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s super light!</li>
            <li>Came so quick! &amp; worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>I like to try different hair treatment product, and it is my first time to try Neutrogena&#x27;s hair product, and it is a good experience, good product</li>
            <li>I have used this product for dry fly away hair and repair of color treated hair for many years..</li>
            <li>Amazing, completely fixed my hair after being processed and bleached so many times and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get it to help.</li>
            <li>and I already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>After I shower, I would take a dime sized, smooth it on my hair, and comb to even it out.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light and silky and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>My hair went from looking frizzy, to silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>After shampooing i smooth this all threw out my hair and put a plastic cap on then let it sit for 10 15 minutes  after you wash it out</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I can keep it in my shower and it is readily available.</li>
            <li>how fortunate I was to have found another product that works well and saves me on costs.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this because it was so affordable for a deep conditioner and still had great reviews.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this really inexpensive deep hair mask is the best one.  </li>
            <li>I believe that I can find an equally good deep conditioner with much more.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find it still available as have not found it in stores for a few years...</li>
            <li>Then I used a blow dryer on warm high setting.</li>
            <li>It made my hair super soft and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>My hair just felt more softer, healthier, and it actually looked more voluminous!</li>
            <li>but it is worth the price!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>They might make your hair look fabulous but you absolutely can&#x27;t let anyone touch your beautiful tresses because they feel totally disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will weigh your hair down if you use too much, but if you get the amount correct-it is the perfect mask at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>But there is nothing special or &amp;#34;extra moisturizing&amp;#34; about this stuff at all.</li>
            <li>I found and used this mask and noticed a huge difference the first time I used it!  </li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever left on Amazon about any product, but I decided I HAD to share with my fellow frizz-heads about why this product is so great.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and smells amazing, I do recommend to EVERYONE</li>
            <li>I  have very corase hair that I consider to be type 4b, so I use a lot more that a dime size</li>
            <li>Overall this is a good hair mask.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have always loved this.  </li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and this product feels best on my hair</li>
            <li>but I wear it straight most days, so</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good deep moisturizer and found all the reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>It makes my life full of good-hair day.</li>
            <li>Not a bad choice for when you don&#x27;t want to pay for a salon quality product.</li>
            <li>I have searched long and hard for a good hair mask, and this is definitely an excellent one.</li>
            <li>It works fine at first.  </li>
            <li>Boy I got lucky.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this as a weekly deep conditioner until I find the next best thing that works for my hair.</li>
            <li>The big surprise is I&#x27;ve got the best shine back in my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is super</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair incredibly soft and smooth, removes tangles and knots instantly, and smells great.</li>
            <li>I put this in my coarse like hair from dying my hair so much and it revived my hair back to silky and smooth feeling :D</li>
            <li>Honestly, you will get more than your money&#x27;s worth from this jar of hair mask than any other salon brand on the market.</li>
            <li>It leaves it super soft and super healthy.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (to fragrances mostly) and this doesn&#x27;t break me out at all.  </li>
            <li>I thought okay and was very surprised.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is and moisterizes your hair ridicousely!</li>
            <li>The FIRST time I used it my hair came out the softest I have ever felt it!</li>
            <li>I had tried all kinds of rememdies to fix it to include throwing avacado and mayo on my hair (which turned into a funny profile pic on fb!).</li>
            <li>I like it well enough to use the rest of it, but will be searching for something better for my hair!</li>
            <li>is dry, coarse &amp; frizzy and this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve found for my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair super soft when i deep condition overnight.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair (but I have a lot of it)</li>
            <li>Let me preface this review with the fact that I have fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T REALLY NOTICE A HUGE DIFFERENCE..</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I left it in for 30 mins and my hair felt amazing.</li>
            <li>I have thick 4AB  hair and this stuff is amazing amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and for only 7 dollars it is a steal.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Neutrogena triple moisture for anybody who is looking for a effective inexpensive deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I tried so many but this one left my hair feeling like silk for so so cheap.</li>
            <li>The product is simple to use, does not require the ultimately damaging utilization of a blow dryer, and gives good results: my hair feels as nurtured as when I have used beauty salon products that cost much more.  </li>
            <li>I will never use another kind of Deep Conditoner!</li>
            <li>the return on your investment is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>If I had not paid $7 and instead bought it from the $1 store then I would say it was worth the dollar.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>but bottom line, it leaves my hair feeling healthy and really soft...</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and healthy, and the effect lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>During the summer I use it once every 3 weeks (or more frequently if I&#x27;ve been using a lot of heat and styling products) and during the winter about every 9 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried many many other conditioners, none of them was comparable.</li>
            <li>As an extra bonus, this stuff actually smells good!</li>
            <li>NOTHING SPECIAL, MAGICAL OR DIFFERENT</li>
            <li>It glides right through my hair like butter.</li>
            <li>Now, some could say, it wasn&#x27;t this, but I know it happened right after I washed it out.  </li>
            <li>When I have lots of new growth, it melts the tangles away making detangling sooooo incredibly easy for me.  </li>
            <li>Just after one use I can feel and see a major differance in my hair :)</li>
            <li>The chlorine really dries out my hair even though I have used special shampoo for swimmer.</li>
            <li>The smell is candy-like but light and doesn&#x27;t linger; the texture of the conditioner is like cream, and the result was super easy to comb hair that dried nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Easy, light, hair is immediately softer, and moister, will definitely recommend to family or friend.</li>
            <li>Not expensive at all and worth every penny</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that Neutrogena made hair care, as well as skin care, products, but we have one right here.  </li>
            <li>my hair feels soft afer using the hair mask and easy to get the tangles out, however, beyond that i dont see any advantage.</li>
            <li>My last treatment cream made my hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Also makes my hair soft and easy to pull a brush through.  </li>
            <li>After it is rinsed out, the hair is so soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it because she uses pretty much the whole jar on her hair, but it&#x27;s worth it-keeps it soft</li>
            <li>love it wish they had larger ones this finish too quickly for me within two weeks am i using too much.  </li>
            <li>I used this today for the first time and my hair is so soft (when it is normally a bit dry after I give it a good shampoo and conditioning) and light</li>
            <li>Not sure if they may have changed the formula or maybe I&#x27;ve just tried a lot of really amazing hair masks now!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s one of the higher rated masks in all the research that I did.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and tangle free after using this product.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t moisturize my ends very well!</li>
            <li>I just used it on my hair for the first time ever and its still have it in my hair</li>
            <li>i used the whole jar in one use!</li>
            <li>Even for the price, it didn&#x27;t do much more for my hair than a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner really brought my hair back to life and did I mention how great this product smells too?</li>
            <li>I have Frederick Fekkai Technician Shampoo and Conditioner and like this much better, with this I actually see a difference.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to gamble away my money on products that could do more bad than good.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and leaves my hair incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Very like the product!</li>
            <li>I love this deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>Only then I rinse it off at the basin :)</li>
            <li>This product seems more like a &amp;#34;good conditioner&amp;#34; rather than deep recovery.</li>
            <li>Love this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>i got back on Amazon and order 3 more jars for my daughters.</li>
            <li>thin hair is incredibly prone to become static and on some days I look electrocuted by mid afternoon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After first using it (10 min in hair),  the tangles were out of my hair with a lustrous feel to it.</li>
            <li>and it works and does exactly what it says it will do...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll probably keep looking for something with a greater value that will last longer.</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love this product -- but give it time and use it regularly -- you&#x27;ll see results ovre 4-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>i will definitely order more when i run out.</li>
            <li>I used this and the Loreal stuff a few days apart as I wanted to get a good feel for each.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many products, including very expensive ones, but this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>It was smaller than expected but over all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>So even after first use you actually can see result, my hair getting more shiny and soft !</li>
            <li>My hair never been so soft, I have quite damaged hair, but after few weeks just amazing!</li>
            <li>I put it on while my hair is dry and leave in for about an hour or two (sometimes longer, the longer the better for me).</li>
            <li>Super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>so it lasts a long time, smells good, and u can notice instantly a difference in the health of your hair!</li>
            <li>In an effort to stop spending money on high end products, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in the regular stores looking for great products.</li>
            <li>After all this coloring on my hair, and using flat irons and curling irons to make it appear smooth, while just adding more damage, my hair really just felt like straw, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li>Frizz is an issue with me as is just getting a large tooth comb through it even with conditioner on it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at a stage where I am still trying to find what works best for my dry, thick hair.</li>
            <li>I used this for years off and on and it seemed to work fine on my hair back then.</li>
            <li>and i used about a Tablespoon-full of it, so not a tiny bit as others indicate for their fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that recently became overprocessed.</li>
            <li>I think it most be for very dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Some deep conditioners are so light that you practically need a whole handful for one treatment but a large coin sized amount of this will do the trick.  </li>
            <li>i can tell a huge difference from the last product i used even from a salon.</li>
            <li>and you get such great results without any heavy hair.</li>
            <li>so I had no idea how much to use.</li>
            <li>so i wanted to look for a much cheaper alternative</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft,shiny, and deep-moisturized.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>So I only use it before important events.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I havent really used this as much</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use it in the shower for just a fast conditioner as opposed to leaving it on and even then there&#x27;s a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>this was really unusual.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll get it again, maybe since there isn&#x27;t much out there</li>
            <li>I find that I have to use a whole lot of it to sufficiently coat my hair.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer unless I absolutely have too).</li>
            <li>My daughter was amazed on how much it helped my hair so she started to use it and loves it too!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Rusk Deepshine Luster.</li>
            <li>I use this to condition my hair after every shampoo and it conditions and detangles really well without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>However, this deep conditioner, I sleep with in a wrap over night and rinse out in the morning with a light shampoo</li>
            <li>I am going to be very tempted to use it every time if needed.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time in the pool and my hair really pays for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>and u dont need much</li>
            <li>I like it because it leaves your hair so smooth, and it actually re-hydrates hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone with hair like mine!</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t explain what it does you have to see for yourself</li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer than before.</li>
            <li>However, it has been a real treat trying all the products.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel any different  than if I used a really cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have never had a real case of breakage or split ends</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s got to be something in this product that softens too much.  </li>
            <li>I hope this helps people who really need their hair replenished.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>, I finally decided to do my own at home deep conditioning at the advice of my stylist.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is relatively inexpensive and leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This is good thick conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have a cabinet full of conditioners that promised soft curls, more moisture and less frizz that did not work.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a new deep conditioner and Triple Moisture is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dry anymore, but soft and easy to brush now.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, fine, colored, with damaged ends that I do trim every 4/5 weeks.</li>
            <li>scent, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything in particular.  </li>
            <li>I have really dry hair that often gets tangled and breaks off easily.</li>
            <li>I just applied more of the mask to the dry hair and viola, soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked just as well as the keratin smoothing treatment for the damage and flyaways.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was using macadamia natural oil hair mask which does wonders for my hair but is pretty pricy</li>
            <li>It may be too much conditioning for people with normal hair but mine</li>
            <li>This is the first I&#x27;ve used clarifying shampoo since going natural over a year ago</li>
            <li>I did decide to give my hair a final cool water rinse to close the cuticle and that may have helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really prefer all natural products, but this really has saved/softened my hair on occasion when it really needs help.</li>
            <li>The cuticule is sealed down and my hair looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>200% better than I expected!!</li>
            <li>I am using comparatively the same amount of product for each, so effectively, I am spending four times more for this 6-oz product, which performs no better than Garnier&#x27;s 24-oz Sleek and Shine Conditioner at Amazon&#x27;s current pricings.  </li>
            <li>I had better luck with the suave Moroccan oil products which is half the price.</li>
            <li>I went back to the  mirror and used a soft padded brush to try to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s comparable to many of the regular daily conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Instead of buying this, get a regular conditioner and use more than necessary.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>Luckily the bottle is double reinforced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several hair care products from the most expensive to the cheapest ones, but have  never been happy enough with a product to stick with it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try this product for yourself.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, thick hair and with just the right amount, my hair looks shiny and healthy and it is also soft.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews , i was quite excited hoping this product would fix my dry n brittle hair.</li>
            <li>Works really well on my natural Afro textured hair.</li>
            <li>This one really delivers and my hair feels non frizzy, soft and like hair should.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>It really made my hair soft</li>
            <li>I suffer from hair loss if I use normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>Worth the price if you bought it at the local drug store and didn&#x27;t have to pay the shipping.</li>
            <li>My hair is now super soft and it actually helps with the frizz.</li>
            <li>I have highly color treated hair and have tried so many conditioning products in the past.  </li>
            <li>It was like I had a new head of hair.</li>
            <li>so you got to get a new one about every month.  </li>
            <li>This was a new product for me.  </li>
            <li>and I have fine hair, but it never weighed it down.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be a miraculous difference due to the fact that I couldn&#x27;t possibly damage my hair any more than it is.</li>
            <li>was hoping that this product would smooth the frizz enough to where I would not have to use flat irons or heat to take away the frizz</li>
            <li>It left my hair refreshed when I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Once a week and my hair with use of the Triple Moisture Shampoo and Conditoner is always soft and shiny as can be!</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night</li>
            <li>However, once my hair is dry I have noticed it has more split ends and seems very &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; in spots, although I haven&#x27;t colored my hair recently, and barely ever use heat products.&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product, my hair never felt so dry at the ends and certain</li>
            <li>this product adds something to make your hair feel soft at first, but slowly actually dries it out.  </li>
            <li>Even smaller hairs that seem new were just sticking straight up</li>
            <li>/&gt;This might be too conditioning for people with fine, oily or limp hair textures though.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair, greasy on the roots but dry at  the ends.</li>
            <li>and it really makes my hair feel soft, especially after all the straightening and blow drying</li>
            <li>I color my hair every 5-6 months and Neutrogena mask keeps my hair shiny, soft and naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>It felt so soft and silky gliding through my hair</li>
            <li>My hair was naturally curly as a young child.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I have natural 3c/4a hair with protein overload.</li>
            <li>I just started using this and after one application my hair is soft.</li>
            <li>Made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on Wednesday of this week (today is Friday) after reading reviews that said it worked, fixed damaged hair, etc.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my hair especially now that its winter.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>After applying the mask and a conditioning bag for about five minutes in the shower, I could then run my fingers through it and it felt buttery soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair ends up soft, shiny, and detangled.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Mine hair is heat and chemically damages, but this product really made a difference after using it only twice.</li>
            <li>So if you are sensitive at all, please heed my advice and maybe not risk it.</li>
            <li>Made it feel perfectly soft.</li>
            <li>I am not affiliated with Garnier...just sharing my direct and practical experience with others</li>
            <li>with several bleach and dye jobs trying to maintain a golden blonde.</li>
            <li>and my hair is returning to its natural state despite my limited use of hot styling tools.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair nice but not nearly as good as some salon brands leave it.</li>
            <li>I know it may be a little difficult to see on the video, but this product really works great.</li>
            <li>and I usually use sulfate free shampoo or co-wash with conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I went to a place and they damaged my hair to the point where even experts couldn&#x27;t even get it back to normal.</li>
            <li>I also have severely dry hair and using this 3 days a week has helped to make my hair a bit softer and MUCH easier to brush out.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very stringy and dry.</li>
            <li>I bought this Neutrogena Hair Mask and the Daily Deep Conditioner--this did absolutely nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and often found that deep conditioners left my hair feeling greasy and weighed down for a couple of days after use.  </li>
            <li>She loves the product as it left her hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Will be going back my now holy grail mask macadamia natural oil mask where you can purchase for cheaper at target!</li>
            <li>AND IT NEEDED SOME MAJOR TLC</li>
            <li>Normally, the day after I use this mask, my hair would be very moisturized and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and leaves my thick 4a/b natural hair feeling super soft, silky, moisturized.</li>
            <li>My ends are looking to much better, my hair is breaking less, and I am getting far less if any spit ends!</li>
            <li>It was very very soft but so soft it broke since it was dry.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I generally like Neutrogena products</li>
            <li>The container it comes in means you take a huge risk of getting all the contents wet when opening in the bath or shower especially since you need to dig in with a wet hand.</li>
            <li>After I left the salon with the Redken treatment I did feel that my hair was exceptionally soft, but that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to feel after a color and cut.</li>
            <li>Not even leave in smoothers work on my hair to give it that soft Asian like hair feeling.</li>
            <li>Since I finally found Triple Moisture,  which I use once a week,  my hair recovered shine, bounce,  and looks alive again.  </li>
            <li>and i have no regrets.</li>
            <li>It did not leave my hair as soft as I like and did not give my hair nearly enough moisture.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>The consistency was like a thin cream conditioner but it felt more like an over watered-down product on my hair.</li>
            <li>It was OK but not nearly as great as the comments said.</li>
            <li>Hundreds of little strands were bent out of my hair just sticking right out in triangular angles all over my head.</li>
            <li>I might be exaggerating a little, but if felt like I put it in and after keeping it in for a couple of hours it just came right out.</li>
            <li>I had this little jar sitting in my drawn for quite some time now and used it for the first time three days ago.</li>
            <li>I am not seeing a major difference in my hair, but enough that I continue to use the product.</li>
            <li>I expected a lot from this product since it was so highly rated.</li>
            <li>I got this not long ago and have been using it once a week as instructed-</li>
            <li>My 11 year old has long curly hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavy for everyday use with my hair type, but I use it several times a week and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few that really works well on my hair!</li>
            <li>iF your hair is really dry or brittle and you put a softening agent like this one on it, it will make it soft</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product a few weeks (one or two times a week) and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate, so humidity isn&#x27;t a problem, but my hair always feels dry.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> : After using tens and tens of hair conditioners and masks - all price ranges, I can say this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product.</li>
            <li> So it has been my best choice ever since I found out this solution.</li>
            <li> I googled \\&quot;best drugstore</li>
            <li> For best results, stick to using it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> So happy I bought it!</li>
            <li> The hair mask along with the heat from the curling iron locked in the moisture and smoothed the hair shafts out wonderfully.</li>

            <li> This hair mask is amazing!!!!</li>

            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> I figured after the wonderful reviews this product received it would be a winner.</li>

            <li> Very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> Plus it smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t have very good reviews to go by.</li>
            <li> My hair was noticeably shiny, softer and the slip was incredible.</li>
            <li> it is so good!</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients aren&#x27;t the best, but for the price I think this product is good.</li>
            <li> best product i&#x27;ve ever used; not greasy at all; and really a cheap price!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product based on the great reviews it had.</li>
            <li> I did use this product on my nieces hair and worked great - she doesn&#x27;t have chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> I will give Neutrogena credit - the hair mask smells great and does work on virgin hair.</li>
            <li> but I hope it works just great for me.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> It does a great job for me.</li>
            <li> The difference is that great.</li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews and tried this one.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> which is great given the toll the humidity has been taking on my hair.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is great though.</li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> Feels great</li>
            <li> I went on Amazon, looked at all the great reviews for this..</li>
            <li> Great stuff</li>
            <li> smells great, helps with breakage and split ends</li>
            <li> It also smells really great.</li>

            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Best of all, it is way cheaper than most brands.</li>
            <li> I promise! :o)</li>
            <li> Love this product, best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had for my hair.</li>
            <li> this is the best conditioning treatment! :)</li>
            <li> Its perfect in so many ways....</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works very effectively and smells great!</li>
            <li> The smell isnt as pleasant but it works well on my hair.</li>
            <li> : it has a pleasant scent; yet it doesn&#x27;t seem to activate any allergies,</li>
            <li> Not the most moisturizing conditioner I have ever used, but for the price it is very good.</li>
            <li> I have never found a product that worked really good at smoothing my hair out.</li>
            <li> cant be that good?</li>
            <li> I read mainly good reviews about it, so I decided to run over to Target and pick it up.</li>
            <li> It can be used weekly with good results.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and it leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I just put a good amount on the ends of my hair (never the stop or it will make your scalp greasy)</li>
            <li> I just received the Mask it smells good.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good conditioner for a lot of people but not for my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and it worked so good</li>
            <li> Some products were good, but nothing as good as this one.</li>
            <li> It was good</li>
            <li> I hope others have as good of luck as I did.</li>
            <li> I take good care of my hair, and I will never put anything Neutrogena on my hair again.  </li>
            <li> Very good product, hair get silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the Loreal overnight hair treatment after reading so many great reviews here.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much!!!!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Thats why I love this hair mask!</li>
            <li> I have been able to successfully grow my hair now without having to chop it off because the ends are so damaged.</li>
            <li> I overprocessed with a relaxer and then added a semi permanent color on top!  </li>
            <li> in a couple weeks I switched too the recommended once a week treatment and my hair looked and felt so much better!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year and love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine color treated hair and this is great</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> and it just works amazing.</li>

            <li> The results are amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product</li>
            <li> smells amazing.</li>
            <li> but it does my hair good :)</li>
            <li> Neutrogena makes great products at reasonable prices, there&#x27;s no need to spend a lot of money for a great conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used and great price.</li>
            <li> Just the kind of slip i like.</li>
            <li> Really does work,,, impressed.</li>
            <li> and my hair feels like it has just had a good haircut - bouncy, healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> In addition, this hair mask is a great alternative to the Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque which is also excellent, but pricey.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best ones I have used, It really works</li>
            <li> I chose this one by the reviews and it really works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this product but my hair didn&#x27;t take to well to it.</li>
            <li> Some are pretty awesome and work just as well as the salon brands, and some drug store brands work even better.</li>
            <li> This must work for many, there are so many good reviews</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super concentrated which is great.  </li>
            <li> i have super curly hair and this help manage it and smells great.</li>
            <li> I have curl hair and it was very easy to untangle after this product.</li>
            <li> hoping to see more progress as I use the product more!</li>
            <li> These are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used !!!</li>
            <li> I  was looking for a good and cheap moisturizing treatment.</li>
            <li> I love the cream and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and perfect</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this, but I do recommend garnier frutis hair mask which smells delicious and makes my hair feel great and cost half the price of this watery stuff.</li>
            <li> Great for right after a bleach job, too.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and am attempting to grow it out.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> good scent and good body, its not sticky and very affordable..</li>
            <li> The conditioning mask is great, but the 6 oz goes fast!  </li>
            <li> oh, and the amount is very huge~</li>
            <li> It felt very smooth washing off</li>
            <li> make hair very smooth and all my friends like this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging is handy, easy to grasp and work with.  </li>
            <li> HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> One for the top of my hair and one for the bottom.</li>
            <li> and it works better than what it said on the jar.</li>
            <li> I hope Neutogena won&#x27;t be skipping on the ingredients too :)</li>
            <li> Eh - its ok.  </li>
            <li> IT SEEMS TO BE OK.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s more like an emergency hair repair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> You have to use it maximum twice a week, any more</li>
            <li> I must say I love it.</li>
            <li> Just order 2 more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would definitely consider this a awesome drugstore find and would repurchase this over.</li>
            <li> I hope that I continue to feel satisfied</li>
            <li> And for the price, you can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> So, saves a ton of money and you get better hair than ever.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Love to keep this mask over night.</li>
            <li> :) I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> so I am dying my hair more than I ever have before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I cover my hair with a shower cap to allow my body heat to help the conditioner penetrate my hair strands better.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I like this product.</li>
            <li> but i found something better.</li>
            <li> I am coloring my hair many years</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about Nutrogena Triple Moisture at the web and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to all who likes healthy hair, regardless of your race.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was buying an asian leave in conditioner that was awesome.</li>
            <li> It is OK, will not buy again.</li>
            <li> 10/10 would do again best deep hair mask that i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> i think it is some thing that many people can</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> favorite part is the winter static</li>
            <li> so glad thats under control now because of this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as a deep conditioner and am so impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed color treated hair, I have used many deep conditioners and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> I started my healthy hair journey in March of 2011 and began using it then.  </li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> it actually replaced the pantene provene curly series i used to buy... and the best thing is that you dont need to saturate your hair with this stuff to get results</li>
            <li> i am satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li> As each month passes and my damaged hair is increasingly cut off, my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioner</li>
            <li> and I wish it would have worked better for me.  </li>
            <li> My husband noticed it and said, you better check out your hair.  </li>
            <li> Glad it worked for some people.  </li>
            <li> Replaced my regular conditioner with this and after one week my hair is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Great deal, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Im just going to put it out there, and say that this is the best hair mask Ive used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> This Neutrogena is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my local CVS for $8 and its ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that most reviews are from those with fine hair</li>
            <li> excellent for very dry hair.</li>
            <li> Back then, grocery/drug store brands weren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and worth every penny of the $6 I paid at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, manageable and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> It smell great and provided nice slip on my chemical free kinky African America hair.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair smelling great, feeling soft, and extremely easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Miracle didn&#x27;t happen, but it leaves my hair easy to comb.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use</li>
            <li> I have tested leaving in with another product (Garnier Fructis, Sleek and Shine Conditioner) and had better results, measured by how easily it is to run a comb to smooth the conditioner over my tangled hair and how smooth it is after blow-drying.  </li>
            <li> That was so much cheaper and more effective.     </li>
            <li> My hair stays hydrated and strong and doesn&#x27;t get brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hi all, it has strong fragrance smell.</li>
            <li> Its good, and leaves hair soft, but Morrocan Oil for me is much better.</li>
            <li> It will transform your dry damaged hair into beautiful healthy hair.</li>
            <li> like they were full of static.</li>
            <li> I am 31 yo and my hair has always been fine, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> I pay triple for other top brand masks and this one is just as good!</li>
            <li> Because my hair is fine</li>
            <li> I have fine, overly processed hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s super light!</li>
            <li> Came so quick! &amp; worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> I like to try different hair treatment product, and it is my first time to try Neutrogena&#x27;s hair product, and it is a good experience, good product</li>
            <li> I have used this product for dry fly away hair and repair of color treated hair for many years..</li>
            <li> Amazing, completely fixed my hair after being processed and bleached so many times and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get it to help.</li>
            <li> and I already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> After I shower, I would take a dime sized, smooth it on my hair, and comb to even it out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s light and silky and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> My hair went from looking frizzy, to silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> After shampooing i smooth this all threw out my hair and put a plastic cap on then let it sit for 10 15 minutes  after you wash it out</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I can keep it in my shower and it is readily available.</li>
            <li> how fortunate I was to have found another product that works well and saves me on costs.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because it was so affordable for a deep conditioner and still had great reviews.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this really inexpensive deep hair mask is the best one.  </li>
            <li> I believe that I can find an equally good deep conditioner with much more.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find it still available as have not found it in stores for a few years...</li>
            <li> Then I used a blow dryer on warm high setting.</li>
            <li> It made my hair super soft and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> My hair just felt more softer, healthier, and it actually looked more voluminous!</li>
            <li> but it is worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> They might make your hair look fabulous but you absolutely can&#x27;t let anyone touch your beautiful tresses because they feel totally disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will weigh your hair down if you use too much, but if you get the amount correct-it is the perfect mask at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> But there is nothing special or &amp;#34;extra moisturizing&amp;#34; about this stuff at all.</li>
            <li> I found and used this mask and noticed a huge difference the first time I used it!  </li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever left on Amazon about any product, but I decided I HAD to share with my fellow frizz-heads about why this product is so great.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and smells amazing, I do recommend to EVERYONE</li>
            <li> I  have very corase hair that I consider to be type 4b, so I use a lot more that a dime size</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good hair mask.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have always loved this.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and this product feels best on my hair</li>
            <li> but I wear it straight most days, so</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good deep moisturizer and found all the reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> It makes my life full of good-hair day.</li>
            <li> Not a bad choice for when you don&#x27;t want to pay for a salon quality product.</li>
            <li> I have searched long and hard for a good hair mask, and this is definitely an excellent one.</li>
            <li> It works fine at first.  </li>
            <li> Boy I got lucky.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this as a weekly deep conditioner until I find the next best thing that works for my hair.</li>
            <li> The big surprise is I&#x27;ve got the best shine back in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is super</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair incredibly soft and smooth, removes tangles and knots instantly, and smells great.</li>
            <li> I put this in my coarse like hair from dying my hair so much and it revived my hair back to silky and smooth feeling :D</li>
            <li> Honestly, you will get more than your money&#x27;s worth from this jar of hair mask than any other salon brand on the market.</li>
            <li> It leaves it super soft and super healthy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (to fragrances mostly) and this doesn&#x27;t break me out at all.  </li>
            <li> I thought okay and was very surprised.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is and moisterizes your hair ridicousely!</li>
            <li> The FIRST time I used it my hair came out the softest I have ever felt it!</li>
            <li> I had tried all kinds of rememdies to fix it to include throwing avacado and mayo on my hair (which turned into a funny profile pic on fb!).</li>
            <li> I like it well enough to use the rest of it, but will be searching for something better for my hair!</li>
            <li> is dry, coarse &amp; frizzy and this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve found for my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair super soft when i deep condition overnight.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair (but I have a lot of it)</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review with the fact that I have fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T REALLY NOTICE A HUGE DIFFERENCE..</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I left it in for 30 mins and my hair felt amazing.</li>
            <li> I have thick 4AB  hair and this stuff is amazing amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and for only 7 dollars it is a steal.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Neutrogena triple moisture for anybody who is looking for a effective inexpensive deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I tried so many but this one left my hair feeling like silk for so so cheap.</li>
            <li> The product is simple to use, does not require the ultimately damaging utilization of a blow dryer, and gives good results: my hair feels as nurtured as when I have used beauty salon products that cost much more.  </li>
            <li> I will never use another kind of Deep Conditoner!</li>
            <li> the return on your investment is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> If I had not paid $7 and instead bought it from the $1 store then I would say it was worth the dollar.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> but bottom line, it leaves my hair feeling healthy and really soft...</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, and healthy, and the effect lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> During the summer I use it once every 3 weeks (or more frequently if I&#x27;ve been using a lot of heat and styling products) and during the winter about every 9 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried many many other conditioners, none of them was comparable.</li>
            <li> As an extra bonus, this stuff actually smells good!</li>
            <li> NOTHING SPECIAL, MAGICAL OR DIFFERENT</li>
            <li> It glides right through my hair like butter.</li>
            <li> Now, some could say, it wasn&#x27;t this, but I know it happened right after I washed it out.  </li>
            <li> When I have lots of new growth, it melts the tangles away making detangling sooooo incredibly easy for me.  </li>
            <li> Just after one use I can feel and see a major differance in my hair :)</li>
            <li> The chlorine really dries out my hair even though I have used special shampoo for swimmer.</li>
            <li> The smell is candy-like but light and doesn&#x27;t linger; the texture of the conditioner is like cream, and the result was super easy to comb hair that dried nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Easy, light, hair is immediately softer, and moister, will definitely recommend to family or friend.</li>
            <li> Not expensive at all and worth every penny</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that Neutrogena made hair care, as well as skin care, products, but we have one right here.  </li>
            <li> my hair feels soft afer using the hair mask and easy to get the tangles out, however, beyond that i dont see any advantage.</li>
            <li> My last treatment cream made my hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Also makes my hair soft and easy to pull a brush through.  </li>
            <li> After it is rinsed out, the hair is so soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find it because she uses pretty much the whole jar on her hair, but it&#x27;s worth it-keeps it soft</li>
            <li> love it wish they had larger ones this finish too quickly for me within two weeks am i using too much.  </li>
            <li> I used this today for the first time and my hair is so soft (when it is normally a bit dry after I give it a good shampoo and conditioning) and light</li>
            <li> Not sure if they may have changed the formula or maybe I&#x27;ve just tried a lot of really amazing hair masks now!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s one of the higher rated masks in all the research that I did.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and tangle free after using this product.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t moisturize my ends very well!</li>
            <li> I just used it on my hair for the first time ever and its still have it in my hair</li>
            <li> i used the whole jar in one use!</li>
            <li> Even for the price, it didn&#x27;t do much more for my hair than a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner really brought my hair back to life and did I mention how great this product smells too?</li>
            <li> I have Frederick Fekkai Technician Shampoo and Conditioner and like this much better, with this I actually see a difference.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to gamble away my money on products that could do more bad than good.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and leaves my hair incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Very like the product!</li>
            <li> I love this deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> Only then I rinse it off at the basin :)</li>
            <li> This product seems more like a &amp;#34;good conditioner&amp;#34; rather than deep recovery.</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> i got back on Amazon and order 3 more jars for my daughters.</li>
            <li> thin hair is incredibly prone to become static and on some days I look electrocuted by mid afternoon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After first using it (10 min in hair),  the tangles were out of my hair with a lustrous feel to it.</li>
            <li> and it works and does exactly what it says it will do...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll probably keep looking for something with a greater value that will last longer.</li>
            <li> Try it, you&#x27;ll love this product -- but give it time and use it regularly -- you&#x27;ll see results ovre 4-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> i will definitely order more when i run out.</li>
            <li> I used this and the Loreal stuff a few days apart as I wanted to get a good feel for each.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many products, including very expensive ones, but this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> It was smaller than expected but over all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So even after first use you actually can see result, my hair getting more shiny and soft !</li>
            <li> My hair never been so soft, I have quite damaged hair, but after few weeks just amazing!</li>
            <li> I put it on while my hair is dry and leave in for about an hour or two (sometimes longer, the longer the better for me).</li>
            <li> Super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time, smells good, and u can notice instantly a difference in the health of your hair!</li>
            <li> In an effort to stop spending money on high end products, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in the regular stores looking for great products.</li>
            <li> After all this coloring on my hair, and using flat irons and curling irons to make it appear smooth, while just adding more damage, my hair really just felt like straw, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li> Frizz is an issue with me as is just getting a large tooth comb through it even with conditioner on it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at a stage where I am still trying to find what works best for my dry, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I used this for years off and on and it seemed to work fine on my hair back then.</li>
            <li> and i used about a Tablespoon-full of it, so not a tiny bit as others indicate for their fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that recently became overprocessed.</li>
            <li> I think it most be for very dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Some deep conditioners are so light that you practically need a whole handful for one treatment but a large coin sized amount of this will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> i can tell a huge difference from the last product i used even from a salon.</li>
            <li> and you get such great results without any heavy hair.</li>
            <li> so I had no idea how much to use.</li>
            <li> so i wanted to look for a much cheaper alternative</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft,shiny, and deep-moisturized.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> So I only use it before important events.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I havent really used this as much</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it in the shower for just a fast conditioner as opposed to leaving it on and even then there&#x27;s a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> this was really unusual.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll get it again, maybe since there isn&#x27;t much out there</li>
            <li> I find that I have to use a whole lot of it to sufficiently coat my hair.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer unless I absolutely have too).</li>
            <li> My daughter was amazed on how much it helped my hair so she started to use it and loves it too!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Rusk Deepshine Luster.</li>
            <li> I use this to condition my hair after every shampoo and it conditions and detangles really well without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> However, this deep conditioner, I sleep with in a wrap over night and rinse out in the morning with a light shampoo</li>
            <li> I am going to be very tempted to use it every time if needed.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time in the pool and my hair really pays for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> and u dont need much</li>
            <li> I like it because it leaves your hair so smooth, and it actually re-hydrates hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone with hair like mine!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t explain what it does you have to see for yourself</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer than before.</li>
            <li> However, it has been a real treat trying all the products.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel any different  than if I used a really cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have never had a real case of breakage or split ends</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s got to be something in this product that softens too much.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps people who really need their hair replenished.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> , I finally decided to do my own at home deep conditioning at the advice of my stylist.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is relatively inexpensive and leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is good thick conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have a cabinet full of conditioners that promised soft curls, more moisture and less frizz that did not work.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a new deep conditioner and Triple Moisture is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dry anymore, but soft and easy to brush now.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, fine, colored, with damaged ends that I do trim every 4/5 weeks.</li>
            <li> scent, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything in particular.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry hair that often gets tangled and breaks off easily.</li>
            <li> I just applied more of the mask to the dry hair and viola, soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked just as well as the keratin smoothing treatment for the damage and flyaways.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using macadamia natural oil hair mask which does wonders for my hair but is pretty pricy</li>
            <li> It may be too much conditioning for people with normal hair but mine</li>
            <li> This is the first I&#x27;ve used clarifying shampoo since going natural over a year ago</li>
            <li> I did decide to give my hair a final cool water rinse to close the cuticle and that may have helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really prefer all natural products, but this really has saved/softened my hair on occasion when it really needs help.</li>
            <li> The cuticule is sealed down and my hair looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> 200% better than I expected!!</li>
            <li> I am using comparatively the same amount of product for each, so effectively, I am spending four times more for this 6-oz product, which performs no better than Garnier&#x27;s 24-oz Sleek and Shine Conditioner at Amazon&#x27;s current pricings.  </li>
            <li> I had better luck with the suave Moroccan oil products which is half the price.</li>
            <li> I went back to the  mirror and used a soft padded brush to try to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s comparable to many of the regular daily conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying this, get a regular conditioner and use more than necessary.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Luckily the bottle is double reinforced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several hair care products from the most expensive to the cheapest ones, but have  never been happy enough with a product to stick with it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try this product for yourself.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, thick hair and with just the right amount, my hair looks shiny and healthy and it is also soft.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews , i was quite excited hoping this product would fix my dry n brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my natural Afro textured hair.</li>
            <li> This one really delivers and my hair feels non frizzy, soft and like hair should.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> It really made my hair soft</li>
            <li> I suffer from hair loss if I use normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> Worth the price if you bought it at the local drug store and didn&#x27;t have to pay the shipping.</li>
            <li> My hair is now super soft and it actually helps with the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have highly color treated hair and have tried so many conditioning products in the past.  </li>
            <li> It was like I had a new head of hair.</li>
            <li> so you got to get a new one about every month.  </li>
            <li> This was a new product for me.  </li>
            <li> and I have fine hair, but it never weighed it down.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a miraculous difference due to the fact that I couldn&#x27;t possibly damage my hair any more than it is.</li>
            <li> was hoping that this product would smooth the frizz enough to where I would not have to use flat irons or heat to take away the frizz</li>
            <li> It left my hair refreshed when I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Once a week and my hair with use of the Triple Moisture Shampoo and Conditoner is always soft and shiny as can be!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night</li>
            <li> However, once my hair is dry I have noticed it has more split ends and seems very &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; in spots, although I haven&#x27;t colored my hair recently, and barely ever use heat products.&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product, my hair never felt so dry at the ends and certain</li>
            <li> this product adds something to make your hair feel soft at first, but slowly actually dries it out.  </li>
            <li> Even smaller hairs that seem new were just sticking straight up</li>
            <li> /&gt;This might be too conditioning for people with fine, oily or limp hair textures though.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, greasy on the roots but dry at  the ends.</li>
            <li> and it really makes my hair feel soft, especially after all the straightening and blow drying</li>
            <li> I color my hair every 5-6 months and Neutrogena mask keeps my hair shiny, soft and naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> It felt so soft and silky gliding through my hair</li>
            <li> My hair was naturally curly as a young child.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c/4a hair with protein overload.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and after one application my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> Made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Wednesday of this week (today is Friday) after reading reviews that said it worked, fixed damaged hair, etc.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my hair especially now that its winter.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> After applying the mask and a conditioning bag for about five minutes in the shower, I could then run my fingers through it and it felt buttery soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair ends up soft, shiny, and detangled.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Mine hair is heat and chemically damages, but this product really made a difference after using it only twice.</li>
            <li> So if you are sensitive at all, please heed my advice and maybe not risk it.</li>
            <li> Made it feel perfectly soft.</li>
            <li> I am not affiliated with Garnier...just sharing my direct and practical experience with others</li>
            <li> with several bleach and dye jobs trying to maintain a golden blonde.</li>
            <li> and my hair is returning to its natural state despite my limited use of hot styling tools.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair nice but not nearly as good as some salon brands leave it.</li>
            <li> I know it may be a little difficult to see on the video, but this product really works great.</li>
            <li> and I usually use sulfate free shampoo or co-wash with conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I went to a place and they damaged my hair to the point where even experts couldn&#x27;t even get it back to normal.</li>
            <li> I also have severely dry hair and using this 3 days a week has helped to make my hair a bit softer and MUCH easier to brush out.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very stringy and dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this Neutrogena Hair Mask and the Daily Deep Conditioner--this did absolutely nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and often found that deep conditioners left my hair feeling greasy and weighed down for a couple of days after use.  </li>
            <li> She loves the product as it left her hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Will be going back my now holy grail mask macadamia natural oil mask where you can purchase for cheaper at target!</li>
            <li> AND IT NEEDED SOME MAJOR TLC</li>
            <li> Normally, the day after I use this mask, my hair would be very moisturized and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and leaves my thick 4a/b natural hair feeling super soft, silky, moisturized.</li>
            <li> My ends are looking to much better, my hair is breaking less, and I am getting far less if any spit ends!</li>
            <li> It was very very soft but so soft it broke since it was dry.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I generally like Neutrogena products</li>
            <li> The container it comes in means you take a huge risk of getting all the contents wet when opening in the bath or shower especially since you need to dig in with a wet hand.</li>
            <li> After I left the salon with the Redken treatment I did feel that my hair was exceptionally soft, but that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to feel after a color and cut.</li>
            <li> Not even leave in smoothers work on my hair to give it that soft Asian like hair feeling.</li>
            <li> Since I finally found Triple Moisture,  which I use once a week,  my hair recovered shine, bounce,  and looks alive again.  </li>
            <li> and i have no regrets.</li>
            <li> It did not leave my hair as soft as I like and did not give my hair nearly enough moisture.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> The consistency was like a thin cream conditioner but it felt more like an over watered-down product on my hair.</li>
            <li> It was OK but not nearly as great as the comments said.</li>
            <li> Hundreds of little strands were bent out of my hair just sticking right out in triangular angles all over my head.</li>
            <li> I might be exaggerating a little, but if felt like I put it in and after keeping it in for a couple of hours it just came right out.</li>
            <li> I had this little jar sitting in my drawn for quite some time now and used it for the first time three days ago.</li>
            <li> I am not seeing a major difference in my hair, but enough that I continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot from this product since it was so highly rated.</li>
            <li> I got this not long ago and have been using it once a week as instructed-</li>
            <li> My 11 year old has long curly hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy for everyday use with my hair type, but I use it several times a week and love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few that really works well on my hair!</li>
            <li> iF your hair is really dry or brittle and you put a softening agent like this one on it, it will make it soft</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product a few weeks (one or two times a week) and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate, so humidity isn&#x27;t a problem, but my hair always feels dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and frizzy and I have tried many shampoos and conditioners over the years to try and tame it, but none of them ever worked, until I purchased Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask.</li>
            <li> The other one is worth the money, especially because you only need a little but and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally medium brown with reddish highlights and in the course of 3 years, I have played around with color going to dark red, bleach blond, ash blond, and now ash brown with highlights.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I wake up everyday with my hair so smooth and silky, and no more frizziness.</li>
            <li> It was not a bad product, but not great either... I would use this product on a daily basis if it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> This product is very inexpensive from the other deep conditioners ive used (Alterna and Redken) and it doesnt leave my hair weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair a few weeks ago, so it already started out extremely dry, but it didn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li> I use a deep conditioner as my daily conditioner because of my extremely dry and chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly African American hair that can get dry  (somewhere between 3b and 3c).</li>
            <li> This past treatment, my hair started to really break off.</li>
            <li> My hair is also long, almost reaching my lower back.</li>
            <li> Between the dye, the blow dryer, the flat iron and my time on the beach</li>
            <li> I used a flat iron on it and damaged it...</li>
            <li> and I could tell that my hair had improved through one use when I flat ironed it.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money did nothing on my hair just like a normal conditioner I didn&#x27;t like the product</li>
            <li> She used it on her damaged hair a few times (from dyes) before her hair became normal again.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of using different brands of \\&quot;repair shampoos\\&quot; and \\&quot;intense conditioners\\&quot; with little to no success I found this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair was so dry I could barely brush it afterward and after two days of not shampooing it, it still looked just as dry!</li>
            <li> I have  coarse, dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Having relaxed hair my hair is really dry and regular conditioner just does&#x27;nt cut it for my hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely gone within a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> I leave it in for up to half hour, then wash out with shampoo, and my hair is SO soft.</li>
            <li> That said, it is reasonable to expect that this thick conditioner, for its price, would out-perform regular conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have thick long Asian hair, but this did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I find that most deep conditioners that say &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; on them tend to be really hard for me to rinse out and leave a film behind but this only took maybe 2 minutes for me to rinse and there was no film.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest the same results for other hair and/or hair types, only mine.  </li>
            <li> Coarse hair, with a very dry scalp...</li>
            <li> I have blonde highlights that became very dry with lots of breakage, this conditioner after using it twice in 5 days</li>
            <li> The scent was really light and faint and floral.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> I always feel like when I open this container it is soaking wet and needs to be drained of excess water.</li>
            <li> smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone has long</li>
            <li> This was not recovery for me, it&#x27;s going to take a long time and lots of babying to work with this breakage.  </li>
            <li> and I have dry/damaged bleach blonde hair down my back.</li>
            <li> I have very long slightly curly hair and wasted so much time and money before  found this mask.  </li>
            <li> I have had really dry straw like hair for a long time and this was my cure.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well on my dry, long hair.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other hair types, but if you have hair similar to mine then I&#x27;d recommending trying something else.</li>
            <li> Neutrogina Triple Moisture Deep Recovery hair Mask is extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> so 6 oz lasts very long time.</li>
            <li> I have very long naturally curly thick hair that tends to be dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> My hair was always healthy until I went through a bad bleaching at a salon and my hair become totally fried!</li>
            <li> I tried letting the rest of my damp hair air dry to see if that helped any.</li>
            <li> This product is just GREATTT if you have really dry hair or if you want to maintain the moisture in your hair.   </li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyway one who has dry damaged hair or suffered from lack of hydration.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like straw, just somewhat dry.</li>
            <li> I tried this because of it states it will moisturize dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length curly dry hair.  </li>
            <li> it was dry, damaged and had lots of flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say that I do let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> Without my curly hair will be dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that tends to frizz when I air dry</li>
            <li> It gets all dry and crunchy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$ on more expensive items...</li>
            <li> I have very very dry long hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down like a lot of deep conditioners do.</li>
            <li> but when i rinsed this out and let hair air dry the ends of my hair looked like hay!</li>
            <li> Lastly, this was on sale at walgreen&#x27;s for about $1 less 2 days ago when I went over.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my oils (Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Coconut Oil) and deep condition for one hour.  </li>
            <li> The  ends of my hair are very dry</li>
            <li> so it get very dry</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> The conditioner definitely helps to make it a little easier to brush out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> , A small amount in my hair defrizzes and softens my gray hair like no other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used a wide tooth comb and there were no tangles at all.</li>
            <li> By now I&#x27;ve purchased a few of these, but the last one had an ink mark on the bottom</li>
            <li> so I needed a heavy duty deep conditioner that was inexpensive to hydrate my hair.</li>
            <li> I can comb my wet hair without a fuss.</li>
            <li> I just shampooed with my regular shampoo, conditioned with Neutrogena&#x27;s TMDR Hair Mask (leaving it on for 3-5 minutes, as the directions state), rinsed, dried and curled it.</li>
            <li> I apply the product to my wet hair in sections and then seal with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily scalp (dandruff), thin , fuzzy and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair mask in the hopes of bringing life back to my really dead hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve spent a zillion over the years trying to find something.</li>
            <li> I am menopausal and spent lots trying to get my hair shiny again.</li>
            <li> My ends are very dry due to lightening my hair for the summer.</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone who has very dry and damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I rub the cream into the bottom half of my long hair, clip my hair up and then get out of the bathtub to put on moisturizer etc etc.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wear my hair down and doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too expensive, give it a shot, just don&#x27;t go in with such high hopes like I did</li>
            <li> like I said before a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Being half African, it certainly is not easy finding products that won&#x27;t dry out or weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> (the ink looked different than the ink on previous jars), also the plastic peeled off after a few uses.</li>
            <li> when you put the conditioner on, dilute it so that fragile or dry hair isn&#x27;t overweighed by the thick substance of recovery mask and breaks.  </li>
            <li> so she recommended I choose one from any other store.</li>
            <li> This May work for other hair types but didn&#x27;t work for mine.</li>
            <li> It only comes in one size, small.</li>
            <li> Its small enough to throw in your purse for traveling or overnight</li>
            <li> This is not too expensive and I don&#x27;t think its the worst thing out there, but I definitely don&#x27;t think its the best.  </li>
            <li> I have EXTREME damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that, DEFENITLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Since I have started using this, I haven&#x27;t had to use any other hair product - serums, mousse or leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s evidently not overly perfumed.</li>
            <li> And remember; a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Do not like the company, not willing to help me out what so ever.</li>
            <li> , you only need a small dab and it works well...</li>
            <li> You only get 8 ounces which is a small amount.</li>
            <li> The top part of my hair was soft but the ends look terrible.</li>
            <li> However, I will say, my thin-haired friends that have tried it found it to leave their hair heavy or greasy feeling (I like to think it&#x27;s just because they didn&#x27;t have dry hair to begin with).</li>
            <li> It made my entire new color and cut job from only 4 days ago, look disastrous.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair before applying, and I let it sit in a little longer than the suggested 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> it did seem to work little but not as expected.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product and dried my hair, I was somewhat disappointed because it still looked a little frizzy (not as frizzy, but still frizzy none the less), but then when I styled my hair like I normally do with a curling iron, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am going grey (almost completely)</li>
            <li> You do not need to use a lot because the consistency is thick, so it should last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with massive frizzies and flyaways.</li>
            <li> i have thick coarse curly hair and this product does wonders!</li>
            <li> The clarifying shampoo really stripped my hair and felt dry, I was afraid to even try to run my fingers through it.  </li>
            <li> or you may be in for a let down.</li>
            <li> and I did notice that this cut down on that</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> The directions say to use a small amount which is pretty vague.</li>
            <li> Not good enough to buy again</li>
            <li> And was a bit of a mess to apply.  </li>
            <li> have long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I have really thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I like that the container is air tight</li>
            <li> I have medium thick wavy dry hair.</li>
            <li> She used the Redken at her salon, but the one she had was a little costly for me</li>
            <li> (usually every other day)&amp;leave</li>
            <li> well a leave it on for a little longer</li>
            <li> : wash my hair in the morning, leave the mask on a little bun, do my errands, exercise, etc,</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LOOOONG way</li>
            <li> I decided to do a bunch of stuff to my hair a little too close together.</li>
            <li> it actually made my ends look less broken then before.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t like it due to the fact that the product always seems to be watered down, I would rather use Aussie 5 Minute Miracle which is cheaper and way easier/less messy to use!!</li>
            <li> I was so confused with the array of deep conditioners at the beauty isle</li>
            <li> Even after ironing it everyday</li>
            <li> Not because it is dead but because of the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Leave it on for at least 5 minutes or else there would be minimal or zero effects.</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde hair which I color and highlight often.</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and its one of the few things that I recommend to all my friends if they are having problems with their hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was still wiry and did not feel silky after I dried it.</li>
            <li> Now,  as a grey-haired senior citizen who colors her hair,  it had turned super-dry and stiff.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and kinda corse and being that i dye it (too much grey not to), it&#x27;s corser</li>
            <li> alright, it caused pretty bad breakage at the crown of my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I was pretty shocked.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair and every time I use this conditioner it ends up all tangled up at some point in the day.</li>
            <li> THEN AN ORDINARY EVERYDAY CONDITIONER FOR YOUR HAIR.  </li>
            <li> After a few minutes and my hair almost completely dry, it seemed to be worse off than it usually is.</li>
            <li> my hair was terrible and quite damaged before and now is silky soft and very managable</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything bad to my hair, the fact is, it didn&#x27;t do much of anything at all.</li>
            <li> If your hair has dried out and you are looking for a solution this is the answer!</li>
            <li> This product is no better and maybe even inferior to the conditioners that come with drugstore boxed hair dyes.</li>
            <li> Tried this deep conditioning hair mask and was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> this conditioner is moisturizing but the bottle is small and i used it up in a month.lol.</li>
            <li> I used a small amount everyday for a week and its like my hair was renewed!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday as I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> However, I would not buy this product again simply because its too expensive.</li>
            <li> Did like it sooo well, will use again to test it out :/</li>
            <li> For the past week though, I have had to wash my hair with extremely hard water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those types who has spent tons of money buying expensive products, hoping that it will tame my frizzy, damaged mane and this is the miracle in a jar I&#x27;ve been hoping for, for the fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> and I was fed up with getting the same bad results from using other conditioners.</li>
            <li> and I leave it on for at least 45 mins to and hour.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t think this item works wonders, you would at least this</li>
            <li> w/a plastic hair cap &amp; leave it on for at least 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li> leave it on for at least 15 min, rinse it off and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled.</li>
            <li> i have been using this conditioner at least once a week</li>
            <li> /&gt;To begin with, I am Hispanic/European and my hair is naturally thick, wavy, and frizzy or wire like.</li>
            <li> With my thick hair, I could be finished with this jar in 3-4 shampoo uses.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference between this and any other conditioner, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> but as you can see in the photo my hair is not at my shoulders no more!</li>
            <li> After trying this product out a few times, I did notice a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> The ONLY con about this product is that its in a small jar :(</li>
            <li> If you have seriously damaged hair dont lose hope.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something less expensive.</li>
            <li> I would curl my hair, but sadly it would just look like a CURLED, frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> The only time this has ever happened to my hair is when I use a bad shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this to others with curly hair, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any expensive additional product (like I had in the past) to protect my hair from the heat of the curling iron.</li>
            <li> The texture is very thick</li>
            <li> Now the ends appeared in worse shape than they were before I did the treatment.</li>
            <li> my hair feels greasy and heavy  as if it were dirty.</li>
            <li> The bottle however, was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to say that my hair is no better.</li>
            <li> For a while I stopped using it and switched to the Federick Fekkai Anti Breakage mask that cost me a fortune and it dried up my hair like crazy!</li>
            <li> and this one was a COMPLETELY random choice.</li>
            <li> wont be sorry with this purchase..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the name of it (sorry).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s basically just a vague &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A lot of deep conditioners unfortunately leave a nasty residue after use.</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged from coloring, highlighting and blow-drying that I was skeptical if anything could help.  </li>
            <li> However, it fails to do so even after longer than the instructed 3-minute leave-in.  </li>
            <li> To rinse this out I suggest using cold water to close the cuticle up and</li>
            <li> cold water adds shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> otherwise it does moisturize  but that artificial smell blocks my nose...</li>
            <li> that really suffers from all the processing to keep me blond.  </li>
            <li> Guess there must me sulfer or sulfites because I was puffy-eyed and miserable after a few hours of applying this to my hair...</li>
            <li> I have tried very expensive brands and they have nothing on the Triple Moisture Mask.</li>
            <li> I have tried very expensive masks from salons.  </li>
            <li> And my hair is almost impossible to brush after I get out of the shower.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I decided to try this product based on the great reviews it had. My stylist recommended I try a deep conditioning treatment at home for my over processed hair. She used the Redken at her salon, but the one she had was a little costly for me so she recommended I choose one from any other store. After I left the salon with the Redken treatment I did feel that my hair was exceptionally soft, but that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to feel after a color and cut. I went to Target and purchased this Neutrogena triple moisture hoping for the same results as the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, I am Hispanic/European and my hair is naturally thick, wavy, and frizzy or wire like. I have never found a product that worked really good at smoothing my hair out. Not even leave in smoothers work on my hair to give it that soft Asian like hair feeling. My hair is naturally medium brown with reddish highlights and in the course of 3 years, I have played around with color going to dark red, bleach blond, ash blond, and now ash brown with highlights. My hair is also long, almost reaching my lower back. After all this coloring on my hair, and using flat irons and curling irons to make it appear smooth, while just adding more damage, my hair really just felt like straw, especially at the ends. I had about 3 inches of frayed hair at the bottom which I just had cut during my last trip to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I finally decided to do my own at home deep conditioning at the advice of my stylist. I thought it would be a miraculous difference due to the fact that I couldn&#x27;t possibly damage my hair any more than it is. The directions say to use a small amount which is pretty vague. I have long hair so I had no idea how much to use. I went with two quarter sized amounts. One for the top of my hair and one for the bottom. I did not use shampoo before I did this treatment, because I wanted to see the specific results of this product not influenced by the shampoo that I use. I wet my hair before applying, and I let it sit in a little longer than the suggested 3-5 minutes. After about 8 minutes I washed off. The scent was really light and faint and floral. It felt very smooth washing off and I couldn&#x27;t wait to comb it. I used a wide tooth comb and there were no tangles at all. Then I used a blow dryer on warm high setting. After a few minutes and my hair almost completely dry, it seemed to be worse off than it usually is. Hundreds of little strands were bent out of my hair just sticking right out in triangular angles all over my head. Even smaller hairs that seem new were just sticking straight up like they were full of static. The only time this has ever happened to my hair is when I use a bad shampoo. I tried letting the rest of my damp hair air dry to see if that helped any. I went back to the  mirror and used a soft padded brush to try to smooth it out. Now the ends appeared in worse shape than they were before I did the treatment. They were wire like and sort of just peeling away from my hair. It made my entire new color and cut job from only 4 days ago, look disastrous. I applied a Paul Mitchell smoothing oil on my hair after and it helped a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that this product would smooth the frizz enough to where I would not have to use flat irons or heat to take away the frizz but unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to use it to undo the wacky texture this product gave my hair. Maybe it works for other hair types, but if you have hair similar to mine then I&#x27;d recommending trying something else.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed! I bought this and the Loreal overnight hair treatment after reading so many great reviews here. This didn&#x27;t do anything bad to my hair, the fact is, it didn&#x27;t do much of anything at all. I would say it&#x27;s comparable to many of the regular daily conditioners I&#x27;ve used. I used this and the Loreal stuff a few days apart as I wanted to get a good feel for each. Both disappointed. This must work for many, there are so many good reviews and it&#x27;s one of the higher rated masks in all the research that I did. I would say (the same as I did for the Loreal stuff) it&#x27;s not too expensive, give it a shot, just don&#x27;t go in with such high hopes like I did or you may be in for a let down. As for me, I&#x27;m still looking!</li>
            <li> Im just going to put it out there, and say that this is the best hair mask Ive used in a long time.  I have tried very expensive brands and they have nothing on the Triple Moisture Mask. I  have very corase hair that I consider to be type 4b, so I use a lot more that a dime size and I leave it on for at least 45 mins to and hour. I use the mask just like any of my deep condiditoner or hair mask. My hair feels so soft and tangle free after using this product.  This is diffenently one of my staple DC this is a product I can not be without.  I hope they never change the way this product is made. It may have some cones in it but it does my hair good :)</li>
            <li> I have very coarse and frizzy Asian hair so I use it as a leave-in instead and it works better than what it said on the jar. After I shower, I would take a dime sized, smooth it on my hair, and comb to even it out. Since using this product, I wake up everyday with my hair so smooth and silky, and no more frizziness. Yay!</li>
            <li> It works fine at first.  After a while my hair became use to it, I guess</li>
            <li> I have very long slightly curly hair and wasted so much time and money before  found this mask.  I color my hair every 5-6 months and Neutrogena mask keeps my hair shiny, soft and naturally wavy. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Miracle didn&#x27;t happen, but it leaves my hair easy to comb. I tried \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; product that is much more expensive and it wasn&#x27;t any different than this one. The texture is very thick and I have fine hair, but it never weighed it down.  October 2011: By now I&#x27;ve purchased a few of these, but the last one had an ink mark on the bottom (some number) that stained my counter (the ink looked different than the ink on previous jars), also the plastic peeled off after a few uses. I hope Neutogena won&#x27;t be skipping on the ingredients too :)</li>
            <li> This May work for other hair types but didn&#x27;t work for mine. I have medium thick wavy dry hair. I used to love this hair mask! I used this for years off and on and it seemed to work fine on my hair back then. Not sure if they may have changed the formula or maybe I&#x27;ve just tried a lot of really amazing hair masks now! I was using macadamia natural oil hair mask which does wonders for my hair but is pretty pricy so i wanted to look for a much cheaper alternative so I thought i test this one out again since I hadn&#x27;t used it in a couple years. I purchased the triple moisture deep recovery recently and used it on my hair. It felt so soft and silky gliding through my hair but when i rinsed this out and let hair air dry the ends of my hair looked like hay! It didn&#x27;t moisturize my ends very well! The top part of my hair was soft but the ends look terrible. Will be going back my now holy grail mask macadamia natural oil mask where you can purchase for cheaper at target!</li>
            <li> My hair type colored &amp; bleach highlights (maybe a bit over processed?!...): After using tens and tens of hair conditioners and masks - all price ranges, I can say this one works the best for me. It leaves my hair silky and not frizzy... Love it! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> as with all products i&#x27;ve tried for my hair, i&#x27;m still looking for something that works . my hair feels soft afer using the hair mask and easy to get the tangles out, however, beyond that i dont see any advantage.</li>
            <li> Neutrogina Triple Moisture Deep Recovery hair Mask is extremely moisturizing. I use this treatment overnight. I allow it stay in my hair for at leat 8 hrs. The next morning, i rinse it out. My hair is very soft,shiny, and deep-moisturized. It only comes in one size, small. It cost about $8. Its small enough to throw in your purse for traveling or overnight stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you need a emergency fix for your hair, this is the product to use. It will transform your dry damaged hair into beautiful healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Eh - its ok.  I have curly color treated hair.  This is not too expensive and I don&#x27;t think its the worst thing out there, but I definitely don&#x27;t think its the best.  This might be ok if you haven&#x27;t abused your hair (like I unfortunately have). I prefer Alterna&#x27;s leave-in overnight treatment.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be buying!</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS TO BE OK. I DON&#x27;T REALLY NOTICE A HUGE DIFFERENCE..</li>
            <li> My hair was naturally curly as a young child.  Now,  as a grey-haired senior citizen who colors her hair,  it had turned super-dry and stiff.  Since I finally found Triple Moisture,  which I use once a week,  my hair recovered shine, bounce,  and looks alive again.  A wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. I just used it on my hair for the first time ever and its still have it in my hair but it made my hair like SILK. I love it! I have 3c curly hair and it just works amazing. The ONLY con about this product is that its in a small jar :( i used the whole jar in one use!</li>
            <li> I have finished two bottle of this hair mask. For me, it&#x27;s more like an emergency hair repair.&lt;br /&gt;I have long and thick hair and it&#x27;s very frizzy.  Normally, the day after I use this mask, my hair would be very moisturized and less frizzy. But it would only last for one day. So I only use it before important events.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for over 2 months. Even for the price, it didn&#x27;t do much more for my hair than a regular conditioner. My last treatment cream made my hair smooth and tangle free. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, but it&#x27;s produced by Boot&#x27;s (coconut and almond). That was so much cheaper and more effective.     Instead of buying this, get a regular conditioner and use more than necessary. It&#x27;ll have the same effect. Lastly, this was on sale at walgreen&#x27;s for about $1 less 2 days ago when I went over.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use a straightener on my hair almost daily and use this about once a week.  You cannot tell that I use a straightener at all.  Also makes my hair soft and easy to pull a brush through.  Absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was like neutrogena? cant be that good? I was so confused with the array of deep conditioners at the beauty isle and this one was a COMPLETELY random choice. I had never read any reviews on it and never heard of it. Boy I got lucky. I have tried several conditioners before and none worked like this. It made my hair so soft. I have EXTREME damaged hair. Coarse hair, with a very dry scalp...with several bleach and dye jobs trying to maintain a golden blonde. Well I cut off about an inch on my hair and some layers, left this mask on for 10 min in the shower than blowed out my hair. It was like I had a new head of hair. Amazing. I should also add that I also used Biosilk serum ([[ASIN:B003E0WZOW Biosilk Silk Therapy 5.64oz]]) when I straightened so the 2 combined will work miracles. If you have seriously damaged hair dont lose hope. And with such an inexpensive price I have to give it a 5. Love.</li>
            <li> So I have a beauty blog and this was on my list to review. I&#x27;ve been trying this for about a month now and I have to say this saved my hair from dryness. First off, it comes in a really small bottle so you don&#x27;t get alot but it&#x27;s super concentrated which is great.  I have had really dry straw like hair for a long time and this was my cure. It does exactly what it is and moisterizes your hair ridicousely! It leaves it super soft and super healthy. My advice: leave it on for 1hr+ instead of just 5 mins. My hair soaks it up.  However it doesnt get reduce the number of split ends. You have to use it maximum twice a week, any more and it starts to leave it greasy and breakable. There&#x27;s about a month supply in the bottle so you got to get a new one about every month.  Other than that, DEFENITLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I must say I love it. I suffer from hair loss if I use normal conditioner. So it has been my best choice ever since I found out this solution. Just order 2 more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, fine, colored, with damaged ends that I do trim every 4/5 weeks. The  ends of my hair are very dry so I needed a heavy duty deep conditioner that was inexpensive to hydrate my hair. I googled \\&quot;best drugstore deep conditioners\\&quot; and this product popped up. I read mainly good reviews about it, so I decided to run over to Target and pick it up. After trying this product out a few times, I did notice a dramatic difference. My hair just felt more softer, healthier, and it actually looked more voluminous! The ends of my hair didn&#x27;t feel fried and raspy at all. This deep conditioner really brought my hair back to life and did I mention how great this product smells too? I would definitely consider this a awesome drugstore find and would repurchase this over. I would recommend Neutrogena triple moisture for anybody who is looking for a effective inexpensive deep conditioner. If you don&#x27;t think this item works wonders, you would at least this it&#x27;s a decent conditioner. For the price (I paid $6.99 @ Target) of this product, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it out either.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good hair mask. I have blonde highlights that became very dry with lots of breakage, this conditioner after using it twice in 5 days didn&#x27;t really make a huge difference. I think I will have to find a deeper conditioner for my hair type. I did use this product on my nieces hair and worked great - she doesn&#x27;t have chemically treated hair. I will give Neutrogena credit - the hair mask smells great and does work on virgin hair.</li>
            <li> I havent really used this as much but I do like it. The smell isnt as pleasant but it works well on my hair. It left my hair refreshed when I used it for the first time. I hope that I continue to feel satisfied</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c/4a hair with protein overload. I just started using this and after one application my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine color treated hair and this is great, it&#x27;s light and silky and luxurious.  Sometimes I use it in the shower for just a fast conditioner as opposed to leaving it on and even then there&#x27;s a noticeable difference.  Neutrogena makes great products at reasonable prices, there&#x27;s no need to spend a lot of money for a great conditioner.  I have Frederick Fekkai Technician Shampoo and Conditioner and like this much better, with this I actually see a difference.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used !!! I tried so many but this one left my hair feeling like silk for so so cheap. My hair was so bleached and fried but these actually worked. Even after ironing it everyday</li>
            <li> I have  coarse, dry, curly hair. I&#x27;ve used several hair care products from the most expensive to the cheapest ones, but have  never been happy enough with a product to stick with it. This is truly hair miracle in a jar! And for the price, you can&#x27;t ask for more. Since I have started using this, I haven&#x27;t had to use any other hair product - serums, mousse or leave-in conditioners. So, saves a ton of money and you get better hair than ever. For best results, stick to using it once or twice a week. I&#x27;m going to stick with it!!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask - 6 oz.  I wasn&#x27;t aware that Neutrogena made hair care, as well as skin care, products, but we have one right here.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while, and find that I like it: it has a pleasant scent; yet it doesn&#x27;t seem to activate any allergies, so it&#x27;s evidently not overly perfumed. The packaging is handy, easy to grasp and work with.  The product is simple to use, does not require the ultimately damaging utilization of a blow dryer, and gives good results: my hair feels as nurtured as when I have used beauty salon products that cost much more.  It can be used weekly with good results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 or 5 years now.  I have afro-textured 4a/4b, relaxed hair and this conditioner makes my hair feel like silk.  When I have lots of new growth, it melts the tangles away making detangling sooooo incredibly easy for me.  This product is a staple of mine.</li>
            <li> Once a week I strip my hair of buildup using Neutrogena&#x27;s anti-residue shampoo, and then condition with this.  Keeps my hair sleek and shiny.  Best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used and great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 2 years now and i have no regrets. I have very curly, thick hair and with just the right amount, my hair looks shiny and healthy and it is also soft. I haven&#x27;t had split ends since i began using this product. I will never stop using this. Definitely recommend this to others with curly hair, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have African American relaxed hair, which isn&#x27;t too coarse. I put it on while my hair is dry and leave in for about an hour or two (sometimes longer, the longer the better for me). This leaves my hair smelling great, feeling soft, and extremely easy to manage. I will continue to use this as a weekly deep conditioner until I find the next best thing that works for my hair. The only thing that needs to be changed is the amount per jar. I NEED MORE!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have used Triple Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner for a couple years when I ran across this product. The FIRST time I used it my hair came out the softest I have ever felt it! Once a week and my hair with use of the Triple Moisture Shampoo and Conditoner is always soft and shiny as can be! I will never use another kind of Deep Conditoner! This is now my go to!</li>
            <li> I have oily scalp, but dry-straight-thick hair because I swim twice to three times a week. The chlorine really dries out my hair even though I have used special shampoo for swimmer. I use this hair mask every time I wash my hair (usually every other day)&amp;leave it for 3 minutes before rinsing; and once a week I would apply the mask, cover my hair w/a plastic hair cap &amp; leave it on for at least 1/2 hour. It makes my hair sleek.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair a few weeks ago, so it already started out extremely dry, but it didn&#x27;t bother me that much. For the past week though, I have had to wash my hair with extremely hard water. My hair was so dry I could barely brush it afterward and after two days of not shampooing it, it still looked just as dry! I have always had oily hair after one day so this was really unusual. On a whim, I bought this product, let it sit for 4 minutes and may hair totally transformed! It&#x27;s not dry anymore, but soft and easy to brush now. So happy I bought it!</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask! It smells awesome and it leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny. I can comb my wet hair without a fuss. I recommend it! A++</li>
            <li> My hair never been so soft, I have quite damaged hair, but after few weeks just amazing! Love to keep this mask over night. Thanks</li>
            <li> I uses this weekly for extra conditioning. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down like a lot of deep conditioners do. Not the most moisturizing conditioner I have ever used, but for the price it is very good.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moGMLX7AHNV3RD]]I LOVE THIS STUFF! This is the first review I have ever left on Amazon about any product, but I decided I HAD to share with my fellow frizz-heads about why this product is so great. My hair is thick and frizzy and I have tried many shampoos and conditioners over the years to try and tame it, but none of them ever worked, until I purchased Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask. The first time I used this product and dried my hair, I was somewhat disappointed because it still looked a little frizzy (not as frizzy, but still frizzy none the less), but then when I styled my hair like I normally do with a curling iron, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! I didn&#x27;t use any expensive additional product (like I had in the past) to protect my hair from the heat of the curling iron. I just shampooed with my regular shampoo, conditioned with Neutrogena&#x27;s TMDR Hair Mask (leaving it on for 3-5 minutes, as the directions state), rinsed, dried and curled it. The hair mask along with the heat from the curling iron locked in the moisture and smoothed the hair shafts out wonderfully. My hair went from looking frizzy, to silky and smooth. Prior to using NTMDRHM (whew!) I would curl my hair, but sadly it would just look like a CURLED, frizzy mess. Before I started using this product the only time I ever received any compliments on my hair would be the occasional comment after I got it cut, but now I get compliments on it ALL THE TIME. I tried to show the difference in the before/after texture of my hair in the video I&#x27;ve posted. I know it may be a little difficult to see on the video, but this product really works great. I highly recommend you try this product for yourself. Yours truly, Ex-frizzhead</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously AMAZING. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and it has done wonders for my hair. I&#x27;m one of those types who has spent tons of money buying expensive products, hoping that it will tame my frizzy, damaged mane and this is the miracle in a jar I&#x27;ve been hoping for, for the fraction of the price. For a while I stopped using it and switched to the Federick Fekkai Anti Breakage mask that cost me a fortune and it dried up my hair like crazy! After switching back to this mask, my hair went back to it&#x27;s moisturized post-Neutrogena state. Honestly, you will get more than your money&#x27;s worth from this jar of hair mask than any other salon brand on the market. It&#x27;s affordable and it works. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair has grown out a lot stronger, making it longer than before. Being half African, it certainly is not easy finding products that won&#x27;t dry out or weigh down my hair and I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to gamble away my money on products that could do more bad than good. I just put a good amount on the ends of my hair (never the stop or it will make your scalp greasy) leave it on for at least 15 min, rinse it off and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I go to cosmetology school and wanted blond hair. The instructor bleached my hair 4 times in a row. Imagine the damage I received from that! My hair felt like a wig that was thrown into a closet for months. I bought this at walgreens on sale. I left it in for 30 mins and my hair felt amazing. You can run your hand through it. I even bought a shower cap (hello kitty of course) and I sleep with this in my hair over night. To rinse this out I suggest using cold water to close the cuticle up and cold water adds shine to your hair. :) I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Having relaxed hair my hair is really dry and regular conditioner just does&#x27;nt cut it for my hair.After shampooing i smooth this all threw out my hair and put a plastic cap on then let it sit for 10 15 minutes  after you wash it out you can feel the softness compared to before you put it in your hair.  This product is just GREATTT if you have really dry hair or if you want to maintain the moisture in your hair.   Not expensive at all and worth every penny</li>
            <li> Made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Wednesday of this week (today is Friday) after reading reviews that said it worked, fixed damaged hair, etc. What I want you to know is this stuff is A-MAZING! I am 31 yo and my hair has always been fine, shiny and strong. Unfortunately I am going grey (almost completely) so I am dying my hair more than I ever have before. Between the dye, the blow dryer, the flat iron and my time on the beach my hair had literally turned into straw. I had tried all kinds of rememdies to fix it to include throwing avacado and mayo on my hair (which turned into a funny profile pic on fb!). Nothing worked until now. This product is priceless in my opinion- the return on your investment is worth every penny. I took the mask and put it on my hair for an hour Wednesday night with a shower cap over it to hold in the heat from my scalp. I rinsed my hair (did not wash it) that night and the next morning I washed and conditioned it again with the mask. Today I did the same and the results are perfection. If your hair has dried out and you are looking for a solution this is the answer!</li>
            <li> I just received the Mask it smells good. I haven&#x27;t used it just yet but I hope it works just great for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that most reviews are from those with fine hair so i didn&#x27;t have very good reviews to go by. My hair is very thick and kinda corse and being that i dye it (too much grey not to), it&#x27;s corser then it used to be. This product is no better and maybe even inferior to the conditioners that come with drugstore boxed hair dyes. My hair is shoulder-length and i used about a Tablespoon-full of it, so not a tiny bit as others indicate for their fine hair. It left my hair nice but not nearly as good as some salon brands leave it. It&#x27;s okay, that&#x27;s all. Worth the price if you bought it at the local drug store and didn&#x27;t have to pay the shipping. I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll get it again, maybe since there isn&#x27;t much out there that doesn&#x27;t have an extra zero in the price...  I give it 3-1/2 Stars</li>
            <li> I use a deep conditioner as my daily conditioner because of my extremely dry and chemically damaged hair. I have tried dozens of products, but I keep coming back to Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Moisture hair mask. It leaves my hair incredibly soft and smooth, removes tangles and knots instantly, and smells great. Best of all, it is way cheaper than most brands. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very good product, hair get silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> love it wish they had larger ones this finish too quickly for me within two weeks am i using too much.  probably am that&#x27;s how good it is. lol</li>
            <li> Thank God for a moisturizer that works.   i have super curly hair and this help manage it and smells great.</li>
            <li> Not good enough to buy again</li>
            <li> Personally, I have always loved this.  It&#x27;s great for my thick, coarse hair.  However, I will say, my thin-haired friends that have tried it found it to leave their hair heavy or greasy feeling (I like to think it&#x27;s just because they didn&#x27;t have dry hair to begin with).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this item twice. It works very well on my hair especially now that its winter. I use this as a deep conditioning and then follow with coconut oil. The results are amazing. My hair stays hydrated and strong and doesn&#x27;t get brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyway one who has dry damaged hair or suffered from lack of hydration. Also, this is part of my hair growth regimen! Very low maintenance.</li>
            <li> esta crema es lo mejor cuando viene a hidratar tu cabello extremadamente seco, en combinacion con shampoo organix para cabello seco es lo mejor</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that recently became overprocessed. It&#x27;s not like straw, just somewhat dry. After reading several reviews, I purchased this product in attempt to improve the texture of my hair. I&#x27;m afraid to say that my hair is no better. I have been using this product once or twice a week for two months without any results.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was hoping for a lot deeper, noticeable conditioning. I don&#x27;t see any difference between this and any other conditioner, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I tried this because of it states it will moisturize dry hair. However this did nothing for my curly hair. The consistency was like a thin cream conditioner but it felt more like an over watered-down product on my hair. It did nothing to moisturize or even condition my hair. If I had not paid $7 and instead bought it from the $1 store then I would say it was worth the dollar. I do not recommend this, but I do recommend garnier frutis hair mask which smells delicious and makes my hair feel great and cost half the price of this watery stuff.</li>
            <li> Tried this deep conditioning hair mask and was not impressed at all. The container it comes in means you take a huge risk of getting all the contents wet when opening in the bath or shower especially since you need to dig in with a wet hand. I always feel like when I open this container it is soaking wet and needs to be drained of excess water. Maybe I don&#x27;t like it due to the fact that the product always seems to be watered down, I would rather use Aussie 5 Minute Miracle which is cheaper and way easier/less messy to use!!</li>
            <li> hi all, it has strong fragrance smell. someone allergic to fragrance is not recommended. otherwise it does moisturize  but that artificial smell blocks my nose...</li>
            <li> This conditioner is by far my favorite.  It smells fantastic and leaves my hair incredibly soft.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy for everyday use with my hair type, but I use it several times a week and love it.</li>
            <li> make hair very smooth and all my friends like this product. if there is a chance I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am African-American and have wavy to curly hair. I love that this product is relatively inexpensive and leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized. All of the ingredients aren&#x27;t the best, but for the price I think this product is good. I apply the product to my wet hair in sections and then seal with coconut oil. I cover my hair with a shower cap to allow my body heat to help the conditioner penetrate my hair strands better. I leave it on for anywhere from 30 minutes to overnight and then rinse.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my natural Afro textured hair. Makes my hair soft and smells amazing, I do recommend to EVERYONE</li>
            <li> I got this not long ago and have been using it once a week as instructed- well a leave it on for a little longer: wash my hair in the morning, leave the mask on a little bun, do my errands, exercise, etc, end of day: wash hair again to rinse it out! but bottom line, it leaves my hair feeling healthy and really soft... I have curly hair and I&#x27;m constantly battling humidity and dryness, now I think I&#x27;ve found the solution!</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money did nothing on my hair just like a normal conditioner I didn&#x27;t like the product May it&#x27;s jus me but this is the worst product I have ever used from neutrogena</li>
            <li> For the most part, I like this product. It smell great and provided nice slip on my chemical free kinky African America hair. I find that I have to use a whole lot of it to sufficiently coat my hair. It did not leave my hair as soft as I like and did not give my hair nearly enough moisture. I like it well enough to use the rest of it, but will be searching for something better for my hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week and my hair definitely does feel softer! My ends are very dry due to lightening my hair for the summer. And my hair is almost impossible to brush after I get out of the shower. Not because it is dead but because of the texture of my hair. The conditioner definitely helps to make it a little easier to brush out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to see more progress as I use the product more! (:</li>
            <li> this conditioner is moisturizing but the bottle is small and i used it up in a month.lol. i would purchase again but i found something better.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and this product feels best on my hair - I have tried many!  It detangles and conditions.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I put this in my coarse like hair from dying my hair so much and it revived my hair back to silky and smooth feeling :D</li>
            <li> I have thick 4AB  hair and this stuff is amazing amazing. It gives me loads if moisture and shine for DAYS and it makes detangling a breeze.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have thick long Asian hair, but this did absolutely nothing for my hair. I was very disappointed. Will be trying another product.</li>
            <li> I bought this Neutrogena Hair Mask and the Daily Deep Conditioner--this did absolutely nothing to my hair. I might be exaggerating a little, but if felt like I put it in and after keeping it in for a couple of hours it just came right out. When I used the Daily Deep Conditioner, I put it in and then washed it out after the remainder of my shower, which was like 10 min. HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> I use this hair mask as a conditioner after shampoo for the last couple of years now. It does a great job for me. I have a very oily scalp (dandruff), thin , fuzzy and curly hair. I use a very tiny amount in shower, keep it on for a couple of minutes and rinse. It doesn&#x27;t wear my hair down and doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue after my hair is dry. It smells very nice. I tried many many other conditioners, none of them was comparable. Only a tiny amount is enough for all my hair so 6 oz lasts very long time. Great deal, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length curly dry hair.  I used a flat iron on it and damaged it... it was dry, damaged and had lots of flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser did a keratin smoothing treatment which lasted about 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found and used this mask and noticed a huge difference the first time I used it!  Any flyaways it didn&#x27;t take care of I just applied more of the mask to the dry hair and viola, soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked just as well as the keratin smoothing treatment for the damage and flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying more of this mask!</li>
            <li> After several weeks of using different brands of \\&quot;repair shampoos\\&quot; and \\&quot;intense conditioners\\&quot; with little to no success I found this product.  I have only used it once and I can see and feel a BIG difference in my over processed hair.  Even my husband could see and feel the difference.  I will say that I do let my hair air dry (I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer unless I absolutely have too). I don&#x27;t know if that has something to do with it or not.  I would recommend this product to anyone without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time. I am coloring my hair many years so it get very dry and I looked like puddle. Started to make a research and find this mask. So even after first use you actually can see result, my hair getting more shiny and soft ! Very like the product! Definitely gonna buy it again! Thank you very much!!!!</li>
            <li> best product i&#x27;ve ever used; not greasy at all; and really a cheap price!! oh, and the amount is very huge~</li>
            <li> I love this deep conditioner! I have curly African American hair that can get dry  (somewhere between 3b and 3c). I used this today for the first time and my hair is so soft (when it is normally a bit dry after I give it a good shampoo and conditioning) and light and it actually added volume! I would definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this stuff! It glides right through my hair like butter. Just the kind of slip i like. Smells great and leaves my hair super soft when i deep condition overnight. Love it!</li>
            <li> For some reason this product did not work well on my colored hair. After reading all the reviews , i was quite excited hoping this product would fix my dry n brittle hair. it did seem to work little but not as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I generally like Neutrogena products and I was fed up with getting the same bad results from using other conditioners. This one was not different. I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement at all.</li>
            <li> Leave it on for at least 5 minutes or else there would be minimal or zero effects. I rub the cream into the bottom half of my long hair, clip my hair up and then get out of the bathtub to put on moisturizer etc etc. Only then I rinse it off at the basin :)</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product a few weeks (one or two times a week) and it works pretty well. My hair is naturally curly but I wear it straight most days, so I use a lot of heat. This product seems more like a &amp;#34;good conditioner&amp;#34; rather than deep recovery.</li>
            <li> Really does work,,, impressed. my hair was terrible and quite damaged before and now is silky soft and very managable</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, greasy on the roots but dry at  the ends. I  was looking for a good and cheap moisturizing treatment. I read many reviews about Nutrogena Triple Moisture at the web and Amazon. Every time i use it ( i just put it from the middles through ends) my hair feels greasy and heavy  as if it were dirty. I think it most be for very dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I like to try different hair treatment product, and it is my first time to try Neutrogena&#x27;s hair product, and it is a good experience, good product, I think I will continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good deep moisturizer and found all the reviews for this product. I purchased this at my local CVS for $8 and its ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! I have thin blonde hair which I color and highlight often. This past treatment, my hair started to really break off. I used a small amount everyday for a week and its like my hair was renewed! This product is very inexpensive from the other deep conditioners ive used (Alterna and Redken) and it doesnt leave my hair weighed down or greasy. My daughter was amazed on how much it helped my hair so she started to use it and loves it too!&lt;br /&gt;You wont be sorry with this purchase..I promise! :o)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well on my dry, long hair.  And was a bit of a mess to apply.  I much prefer the Rusk Deepshine Luster.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (to fragrances mostly) and this doesn&#x27;t break me out at all.  I also have severely dry hair and using this 3 days a week has helped to make my hair a bit softer and MUCH easier to brush out.</li>
            <li> Love this product, best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had for my hair. Bought it to make my hair color stand out; however I use it on my daughters hair as well. After it is rinsed out, the hair is so soft and easy to comb through. I would recommend this product to all who likes healthy hair, regardless of your race.</li>
            <li> I use this to condition my hair after every shampoo and it conditions and detangles really well without feeling greasy. It may be too much conditioning for people with normal hair but mine is dry, coarse &amp; frizzy and this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve found for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry. I use this a few times a week and it works like a charm! Don&#x27;t waste your $$ on more expensive items... this is the best conditioning treatment! :)</li>
            <li> I have very very dry long hair. This product added moisture. For the price I would say it is one of my favorites. I would recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I used this mask after a clarifying wash on my 4b/4c hair.  This is the first I&#x27;ve used clarifying shampoo since going natural over a year ago and I usually use sulfate free shampoo or co-wash with conditioner.  The clarifying shampoo really stripped my hair and felt dry, I was afraid to even try to run my fingers through it.  After applying the mask and a conditioning bag for about five minutes in the shower, I could then run my fingers through it and it felt buttery soft.  This stuff is amazing and worth every penny of the $6 I paid at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Do its job. Hair feel moisturized and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone has long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;s s s</li>
            <li> I wish they sold these in bigger containers.  The conditioning mask is great, but the 6 oz goes fast!  I use this everyday as I have thick, curly hair and it&#x27;s completely gone within a week and a half.  I will have to revert back to the Biolage so I don&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for years and its one of the few things that I recommend to all my friends if they are having problems with their hair.  I have fine hair and often found that deep conditioners left my hair feeling greasy and weighed down for a couple of days after use.  However, this deep conditioner, I sleep with in a wrap over night and rinse out in the morning with a light shampoo and my hair feels like it has just had a good haircut - bouncy, healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I regularly use this product to deep condition my hair. I do it about once a week. It is amazing! I leave in on overnight and wash it out the next day. My hair ends up soft, shiny, and detangled. Without my curly hair will be dry and brittle. This product is amazing and for only 7 dollars it is a steal.</li>
            <li> I have highly color treated hair and have tried so many conditioning products in the past.  I have fine, straight hair (but I have a lot of it) that really suffers from all the processing to keep me blond.  I can&#x27;t believe this really inexpensive deep hair mask is the best one.  I have tried very expensive masks from salons.  This one really delivers and my hair feels non frizzy, soft and like hair should.  The cuticule is sealed down and my hair looks healthy.  I left it on for 3-5 minutes while I was in the shower and then rinsed well.  I did decide to give my hair a final cool water rinse to close the cuticle and that may have helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the jar says to use once a week so we&#x27;ll see how it is the next time i wash my hair.  I am going to be very tempted to use it every time if needed.  The difference is that great. I am a believer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m a product junkie. I&#x27;m at a stage where I am still trying to find what works best for my dry, thick hair. I stopped perming my hair about four year ago. I had this little jar sitting in my drawn for quite some time now and used it for the first time three days ago. This hair mask is amazing!!!! I love it. My hair was noticeably shiny, softer and the slip was incredible. You do not need to use a lot because the consistency is thick, so it should last you quite a while. My only reason for not giving it five stars is because I feel that it should come in a bigger jar, but like I said before a little goes a long way so it&#x27;s not a big deal. In addition, this hair mask is a great alternative to the Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque which is also excellent, but pricey.</li>
            <li> I have very long naturally curly thick hair that tends to be dry and coarse. Frizz is an issue with me as is just getting a large tooth comb through it even with conditioner on it in the shower. I have a cabinet full of conditioners that promised soft curls, more moisture and less frizz that did not work. This stuff is wonderful and I use it every time I wash my hair. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Amazing, completely fixed my hair after being processed and bleached so many times and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get it to help. It&#x27;s an amazing product and I plan on buying it again once I run out!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LOOOONG way and I have dry/damaged bleach blonde hair down my back. It will weigh your hair down if you use too much, but if you get the amount correct-it is the perfect mask at a fantastic price. I pay triple for other top brand masks and this one is just as good!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. I was buying an asian leave in conditioner that was awesome. I wanted to try something less expensive. I read all the great reviews and tried this one. It was OK but not nearly as great as the comments said. It is OK, will not buy again. The other one is worth the money, especially because you only need a little but and it lasts a long time. I can&#x27;t remember the name of it (sorry).</li>
            <li> smize while you moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s super light! does the job. smells amazing. 10/10 would do again best deep hair mask that i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioner. Smells great and leaves my hair feeling moisturized. I use once a week and it really helps.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old has long curly hair and I have tried many products, including very expensive ones, but this one is the best by far.  I was glad to find it because she uses pretty much the whole jar on her hair, but it&#x27;s worth it-keeps it soft and it&#x27;s defintely easier to comb.</li>
            <li> good scent and good body, its not sticky and very affordable.. i think it is some thing that many people can but and juts use it daily..instead of paying 45 dollars o rso...</li>
            <li> It was not a bad product, but not great either... I would use this product on a daily basis if it was cheaper. I thought for my hair, it wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; to be used just once or twice a week...</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes your hair so soft. I love the cream and the smell is amazing. I think that this is one of the best conditioners out there. I like that the container is air tight I can keep it in my shower and it is readily available.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my hair feel so soft and moisturizes very well. I would recommend this product for the price and quality! And remember; a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good conditioner for a lot of people but not for my hair. I have long, thin hair and every time I use this conditioner it ends up all tangled up at some point in the day.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and it worked so good i got back on Amazon and order 3 more jars for my daughters.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a new deep conditioner and Triple Moisture is my new favorite.  I have curly hair that tends to frizz when I air dry and I did notice that this cut down on that which is great given the toll the humidity has been taking on my hair.  I still need to follow up with a gel of finishing spray.  I like the smell but it&#x27;s basically just a vague &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; scent, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything in particular.  The consistency is great though. Some deep conditioners are so light that you practically need a whole handful for one treatment but a large coin sized amount of this will do the trick.  The quantity is alright for the price though I could definitely find it cheaper in a local store. Not a bad choice for when you don&#x27;t want to pay for a salon quality product.</li>
            <li> not for the customers at all. Love the product.  Do not like the company, not willing to help me out what so ever.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time in the pool and my hair really pays for it. It gets all dry and crunchy. I bought this hair mask in the hopes of bringing life back to my really dead hair. I have used it twice and I already see a huge difference. My hair is soft, shiny, and healthy, and the effect lasts for a while. As an extra bonus, this stuff actually smells good!</li>
            <li> A lot of deep conditioners unfortunately leave a nasty residue after use. They might make your hair look fabulous but you absolutely can&#x27;t let anyone touch your beautiful tresses because they feel totally disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats why I love this hair mask! Its perfect in so many ways.... During the summer I use it once every 3 weeks (or more frequently if I&#x27;ve been using a lot of heat and styling products) and during the winter about every 9 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is the winter static prevention.&lt;br /&gt;My thin hair is incredibly prone to become static and on some days I look electrocuted by mid afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad thats under control now because of this.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works very effectively and smells great!</li>
            <li> Product is very nice and smells great.  The bottle however, was broken when I received it. Luckily the bottle is double reinforced.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and am attempting to grow it out. Because my hair is fine I get a lot of breakage and split ends when I try to grow it out. I have been using this product as a deep conditioner and am so impressed with the results. I only apply it to my ends and not the roots so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. My ends are looking to much better, my hair is breaking less, and I am getting far less if any spit ends! I highly recommend this product. Plus it smells amazing!! I have been able to successfully grow my hair now without having to chop it off because the ends are so damaged. I need a hair cut now to freshen my ends up quite a bit but as you can see in the photo my hair is not at my shoulders no more! Yay!</li>
            <li> I have relaxed color treated hair, I have used many deep conditioners and this one is the best.  I started my healthy hair journey in March of 2011 and began using it then.  It leaves my hair soft, manageable and it smells great.  I mix it with my oils (Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Coconut Oil) and deep condition for one hour.  It works great and I am very pleased with this product.  I just wish it came in an economy size since it is costly to use it weekly.</li>
            <li> When I rinse it out of my hair, my hair is the silkiest smoothest thing I&#x27;ve ever felt. However, once my hair is dry I have noticed it has more split ends and seems very &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; in spots, although I haven&#x27;t colored my hair recently, and barely ever use heat products.&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product, my hair never felt so dry at the ends and certain spots.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like this product adds something to make your hair feel soft at first, but slowly actually dries it out.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This product works as well as people say it does. excellent for very dry hair. Restores the moisture and life in your hair. Mine hair is heat and chemically damages, but this product really made a difference after using it only twice. It&#x27;s now part of my routine.</li>
            <li> Feels great but it hasn&#x27;t helped my damaged hair</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve spent a zillion over the years trying to find something. Some products were good, but nothing as good as this one. I gave up on getting the shine back in my hair. I am menopausal and spent lots trying to get my hair shiny again. For years I have used the wonderufl Regis  Designline Olive Oil Conditioner which I got from SmartStyles salons. But the hair acclimates to a product and my hair started needing some extra moisture.  I went on Amazon, looked at all the great reviews for this.. After first using it (10 min in hair),  the tangles were out of my hair with a lustrous feel to it. The big surprise is I&#x27;ve got the best shine back in my hair. I am talking about the shine I had when I was in my youth!!!!!  Going to tell all my friends about this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissapointed. I figured after the wonderful reviews this product received it would be a winner. It did nothing to help my processed hair and it was frizzy after blowdrying . Not thrilled.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. i purchased it to use after i highlighted my hair to reduce damage. i can tell a huge difference from the last product i used even from a salon. theres a lot in there and u dont need much so it lasts a long time, smells good, and u can notice instantly a difference in the health of your hair!</li>
            <li> I got this product yesterday and used it only once but my hair feels so much different. I went to a place and they damaged my hair to the point where even experts couldn&#x27;t even get it back to normal. Just after one use I can feel and see a major differance in my hair :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who has very dry and damaged hair!</li>
            <li> i been using this product for a while now and it works and does exactly what it says it will do...it actually replaced the pantene provene curly series i used to buy... and the best thing is that you dont need to saturate your hair with this stuff to get results, you only need a small dab and it works well...i am satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with massive frizzies and flyaways. I live in a dry climate, so humidity isn&#x27;t a problem, but my hair always feels dry. I was using Aussie 3 minute miracle, but wanted to switch things up. A friend recommended this. I applied and then shaved my legs and plum iced my feet before rinsing (I figured that would give it time to set), and the scent was HEAVENLY! Not overpowering or chemically, just wonderful.  I am not seeing a major difference in my hair, but enough that I continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask. I have searched long and hard for a good hair mask, and this is definitely an excellent one. I like it because it leaves your hair so smooth, and it actually re-hydrates hair. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, I try something else, but I always come back to this. I have really thick long hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this hair treatment for my sister. She used it on her damaged hair a few times (from dyes) before her hair became normal again. She loves the product as it left her hair very soft and manageable. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and you get such great results without any heavy hair. You can sit with a heat cap or ust let in for five minutes.  Great stuff</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTEY NOTHING SPECIAL, MAGICAL OR DIFFERENT THEN AN ORDINARY EVERYDAY CONDITIONER FOR YOUR HAIR.  I&#x27;m SO DISAPPOINTED.  I HAD DONE BLOND HIGHLIGHTS IN MY DK BRWN HAIR AND FRIED IT AND IT NEEDED SOME MAJOR TLC, I BOUGHT A VARIETY OF &amp;#34;DEEP MOISTURE&amp;#34; CONDITIONERS, AND THIS WAS PROBABLY THE MOST USELESS.  I use this as a simple conditioner for the tips of my hair to help detangle at the end of my shower so I don&#x27;t waster the money. But there is nothing special or &amp;#34;extra moisturizing&amp;#34; about this stuff at all.</li>
            <li> so allergic. Guess there must me sulfer or sulfites because I was puffy-eyed and miserable after a few hours of applying this to my hair...so dissappointed. So if you are sensitive at all, please heed my advice and maybe not risk it. thank you.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and perfect</li>
            <li> Its good, and leaves hair soft, but Morrocan Oil for me is much better. bought 2 because my sister does not like Morrocan, prefers this one. so, each of us have different opinions.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best ones I have used, It really works and I have used it now for over 4 years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracie Bobb, Philadelphia, Pa.</li>
            <li> Doenst really deep condtion</li>
            <li> i have thick coarse curly hair and this product does wonders! My hair is now super soft and it actually helps with the frizz. I would highly recommend this to anyone with hair like mine!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a great conditioner! I wish it was a bit bigger but it is worth the price! I recommend this for all hair types, especially African-American hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used couple of stuffs on my hair cause it has been damaged so bad for a while. I chose this one by the reviews and it really works great! 200% better than I expected!!</li>
            <li> I decided to do a bunch of stuff to my hair a little too close together. I bleached it, put in henna, bleached it again, put in henna, then died it. Ugh. This is good thick conditioner. Made it feel perfectly soft. I&#x27;d recommend it for damaged hair. I&#x27;m using it once a week or so but there&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t use it every day if you wanted. I&#x27;ve also used it to comb through in the shower for detangling.</li>
            <li> I fried my hair.  I overprocessed with a relaxer and then added a semi permanent color on top!  Not good.  I thought my only choice was a big pair of scissors, my hair was so crispy.  I searched online and this product was recommended next to another masque that costs over $100 a jar.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Neurogena!  Left it on overnight and the next day, my hair was silky and manageable.  Almost a week later and my hair is returning to its natural state despite my limited use of hot styling tools.  This stuff reminds me of that Hair crack, Queen Latifah used on Andy McDowell in the movie Beauty Shop.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair that often gets tangled and breaks off easily. So after hearing from a friend, I should try this hair mask. I thought okay and was very surprised. It really made my hair soft and I could tell that my hair had improved through one use when I flat ironed it. Gone were the tangles and dryness. My hair no longer felt like brillowpad and seemed to be recovering. However, I would not buy this product again simply because its too expensive. You only get 8 ounces which is a small amount. With my thick hair, I could be finished with this jar in 3-4 shampoo uses. I believe that I can find an equally good deep conditioner with much more. It was good but I&#x27;ll probably keep looking for something with a greater value that will last longer.</li>
            <li> This was a new product for me.  I do purchase Neutrogena shampoo and conditioner but needed a moisture treatment as well.  I do like this product and would recommend this to others to try.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night and I have to say I&#x27;m already in love. I only used it for about 7 minutes, I am too scared to use it longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I really prefer all natural products, but this really has saved/softened my hair on occasion when it really needs help. I leave it in for up to half hour, then wash out with shampoo, and my hair is SO soft.</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged from coloring, highlighting and blow-drying that I was skeptical if anything could help.  I tried this product and after regular use over 1-2 months, my new-growth hair is protected and my existing hair is noticeably improved.  As each month passes and my damaged hair is increasingly cut off, my hair has never looked better.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love this product -- but give it time and use it regularly -- you&#x27;ll see results ovre 4-8 weeks.  Be patient.</li>
            <li> i have been using this conditioner at least once a week and it really makes my hair feel soft, especially after all the straightening and blow drying i do each week. i will definitely order more when i run out.</li>
            <li> This is the best I ever used. I like it very much. It makes my life full of good-hair day.</li>
            <li> smells great, helps with breakage and split ends</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner it&#x27;s the best I really can&#x27;t explain what it does you have to see for yourself</li>
            <li> Did like it sooo well, will use again to test it out :/</li>
            <li> it is so good! My hair is so much softer than before.</li>
            <li> My hair was always healthy until I went through a bad bleaching at a salon and my hair become totally fried! Your supposed to use this once a week but I was using this as my daily conditioner after shampoo and in a couple weeks I switched too the recommended once a week treatment and my hair looked and felt so much better! there was no frizz and the damage looked practically gone!</li>
            <li> Love this! Have used it for years and always come back for it</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review with the fact that I have fine, straight hair.  That said, it is reasonable to expect that this thick conditioner, for its price, would out-perform regular conditioners.  However, it fails to do so even after longer than the instructed 3-minute leave-in.  I have tested leaving in with another product (Garnier Fructis, Sleek and Shine Conditioner) and had better results, measured by how easily it is to run a comb to smooth the conditioner over my tangled hair and how smooth it is after blow-drying.  I am using comparatively the same amount of product for each, so effectively, I am spending four times more for this 6-oz product, which performs no better than Garnier&#x27;s 24-oz Sleek and Shine Conditioner at Amazon&#x27;s current pricings.  DISCLAIMER: I cannot attest the same results for other hair and/or hair types, only mine.  I am not affiliated with Garnier...just sharing my direct and practical experience with others how fortunate I was to have found another product that works well and saves me on costs.</li>
            <li> In an effort to stop spending money on high end products, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in the regular stores looking for great products. The scene has changed from when I was kid. Back then, grocery/drug store brands weren&#x27;t very good. However, it has been a real treat trying all the products. Some are pretty awesome and work just as well as the salon brands, and some drug store brands work even better. This Neutrogena is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve tried in a long time. The smell is candy-like but light and doesn&#x27;t linger; the texture of the conditioner is like cream, and the result was super easy to comb hair that dried nice and soft. There was no need for leave in conditioner or smoothing hair serum after this. What a treasure this is! I hope others have as good of luck as I did. My hair is super dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be too conditioning for people with fine, oily or limp hair textures though.</li>
            <li> It made my hair super soft and it smells really good. it actually made my ends look less broken then before.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot from this product since it was so highly rated. I was disappointed when I used it. My hair didn&#x27;t feel any different  than if I used a really cheap conditioner. My hair was still wiry and did not feel silky after I dried it. I had better luck with the suave Moroccan oil products which is half the price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s affordable and leaves my thick 4a/b natural hair feeling super soft, silky, moisturized. It also smells really great. I find that most deep conditioners that say &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; on them tend to be really hard for me to rinse out and leave a film behind but this only took maybe 2 minutes for me to rinse and there was no film. I will definitely repurchase this item again and again. You don&#x27;t have to order in Amazon either. You can get this product at any drugstore or Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for dry fly away hair and repair of color treated hair for many years..Have tried others and they do not do the job that the Triple Moisture does...I was very happy to find it still available as have not found it in stores for a few years...now my hair is happy and silky again..</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this item and I wish it would have worked better for me.  I am gray/blonde and my hair needed some conditioning so I read the reviews and one person even said they kept it on all night.  DON&#x27;T DO THIS.  iF your hair is really dry or brittle and you put a softening agent like this one on it, it will make it soft alright, it caused pretty bad breakage at the crown of my hair.  Now, some could say, it wasn&#x27;t this, but I know it happened right after I washed it out.  It was very very soft but so soft it broke since it was dry.  I have never had a real case of breakage or split ends so I was pretty shocked.  My husband noticed it and said, you better check out your hair.  There&#x27;s got to be something in this product that softens too much.  I am living proof.  I take good care of my hair, and I will never put anything Neutrogena on my hair again.  Glad it worked for some people.  I recommend Purelology shampoo, conditioner, and when you put the conditioner on, dilute it so that fragile or dry hair isn&#x27;t overweighed by the thick substance of recovery mask and breaks.  This was not recovery for me, it&#x27;s going to take a long time and lots of babying to work with this breakage.  I hope this helps people who really need their hair replenished.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I felt the impact on my hair instantly. I have curl hair and it was very easy to untangle after this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because it was so affordable for a deep conditioner and still had great reviews. I was not disappointed. It worked very well. It left my hair feeling soft silky and shiny. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Came so quick! &amp; worked wonders on my hair. Smells great too. It was smaller than expected but over all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this at target. Replaced my regular conditioner with this and after one week my hair is amazing!!!! Super soft and shiny. Makes my blonde hair shine like the sun. Will buy this again and again</li>
            <li> Easy, light, hair is immediately softer, and moister, will definitely recommend to family or friend. Very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year and love it!, A small amount in my hair defrizzes and softens my gray hair like no other conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have fine, overly processed hair and I use this as a daily conditioner. It&#x27;s one of the few that really works well on my hair! Great for right after a bleach job, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this product but my hair didn&#x27;t take to well to it. It made my hair very stringy and dry. Used it twice and both times it was just disgusting.</li>
