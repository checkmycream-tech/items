            <li>Great fast shipping, great product, great seller!</li>
            <li>I Loved Piercing My Lip With This .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easier to fit inside the needle and just have it slide through, otherwise it was a very good kit.</li>
            <li>I really liked this starter kit.</li>
            <li>The clamps are nice and metal though.</li>
            <li>I was successfully able to pierce my own septum with this kit.</li>
            <li>No biggie though, I was able to work around it.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find a better value.</li>
            <li>I was able to painlessly pierce my nipples.</li>
            <li>but overall this is a wonderful product for the price</li>
            <li>the quality of items seems OK</li>
            <li>If your worried about infection, be sure to use antibacterial soap and sea salt rinse.</li>
            <li>This kit was pretty good, it came with everything.</li>
            <li>It was also good that it came with a good amount of disinfectants, super happy and excited thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure everything would have worked fine and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good set for a beginner except for the captive rings.</li>
            <li>I still have the captive bead rings, I love them!</li>
            <li>The rings they supplied are ridiculosly huge  for ANY kind of piercing (helix, septum, possibly a lip if you like that kind of jewlrey.)</li>
            <li>Came in quickly and nothing was damaged, can&#x27;t wait to get snakebites.</li>
            <li>I love this kit, you get a pair of really good clamps, 2 nice sharp needles, I was able to pierce my own lips with only a slight pinch!</li>
            <li>Clamp (in sterile packing), two needles (in sterile packing), two 14 gauge captive bead rings (also in sterile packing), two large alcohol sheets, two packets of lube and two corks for safe piercing.</li>
            <li>I used it to pierced my navel and used a smaller needle to pierce my ears and the cork came in handy when piercing my ears.</li>
            <li>Sterile and fun.  </li>
            <li>Other good, sanitary product.</li>
            <li>The needles are nice and sharp and the product comes quickly...</li>
            <li>Everything was great except for the needles, they were pretty dull.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s pictured is exactly what I received except for the plugs that you pierce into are cork and not whatever material is shown.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but the captive rings they include are just wayyyy too big to fit in the needles, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The metal wasn&#x27;t smooth enough around the edges</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>When I opened my package there were no piercing needles which was basically the main component of this kit, everything else I could have done with out but really...</li>
            <li>Most professionals agree that gloves are not necessary if you are piercing ONLY yourself.</li>
            <li>The clamps were good a little rough</li>
            <li>then I realized the captive rig wasn&#x27;t wide enough to fit.</li>
            <li>The rings were a little too big, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I have already done 4 piercing with it so far.</li>
            <li>Some rubber gloves would make this 100% complete</li>
            <li>...nothing beats a training piercer!&lt;br /&gt;People may talk trash about the legitimacy of a qualified piercing artist but let me tell you I was a professional tattooist with three shops</li>

            <li> (And if you are not a professional that is the only person you should pierce anyway.)Kudos to metro tattoo for endorsing self piercing AND responsibility!</li>
            <li> I honestly only used the needle from this kit, I had all other things prepared</li>
            <li> i felt only a little pinch.</li>
            <li> Never got infected, and the hollow needle went in like a breeze.</li>
            <li> It  Was Sharp &amp;</li>
            <li> , i recommend being very careful with the needles in you</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that I didn&#x27;t like the clamps it came with.</li>
            <li> The needle&#x27;s were very very sharp</li>
            <li> Came with everything it shows, including metal clamps (unlike some previous reviews).</li>
            <li> but I would not recommend buying from this seller after this, I just feel it was ridiculous to have to wait that long for an incomplete order.</li>
            <li> the earrings are somewhat small, so pierce accordingly!</li>
            <li> I got several infections from this kit, the piercings that come with it are some sort of fake Chinese made metal crap that just should not be put into your body.</li>
            <li> The Ball Was Hard To Put In \\&quot;!</li>
            <li> It was a bloody mess</li>
            <li> i jabbed my ears wrong</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was successfully able to pierce my own septum with this kit. unlike the photo the tongs are not metal, but plastic. The rings they supplied are ridiculosly huge  for ANY kind of piercing (helix, septum, possibly a lip if you like that kind of jewlrey.) I honestly only used the needle from this kit, I had all other things prepared but I wanted extra sanitary products. No instruction kit so I had no idea what the blue plugs were for as well. Other good, sanitary product.</li>
            <li> This kit was a great value. It comes with everything you need. My only complaint was that I didn&#x27;t like the clamps it came with. The metal wasn&#x27;t smooth enough around the edges so it scratched the inside of my naval. No biggie though, I was able to work around it. You won&#x27;t find a better value. I definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this starter kit. It was well priced and good quality. I was able to painlessly pierce my nipples. Thank you</li>
            <li> awesome lol my industrial looks great , i recommend being very careful with the needles in you happen to be carless like me . It was a bloody mess haha i jabbed my ears wrong but overall this is a wonderful product for the price</li>
            <li> I placed this ordered on June 8th and paid for expedited shipping, finally received my order on June 23rd, 16 days later.  When I opened my package there were no piercing needles which was basically the main component of this kit, everything else I could have done with out but really... no needles??? I&#x27;m sure everything would have worked fine and the quality of items seems OK but I would not recommend buying from this seller after this, I just feel it was ridiculous to have to wait that long for an incomplete order.</li>
            <li> Very good product didn&#x27;t hurt to pierce it! I recommend it!(:</li>
            <li> This kit was pretty good, it came with everything. The rings were a little too big, but that&#x27;s okay. I have already done 4 piercing with it so far.</li>
            <li> I still have the septum I pierced myself. Never got infected, and the hollow needle went in like a breeze. I still have the captive bead rings, I love them!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s pictured is exactly what I received except for the plugs that you pierce into are cork and not whatever material is shown.  No big deal.</li>
            <li> I love this kit, you get a pair of really good clamps, 2 nice sharp needles, I was able to pierce my own lips with only a slight pinch! Great fast shipping, great product, great seller! (metrotattoo)</li>
            <li> I Loved Piercing My Lip With This . It  Was Sharp &amp; I Almost Didnt Feel  A Thing Until The Skin Part  But It Was A Pinch . I Ordered Somemore Rings Becuz The Ball Was Hard To Put In \\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This kit has everything you need to pierce your body. I used it to pierced my navel and used a smaller needle to pierce my ears and the cork came in handy when piercing my ears. The clamps were good a little rough but they did the job.</li>
            <li> i received damage on mine an wen i e-mailed them almost a month ago they still haven&#x27;t got back to me.</li>
            <li> Everything you need aside from the pliers to spread the jewelry and get it back in shape. Sterile and fun.  These were perfect for piercing my fiance&#x27;s nipples which she loves! ;)</li>
            <li> The Kit came on the earliest set date with all mentioned items. The needle&#x27;s were very very sharp i felt only a little pinch. One problem though, i&#x27;d rather have the ring be a 16 so that way it&#x27;s easier to fit inside the needle and just have it slide through, otherwise it was a very good kit.</li>
            <li> Quite an experience to have my penis pierced by my mistress.</li>
            <li> Came with everything it shows, including metal clamps (unlike some previous reviews). Great quality and no infection. If your worried about infection, be sure to use antibacterial soap and sea salt rinse.</li>
            <li> I was going to pierce my naval then I realized the captive rig wasn&#x27;t wide enough to fit. Received everything in picture. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Came in quickly and nothing was damaged, can&#x27;t wait to get snakebites. It was also good that it came with a good amount of disinfectants, super happy and excited thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Great kit, everything you need, but the earrings are somewhat small, so pierce accordingly! Great tools, perfect needles! Some rubber gloves would make this 100% complete</li>
            <li> Please note that this product does not include gloves. You get everything in the picture: Clamp (in sterile packing), two needles (in sterile packing), two 14 gauge captive bead rings (also in sterile packing), two large alcohol sheets, two packets of lube and two corks for safe piercing. Most professionals agree that gloves are not necessary if you are piercing ONLY yourself. (And if you are not a professional that is the only person you should pierce anyway.)Kudos to metro tattoo for endorsing self piercing AND responsibility!</li>
            <li> I got several infections from this kit, the piercings that come with it are some sort of fake Chinese made metal crap that just should not be put into your body. Everywhere I&#x27;ve put them, from cartilage, to my taint has swollen up and grown inflamed. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Everything was great except for the needles, they were pretty dull. They didn&#x27;t go through well even with the lubricant.</li>
            <li> The needles are nice and sharp and the product comes quickly...but the captive rings they include are just wayyyy too big to fit in the needles, it just doesn&#x27;t work. The clamps are nice and metal though. It&#x27;s a good set for a beginner except for the captive rings.</li>
            <li> ...nothing beats a training piercer!&lt;br /&gt;People may talk trash about the legitimacy of a qualified piercing artist but let me tell you I was a professional tattooist with three shops and I would NEVER try to pierce myself without knowing what I was doing!</li>
