            <li>, I use this eye shadow as a brow powder to fill in any sparse areas, and it looks great</li>
            <li>Great value, but a two of the six eye shadows arrived broke.</li>

            <li>Liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>so blending should have been a top priority for L&#x27;Oreal with this one.</li>
            <li>so glad you offer it..</li>
            <li>A lot more easier to apply than eyeliner and also easy to take off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind this because I appreciate that it washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>It has the perfect color of black for my eyes.</li>
            <li>Ok I ordered this product and it got to me fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>just make sure you get the right color.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and dark, and stays on fairly well.</li>
            <li>Shipped in fine and quickly.</li>
            <li>Great and easy to use and (most importantly) no glitter!</li>
            <li>It is such a good quality product.</li>
            <li>i need more bc of how much i use it</li>
            <li>Shipped quick without any problems</li>
            <li>I love the lush color which I use to outline the outer edges of my eyelid to give it that &amp;#34;cat-like&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>Great for the price and will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly the way it looks in the picture</li>
            <li>I gave 5 stars because it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I love this loreal lush raven eye shadow, when I am going for a more sultry smokey look, I put this color in my outer crease, sometimes I line my eyelash line with this, Oh and my favorite secret with this eye shadow is: I use it as a brow powder,</li>
            <li>The color is much darker than it looks here.</li>
            <li>I really wanted gray.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth, long lasting and full coverage!</li>
            <li>the shadow arrived in a huge box w/ other products that were also shipped to me.</li>
            <li>It was true to color but due to the non blending and a bit streaky formula</li>
            <li>it was clear it had been bouncing around in the box unprotected.</li>
            <li>its such a nice dark black and it lasts when i wear it out.</li>
            <li>came fast and was as expected</li>
            <li>So good, that to remove was genuinely a little difficult.</li>

            <li> Really looks black!</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed about this particular shadow is it was not easy to blend which tended to be streaky even after labor of putting it on.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented dark black eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as an eyeliner (applied with a wet angle brush) for years.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what color i was recieveing so confused</li>
            <li> I ordered this with other make up products</li>
            <li> putting brown or grayish black eye brow powder over them is dumb and does not look natural, so</li>
            <li> This is a very black matte eyeshadow as expected.</li>
            <li> It looks black.</li>
            <li> all my girls who have black eye brows</li>
            <li> or hey you want black eyebrows</li>
            <li> so you have to put a couple of layers for it to show coal black</li>
            <li> it was midnight black</li>
            <li> Its dark, very dark so putting it on correctly is a must</li>
            <li> the outside of the plastic container was all scratched up and there was a small piece of tape sealing the cover closed which was broken.</li>
            <li> what about us girls who HAVE Black Eyebrows!</li>
            <li> YUP it&#x27;s a all in one eye shadow, I have dark black hair, and I am sorry I am tired of these makeup companies only going to a dark brown or a grayish black eye brow powder.</li>
            <li> And I am so sick of all those people saying black brows don&#x27;t look natural!</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> it just so confusing</li>
            <li> what a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I hate the waiting</li>
            <li> and you look like an idiot clown</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The color is much darker than it looks here. It looks black. I wanted a gray shadow.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeshadow for years to cover bald spots left from cancer (thankfully recovered) and menopause.  I rub it on my scalp in the bald places after washing my hair.  Works great!</li>
            <li> AWESOME. It is such a good quality product. So good, that to remove was genuinely a little difficult. Liked it a lot. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly. I love the lush color which I use to outline the outer edges of my eyelid to give it that &amp;#34;cat-like&amp;#34; look. Great and easy to use and (most importantly) no glitter!</li>
            <li> It is so smooth, long lasting and full coverage! Great product! Good size as well! I&#x27;m make up artist, and I recommend it!</li>
            <li> the shadow arrived in a huge box w/ other products that were also shipped to me. there was no packaging around the shadow and it was reduced to bits and crumbled pieced when it arrived. it was clear it had been bouncing around in the box unprotected. the outside of the plastic container was all scratched up and there was a small piece of tape sealing the cover closed which was broken. it came with no shadow applicator as seen on the photo. what a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as an eyeliner (applied with a wet angle brush) for years. It goes on nice and dark, and stays on fairly well. If I&#x27;m going out at the end of the day I might reapply it. I don&#x27;t mind this because I appreciate that it washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> came fast and was as expected</li>
            <li> Very pigmented dark black eye shadow. I use this as a substitute for eyeliner. A lot more easier to apply than eyeliner and also easy to take off. Great for the price and will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> its such a nice dark black and it lasts when i wear it out. love it. i need more bc of how much i use it</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve ordered this and plan on ordering it again!!  I should&#x27;ve ordered more!</li>
            <li> Really looks black! I really wanted gray.</li>
            <li> This product worked wonders for my eyes! It has the perfect color of black for my eyes. It didn&#x27;t cause any break outs and didn&#x27;t crumble.</li>
            <li> Ok I ordered this product and it got to me fairly quickly. I like that. I hate the waiting lol. The product is exactly the way it looks in the picture and I was very pleased. The only thing I noticed about this particular shadow is it was not easy to blend which tended to be streaky even after labor of putting it on. Its dark, very dark so putting it on correctly is a must or it shows every mistake and you look like an idiot clown so blending should have been a top priority for L&#x27;Oreal with this one. But hey! What do I know I&#x27;m only a consumer I don&#x27;t work there. It was true to color but due to the non blending and a bit streaky formula it only got three stars from me.</li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars because it is exactly what I wanted.  The color is gorgeous.  Shipped quick without any problems</li>
            <li> I love this loreal lush raven eye shadow, when I am going for a more sultry smokey look, I put this color in my outer crease, sometimes I line my eyelash line with this, Oh and my favorite secret with this eye shadow is: I use it as a brow powder, YUP it&#x27;s a all in one eye shadow, I have dark black hair, and I am sorry I am tired of these makeup companies only going to a dark brown or a grayish black eye brow powder. And I am so sick of all those people saying black brows don&#x27;t look natural! Hello? what about us girls who HAVE Black Eyebrows! putting brown or grayish black eye brow powder over them is dumb and does not look natural, so all my girls who have black eye brows or hey you want black eyebrows, I use this eye shadow as a brow powder to fill in any sparse areas, and it looks great it&#x27;s not shimmery and it lasts and holds us amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a very black matte eyeshadow as expected. Shipped in fine and quickly. Reason for giving it a 4 is because it is not as pigmented as it could be so you have to put a couple of layers for it to show coal black</li>
            <li> I ordered this with other make up products but it never showed up til this it has been quite a while, I wrote something to amazon but never got response.. guess i&#x27;ll never know how this product is.. wont attempt to buy this on here again.</li>
            <li> Great value, but a two of the six eye shadows arrived broke. They replaced only one. I don&#x27;t think I would order shadows thru the mail again.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what color i was recieveing so confused i thought that i was getting a purple color it was midnight black it just so confusing just make sure you get the right color.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Hard to find so glad you offer it..</li>
