    <ol>
            <li> I love clear bags for my stuff. The bag is smaller than I expected though.</li>
            <li> I bought for my wife but I think she was looking for something bigger to use it only in home, thought this one good size for traveling.</li>
            <li> Received this in the mail yesterday, and the zipper broke all the way around this case. Very cheaply made. I threw it away, wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back giving that I only pay a few bucks for it.</li>
            <li> Save your money. Flimsy junk was right. Had to use clear packing tape to repair on the FIRST day. it wasn&#x27;t worth the time that it would take to pack it up and send it back.</li>
            <li> Thinner than I expected, but perfect. The seems don&#x27;t leak liqui and size wise it could probably fit two tissue boxes inside (just for a comparison)</li>
            <li> This is poorly constructed, and not at all durable. zippers are difficult to use. would love to return this product- contacted seller but still no reply. wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Pictures can be deceiving.  This was one of my worst purchases.  The quality is $ store, at best. Too costly to return, so I will \\&quot;eat\\&quot; this one.  BUYER BEWARE</li>
            <li> I used this bag for my spices.  The zipper broke after 3 months of use.  As another reviewer wrote...bag is a bit flimsy.  To be honest, I&#x27;m not surprised that the zipper broke after 3 months of use.  I could not find these clear cheap bags locally so I turned to Amazon.  I would not recommend this bag for daily use.  Note:  I did not use this bag daily which makes it even sadder because it broke after only 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> this item didn&#x27;t cost much,  so I did get what I paid for. A little smaller than I wanted,  but I didn&#x27;t look closely at the dimensions advertised. my fault. not bad quality,  the black trim reinforces the bag well..so no ripping yet.</li>
            <li> This tote was exactly what I expected. It will be great for storing toys. It&#x27;s not big, so the little pieces won&#x27;t get lost.</li>
            <li> Came in an envelope. Flattened, squashed and zipper pull broken off. Really wanted this tote to work so I smoothed it out and stuffed with tissue to restore shape. Put pull back on and closed it so it would work. Then attempted to zip and the zipper was not fully on track and of course didnt work. Have tried a dozen ways to get zipper to hold and work. Will not  go around edges of tote  without  coming  off track. Am frustrated, irritated, and am going to throw it in the garbage. I will then have to purchase a replacement as clear plastic is required on my job and I cannot use a ziploc bag indefinitely. I am accustomed to so much better from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This  is a nice bag for a workplace that requires clear bags.  It&#x27;s big and sturdy enough to keep a few essentials.  It is worth the low price!</li>
            <li> This clear tote is very thin.  If it&#x27;s empty it will lay flat, and not stand on it&#x27;s own.  That could be a good thing, if you need to store it away.  It won&#x27;t take up any additional space, just fold it up.</li>
            <li> Very low quality material.  Not up to Amazon standards.  Zipper defective upon delivery.</li>
            <li> Love it! exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Good bag, I did return because I had ordered several others in different sizes.</li>
            <li> I love this bag for my makeup!! Great bag, pretty fast shipping! It&#x27;s a good handy bag to put your makeup in if you carry a big purse (like I do haha)  :)</li>
            <li> Plastic tore at zipper on first out but is a great size and bargain at the price.</li>
            <li> Zipper broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This is holding up well with daily usage. I have been looking for something like this for years and finally found something strong enough to hold what I need.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 6yr old as a lunch bag. At the daycare she attends all food items have to be in clear freezer bags. So insetad of wasting a freezer bag every day i got this and it works well. I thought it would rip after being reused so often, but its still hanging in there after about (6) months.</li>
