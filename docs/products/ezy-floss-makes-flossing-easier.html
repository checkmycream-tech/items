    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product is excellent.</li>
            <li>However, it is still excellent for cleaning in-between the teeth - just not sides of teeth.</li>
            <li>These were wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>This one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>These are the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are really great though!</li>
            <li>Happy Happy Happy</li>
            <li>though, great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is perfect in many ways.</li>
            <li>This works great for one-handed flossing, I think I might like it better than sticking my fingers in my mouth while two-handed flossing!</li>
            <li>Good for us environmentalists.  </li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>I ordered this item along with the \\&quot;Flossaid\\&quot;, and this one is much better!    </li>
            <li>Love that it is Made in USA!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t use the floss it comes with!</li>
            <li>I bought this already knowing that this flosser is absolutely the best and sturdiest out there!</li>
            <li>I went looking for something I could wrap with my own skinny/sturdy</li>
            <li>It makes flossing very easy.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and you don&#x27;t end up strangulating your fingers by winding floss around them.  </li>
            <li>Yet not quite as good as the original - Butler.</li>
            <li>A great invention (and so much easier than flossing kids without a handle!)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love one hand operation.</li>
            <li>** by Flossaid is BETTER than this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a floss holder for quite some time, and I&#x27;m glad I found this one.</li>
            <li>I gather it is made for immediate use rather than trying to convert you from your favorite brand of floss.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because I love the disposable flossers</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, it uses much more floss than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I USED THIS FOR MANY YRS(7</li>
            <li>OR 8)</li>
            <li>I set out to find a more permanent solution to my problem.</li>
            <li>I can see one possible improvement to make the Ezy Floss perfect.</li>
            <li>I gave it five stars anyway, because, as far as I can see, it&#x27;s the best thing available.</li>
            <li>The floss stays on and the angle is way better than the disposable floss sticks.</li>
            <li>Now I floss much more often.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Made in China disposable kids floss.</li>
            <li>This product is great and sturdy, I don&#x27;t think it uses that much floss compared with flossing by hand.</li>
            <li>so I found these for him and he was pleased.</li>
            <li>Butler flossmate is much better.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
            <li>and I now get rave reviews after every check up!&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have bought many-many more for kids, grandkids and friends - they all thank me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for children who can&#x27;t use floss alone very effectively or for children who you are helping to floss.</li>
            <li>Easy, cheap way to floss!</li>
            <li>I suggest you buy the original ones and you will be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>so in love with the first one, I just ordered two more - one for my travel bag and another to have as a spare just in case. :)</li>
            <li>Easy to use but a bit cumbersome</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to hold .</li>
            <li>Easy threading</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, quality, doesn&#x27;t flex.  </li>
            <li>Much more economical than the disposable floss picks.</li>
            <li>These are fabulous for my kids.</li>
            <li>Worth much more.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not a fan of flossing this product does make it significantly easier if you know how to use it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes time to wind the floss around the contraption, but not that much more than finger-winding really.  </li>
            <li>Makes flossing kids&#x27; teeth so much easier, and I love that I don&#x27;t have to toss it after one use.</li>
            <li>More importantly, the prongs are robust (about 1/4\\&quot; thick), and they remain fairly rigid, so it&#x27;s easy to maintain control of the floss.</li>
            <li>bending &amp; deforming quickly - requiring you to soon repurchase a stiffer/newer</li>
            <li>I luckily discovered Flossaid 20 years ago</li>
            <li>This little doohickey is great for flossing betwixt your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I looked in about a million different grocery stores and drug stores for a floss handle, and I even tried to make my own.</li>
            <li>And accordingly, I rarely flossed.</li>
            <li>It would be nice, however, if it was bent to make getting between those back teeth easier.</li>
            <li>I found the old fashioned way of holding floss with my hands/fingers better than using this.  </li>
            <li>And my young daughter wasn&#x27;t very excited either.</li>
            <li>Has arthroscopic surgery to repair my torn labrum in my right shoulder.</li>
            <li>Easy to load (although you don&#x27;t need nearly as much floss as the instructions tell you) and keeps the tension really well.</li>
            <li>This is a great flosser for small mouths.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old can use this easily.  </li>
            <li>He was so excited to see his new Ezy Floss.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is about 3 inches long, and made of sturdy plastic, kind of like toothbrush handle material.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use several yards, but most of that is storage.  </li>
            <li>First, the \\&quot;arms\\&quot; are not at a very usable angle (not like the disposable design).</li>
            <li>Also, this product, for it&#x27;s small size, does not cover around gum as good as Flossaid.  </li>
            <li>My dentist also noticed an improvement in my teeth, particularly because now I&#x27;m actually flossing more than once</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to floss regularly.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, this is a huge improvement over finger-flossing for me.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my dad, he has been using this product for many many years and has spent the last twelve years looking for one to replace his old one</li>
            <li>Ezy Floss is VERY RIGID and it seems durable.</li>
            <li>Very well designed product.</li>
            <li>Yes, I have to stick the whole thing in my mouth, but I do that with fingers too.  </li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still much easier than doing it by hand, however.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really worried about it, though, you can always advance it by a shorter distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find this tool helps make flossing much easier versus just using my fingers.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have to put the whole thing in my mouth, which means my whole hand is in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not make it much easier to floss.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like anyone and don&#x27;t really like taking the time to floss anyways, this thing is not going to help you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good concept, but the stubby floss fingers weren&#x27;t wide enough for my man&#x27;s mouth</li>
            <li>The are slightly less convienient than the disposables, but they are not difficult to restring and you can use your favorite floss.      </li>
            <li>Most other flossers I tried</li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve found is that most floss commonly available in grocery stores is thin and waxy, so it easily slips out of the grips of the Ezy Floss.</li>
            <li>This flosser is easy to use once you figure out how to weave the floss just right to make it tight.  </li>
            <li>Flossaid is stronger, wider, more rigid (the Butler flosser bends/warps quickly &amp; does not allow enough room to move the floss up &amp; down below my gum</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to get harder places.  </li>
            <li>The key is to follow the directions that come with this  product to make sure there is enough tension.</li>
            <li>The floss can become loose unless you secure it well-</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.    </li>
            <li>The Ezy Floss works far better than other flossers I have tried.</li>
            <li>This little goodie has been around for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to normal flossers and floss</li>
            <li>This not a negative review, call it constrictive criticism.</li>
            <li>device EASILY reached waaay back to my crooked morals and roots.</li>
            <li>The only gripe I would have is the \\&quot;loading\\&quot; of the floss onto the device, not complicated but a little more involved than I would like.</li>
            <li>The Ezy Floss is not what I expected compared to the original one.</li>
            <li>They are shorter than the original and harder to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as easy to use as a disposable, but it&#x27;s certainly less wasteful.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its cute and saves you stress getting the back teeth.</li>
            <li>This holder is long enough to easily floss completely in a minute or two.  </li>
            <li>There is so much more control than hand flossing and overall much less than buying disposable plastic all the time.  </li>
            <li>I practically have to break the top half of my head off to properly floss my teeth.</li>
            <li>me, I&#x27;ll stick to the old fashioned method after all.</li>
            <li>Remember those old Reach commercials, where the cartoon guy has a flip-top head?</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s still kinda young</li>
            <li>but I wanted to get her used to flossing at an early age.</li>
            <li>The head of the device should be bent at a 90 degree angle to make this possible, but this device just sticks straight out.</li>
            <li>did downgrade one star as it doesn&#x27;t have a way to cut old floss off.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ve been looking for more of these for other family members!  </li>
            <li>Some of my teeth are tightly space and this one is sturdy enough and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>I finally found a decent selection online and settled on the Ezy Floss.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I have become a Flossaid loyalist &amp; highly recommend this American brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it really makes a spool of floss go a long way.</li>
            <li>The new one is bulky and not flexible for reaching way back.  </li>
            <li>Small enough to easily get to the very back of your mouth around your molars, but large enough to be controlled easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>once you get used up it, and fresh floss every time without all the plastic waste.</li>
            <li>piece of garbage string is so thick and cheap.</li>
            <li>The flosser is made of thick, solid plastic, unlike the easily breakable disposables.  </li>
            <li>Second, the item is very small which means that most of it needs to go into your mouth to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready for next time without any loose floss dangling.</li>
            <li>Very difficult to re-thread, despite instructions being excellent, it&#x27;s also rather short, and hard to reach into the far back nooks and cranies of our mouths.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good concept, but the stubby floss fingers weren&#x27;t wide enough for my man&#x27;s mouth</li>
            <li> The are slightly less convienient than the disposables, but they are not difficult to restring and you can use your favorite floss.      </li>
            <li> Most other flossers I tried</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve found is that most floss commonly available in grocery stores is thin and waxy, so it easily slips out of the grips of the Ezy Floss.</li>
            <li> This flosser is easy to use once you figure out how to weave the floss just right to make it tight.  </li>
            <li> Flossaid is stronger, wider, more rigid (the Butler flosser bends/warps quickly &amp; does not allow enough room to move the floss up &amp; down below my gum</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to get harder places.  </li>
            <li> The key is to follow the directions that come with this  product to make sure there is enough tension.</li>
            <li> The floss can become loose unless you secure it well-</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.    </li>
            <li> The Ezy Floss works far better than other flossers I have tried.</li>
            <li> This little goodie has been around for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to normal flossers and floss</li>
            <li> This not a negative review, call it constrictive criticism.</li>
            <li> device EASILY reached waaay back to my crooked morals and roots.</li>
            <li> The only gripe I would have is the \\&quot;loading\\&quot; of the floss onto the device, not complicated but a little more involved than I would like.</li>
            <li> The Ezy Floss is not what I expected compared to the original one.</li>
            <li> They are shorter than the original and harder to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as easy to use as a disposable, but it&#x27;s certainly less wasteful.</li>
            <li> Other than that, its cute and saves you stress getting the back teeth.</li>
            <li> This holder is long enough to easily floss completely in a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> There is so much more control than hand flossing and overall much less than buying disposable plastic all the time.  </li>
            <li> I practically have to break the top half of my head off to properly floss my teeth.</li>
            <li> me, I&#x27;ll stick to the old fashioned method after all.</li>
            <li> Remember those old Reach commercials, where the cartoon guy has a flip-top head?</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s still kinda young</li>
            <li> but I wanted to get her used to flossing at an early age.</li>
            <li> The head of the device should be bent at a 90 degree angle to make this possible, but this device just sticks straight out.</li>
            <li> did downgrade one star as it doesn&#x27;t have a way to cut old floss off.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ve been looking for more of these for other family members!  </li>
            <li> Some of my teeth are tightly space and this one is sturdy enough and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> I finally found a decent selection online and settled on the Ezy Floss.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I have become a Flossaid loyalist &amp; highly recommend this American brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it really makes a spool of floss go a long way.</li>
            <li> The new one is bulky and not flexible for reaching way back.  </li>
            <li> Small enough to easily get to the very back of your mouth around your molars, but large enough to be controlled easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> once you get used up it, and fresh floss every time without all the plastic waste.</li>
            <li> piece of garbage string is so thick and cheap.</li>
            <li> The flosser is made of thick, solid plastic, unlike the easily breakable disposables.  </li>
            <li> Second, the item is very small which means that most of it needs to go into your mouth to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready for next time without any loose floss dangling.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to re-thread, despite instructions being excellent, it&#x27;s also rather short, and hard to reach into the far back nooks and cranies of our mouths.</li>
            <li> I was pretty amazed that no physical stores seemed to carry anything like that, but I guess the idea of reusable flossers is contrary to the common mentality.</li>
            <li> Also, I liked the idea of using floss tape or specialty floss rather than the weird plastic \\&quot;string\\&quot; that typically comes on disposable flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained that it is too small, but it easily reaches all the way back to my wisdom teeth.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, because it is straight, it is more difficult to maneuver the floss between those back teeth than with the disposables, which are usually angled.  </li>
            <li> For reference, this flosser is 3.25&amp;#34; long and 1&amp;#34; at its widest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> and he didn&#x27;t like the long strings</li>
            <li> It is easier for me to hold than other flossers I&#x27;ve used in the past and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I was tired of the cost and waste associated with disposable flossers that mostly just ripped apart between my tight teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too small for adult mouth</li>
            <li> The only down side is you have to wash it off every once in a while because it can get stinky after a while.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to reach into the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> were *too* flexible, so the floss didn&#x27;t have enough tension to stay on the thing while I worked it around my tightly packed molars.  </li>
            <li> (the rest is still wasted because it still goes in your mouth but doesn&#x27;t actually touch your teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other floss handles of all sorts, but they never keep the floss tight, and are too big for my small/narrow jaw structure (over 30 but still have to use kiddie toothbrushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It would be my hunch that the other floss holders manufacturers of today were inspired by this product.      </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other holders out there -</li>
            <li> I received it and like my other one it works well</li>
            <li> I wanted this tool to help me floss my molars, and I should have paid attention to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just the floss that comes with the holder but didn&#x27;t want to spend the time to restring with other floss.</li>
            <li> tried every other brand</li>
            <li> HARD TIME GETTING TO BACK TEETH BECAUSE HANDLE IS TOO</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not useful.</li>
            <li> This thing is no fun.</li>
            <li> It does not feel like it would break or wear down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very uncomfortable to put into your mouth to reach your back teeth, especially if you have big hands.</li>
            <li> Even figuring out how to thread the floss up, around, down through was a ridiculous amount of work, much less moving the floss enough to use it.</li>
            <li> It saves on dental floss because you use a lot less</li>
            <li> Not true of this holder, don&#x27;t know about the others.  </li>
            <li> My dentist told me holders pull the floss so tight that it doesn&#x27;t get around each tooth.  </li>
            <li> It takes at least as much as I usually use to floss when I use my fingers, but only \\&quot;use\\&quot; about 2\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Even at that rate, it&#x27;s still less waste than all the plastic from the disposables and far less expensive too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the disposables for years, until it dawned on me that all those little pieces of plastic I was throwing away would be kicking around the planet basically forever.</li>
            <li> This is totally different from the Flossaid, which is way too flexible, and ends up being too awkward to use regularly.    </li>
            <li> AFTER GETTING OUT, ALAS IT FINALLY SHEARED ONE OF THE SIDES KNOB OFF.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the disposable flossers from some time, but decided to give this a try to save money and reduce waste.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the Reach Flossers for a few years, but the disposable heads run $5 a month.</li>
            <li> Had difficulty getting the floss down between my teeth, it would catch then snap down hard</li>
            <li> We use this to floss our 3-year old&#x27;s teeth, since his mouth is so small that it&#x27;s difficult to get in there using your fingers and floss.</li>
            <li> only real complaint --</li>
            <li> Not to mention it is difficult to get to the back teeth.      </li>
            <li> It had a small learning curve with angles as its a bit wide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, dental floss is too hard to hold around my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Wow, is it ever bad.  </li>
            <li> Some people have complained about the amount of floss it uses.  </li>
            <li> No good - too small to hold.</li>
            <li> I used others in the mean time which were flimsy by comparison.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the single-use floss sticks by other brands to floss my kids but started feeling guilty about all the plastc I was putting in the landfill.</li>
            <li> which was a bit hard on my poor gums.  </li>
            <li> Poor fiber quality in disposable floss did not do the job for me.</li>
            <li> I am unable to lift my arm for 3-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too complicated with the winding of the floss and threading.</li>
            <li> It would have been difficult to find an uglier color.  </li>
            <li> but I felt bad about using them once and throwing them away.</li>
            <li> (I was born with bad teeth)&lt;br</li>
            <li> that color is UGLY.  </li>
            <li> item is durable and does not flex like others I have read about, but is very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I would leave the bathroom bloody mouthed and with sore lipped.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing without a holder of some sort.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this product for my dad, he has been using this product for many many years and has spent the last twelve years looking for one to replace his old one and I finally found it for him.  He was so excited to see his new Ezy Floss.</li>
            <li> This flosser is easy to use once you figure out how to weave the floss just right to make it tight.  It saves on dental floss because you use a lot less and if you use the disposable plastic ones, you save a lot of plastic.  Good for us environmentalists.  I don&#x27;t know why everyone doesn&#x27;t use this.  It makes it easy to get harder places.  The only down side is you have to wash it off every once in a while because it can get stinky after a while.  Other than that, its cute and saves you stress getting the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I got this flosser for my son, and he uses it every night and no longer complains about flossing his teeth! I just love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually used the same floss handle since I could remember, maybe 1980, but a recent hospital visit lost some of my things.  I thought I&#x27;d never find this tool again.  Thankfully, I was amazed to find these online.  There is so much more control than hand flossing and overall much less than buying disposable plastic all the time.  And it really makes a spool of floss go a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I absolutely love one hand operation. Poor fiber quality in disposable floss did not do the job for me. However, in Ezy Floss, I can load any quality floss string I want. It makes flossing very easy. You can actually use every inch of floss string. Saving plastic at both ends. Ezy Floss is VERY RIGID and it seems durable. Very well designed product. Highly recommended.    EDIT (after a 1 yr of use): Flossaid Dental Floss Holder **ONE** by Flossaid is BETTER than this product. This product is too rigid to do the job as well as a flexible Flossaid Dental Floss Holder by Flossaid.  Also, this product, for it&#x27;s small size, does not cover around gum as good as Flossaid.  However, it is still excellent for cleaning in-between the teeth - just not sides of teeth.</li>
            <li> After reading the amazon reviews, I purchased two of these flossers for my children.  I was tired of wasteful disposable flossers and wanted to find something that would fit in their mouths and allow them to floss themselves well.    These were wonderful.  The are slightly less convienient than the disposables, but they are not difficult to restring and you can use your favorite floss.      I highly recommend them for children who can&#x27;t use floss alone very effectively or for children who you are helping to floss.</li>
            <li> Too small for adult mouth</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS UNSATISFACTORY. I HARD TIME GETTING TO BACK TEETH BECAUSE HANDLE IS TOO SHORT.ALSO IT BROKE 2 MONTHS LATER</li>
            <li> Has arthroscopic surgery to repair my torn labrum in my right shoulder. I am unable to lift my arm for 3-6 weeks. This works great for one-handed flossing, I think I might like it better than sticking my fingers in my mouth while two-handed flossing! Works with waxed floss. Much more economical than the disposable floss picks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item along with the \\&quot;Flossaid\\&quot;, and this one is much better!    The whole thing is about 3 inches long, and made of sturdy plastic, kind of like toothbrush handle material. More importantly, the prongs are robust (about 1/4\\&quot; thick), and they remain fairly rigid, so it&#x27;s easy to maintain control of the floss. The knobs for winding floss are well designed, and it comes with a helpful instruction sheet, so you know you&#x27;re using it as intended. This is totally different from the Flossaid, which is way too flexible, and ends up being too awkward to use regularly.    This Ezy Floss is the way to go. It&#x27;s not as easy to use as a disposable, but it&#x27;s certainly less wasteful. I&#x27;d been looking for a floss holder for quite some time, and I&#x27;m glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great flosser for small mouths. It is easier for me to hold than other flossers I&#x27;ve used in the past and is very sturdy. Oh, and the dental floss that is included lives up to it&#x27;s reputation. I gather it is made for immediate use rather than trying to convert you from your favorite brand of floss.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a flossing tool, thought I would try this one but it&#x27;s really not useful. It&#x27;s way too complicated with the winding of the floss and threading. If the floss breaks it&#x27;s quite the process to get it re-threaded. Also it&#x27;s too short to reach back teeth.</li>
            <li> The Ezy Floss is not what I expected compared to the original one. The new one is bulky and not flexible for reaching way back.  It has a short reach and the prongs are not flexible which doesn&#x27;t allow tension on the floss.  They are shorter than the original and harder to use.  I suggest you buy the original ones and you will be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I love the disposable flossers but I felt bad about using them once and throwing them away. Also, I liked the idea of using floss tape or specialty floss rather than the weird plastic \\&quot;string\\&quot; that typically comes on disposable flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is durable and does not flex like others I have read about, but is very awkward to use. First, the \\&quot;arms\\&quot; are not at a very usable angle (not like the disposable design). Second, the item is very small which means that most of it needs to go into your mouth to reach the back teeth. If the intent is to keep your fingers out of your mouth, this item isn&#x27;t going to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it uses much more floss than I anticipated. It takes at least as much as I usually use to floss when I use my fingers, but only \\&quot;use\\&quot; about 2\\&quot; (the rest is still wasted because it still goes in your mouth but doesn&#x27;t actually touch your teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I&#x27;ll stick to the old fashioned method after all.</li>
            <li> I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS MODEL APROX. 3O YRS AGO WHILE SERVING IN THE US NAVY. I USED THIS FOR MANY YRS(7 OR 8) AFTER GETTING OUT, ALAS IT FINALLY SHEARED ONE OF THE SIDES KNOB OFF. I TRYED AND TRYED TO FIND A REPLACEMENT TO NO AVAIL. I TRIED OTHERS BUT NONE WERE ITS MATCH. NOW AFTER @ 22 YRS I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!!!!!! THIS MAKES MY DAY</li>
            <li> This little doohickey is great for flossing betwixt your teeth.  It is very easy to use and you don&#x27;t end up strangulating your fingers by winding floss around them.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> We use this to floss our 3-year old&#x27;s teeth, since his mouth is so small that it&#x27;s difficult to get in there using your fingers and floss.</li>
            <li> I had a flosser like this about 10 years ago and broke it.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement every since.  Most other flossers I tried were *too* flexible, so the floss didn&#x27;t have enough tension to stay on the thing while I worked it around my tightly packed molars.  This one is perfect.  Yes, I have to stick the whole thing in my mouth, but I do that with fingers too.  Yes, it takes time to wind the floss around the contraption, but not that much more than finger-winding really.  Yes, all of the floss ends up in your mouth, but it does with fingers too.  Ultimately, this is a huge improvement over finger-flossing for me.  My dentist also noticed an improvement in my teeth, particularly because now I&#x27;m actually flossing more than once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint -- that color is UGLY.  Wow, is it ever bad.  It would have been difficult to find an uglier color.  Other than that though, great product.</li>
            <li> I practically have to break the top half of my head off to properly floss my teeth. Remember those old Reach commercials, where the cartoon guy has a flip-top head? Yeah, that&#x27;s what I need to use dental floss without some sort of aid. I&#x27;d been using the disposables for years, until it dawned on me that all those little pieces of plastic I was throwing away would be kicking around the planet basically forever. I set out to find a more permanent solution to my problem. I looked in about a million different grocery stores and drug stores for a floss handle, and I even tried to make my own. I was pretty amazed that no physical stores seemed to carry anything like that, but I guess the idea of reusable flossers is contrary to the common mentality. I finally found a decent selection online and settled on the Ezy Floss.     In short, it&#x27;s fantastic. It does exactly what I need it to. The only problem I&#x27;ve found is that most floss commonly available in grocery stores is thin and waxy, so it easily slips out of the grips of the Ezy Floss. I can see one possible improvement to make the Ezy Floss perfect. I would like it if it had some sort of clamp that you could close over the floss to hold it in place, rather than relying on intricate wrapping techniques. I gave it five stars anyway, because, as far as I can see, it&#x27;s the best thing available.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous for my kids. The floss stays on and the angle is way better than the disposable floss sticks.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing kids&#x27; teeth so much easier, and I love that I don&#x27;t have to toss it after one use. Great product!</li>
            <li> Easy to use but a bit cumbersome</li>
            <li> My hand to mouth ratio is proportionately in favor of my hands. That is, I have a big mouth and even bigger hands, Prior to the purchasing of this device I would leave the bathroom bloody mouthed and with sore lipped. And accordingly, I rarely flossed. Now I floss much more often. No longer do I leave the bathroom feeling beat up and bloodied.</li>
            <li> This little goodie has been around for more than 30 years.  And that&#x27;s how long I&#x27;ve been looking for more of these for other family members!  It would be my hunch that the other floss holders manufacturers of today were inspired by this product.      For me, dental floss is too hard to hold around my fingers.  They get red - it hurts.  Either that or the floss slips through my fingers.  Not to mention it is difficult to get to the back teeth.      This holder is long enough to easily floss completely in a minute or two.  My dentist told me holders pull the floss so tight that it doesn&#x27;t get around each tooth.  Not true of this holder, don&#x27;t know about the others.  I haven&#x27;t tried the other holders out there - I only know that this one works!  You can use any floss you like!      Bottom line:  Easy, cheap way to floss!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the disposable flossers from some time, but decided to give this a try to save money and reduce waste.  After using it for a short while, here are some of my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Some reviewers have complained that it is too small, but it easily reaches all the way back to my wisdom teeth.  The size of your mouth could be a factor, though.  For reference, this flosser is 3.25&amp;#34; long and 1&amp;#34; at its widest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  On the other hand, because it is straight, it is more difficult to maneuver the floss between those back teeth than with the disposables, which are usually angled.  It&#x27;s still much easier than doing it by hand, however.  Teeth closer to the front are not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The flosser is made of thick, solid plastic, unlike the easily breakable disposables.  Unless it is abused, I doubt this thing will ever break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Some people have complained about the amount of floss it uses.  The instructions say to use several yards, but most of that is storage.  They recommend advancing the floss 12 inches at a time when it breaks.  Even at that rate, it&#x27;s still less waste than all the plastic from the disposables and far less expensive too.  If you&#x27;re really worried about it, though, you can always advance it by a shorter distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  It would be nice, however, if it was bent to make getting between those back teeth easier.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old can use this easily.  Love that it is Made in USA!  Much better than the Made in China disposable kids floss.</li>
            <li> I find this tool helps make flossing much easier versus just using my fingers.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for years now.  I also like that it reduces the amount of floss needed.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to re-thread, despite instructions being excellent, it&#x27;s also rather short, and hard to reach into the far back nooks and cranies of our mouths.</li>
            <li> Great product! does work, i prefer it over the traditional way definitely. Although I&#x27;m not a fan of flossing this product does make it significantly easier if you know how to use it. Each person may have a different experience though, read the directions and you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems. Recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this already knowing that this flosser is absolutely the best and sturdiest out there! I had another one just like it for 29yrs and lost it. I used others in the mean time which were flimsy by comparison. I just thought one day maybe it&#x27;s on Amazon. Happy Happy Happy I was when I saw it on amazon . Zip zap I received it and like my other one it works well, it&#x27;s easy to hold . Some of my teeth are tightly space and this one is sturdy enough and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something like this to floss my daughter&#x27;s teeth. She&#x27;s still kinda young but I wanted to get her used to flossing at an early age. This product is great and sturdy, I don&#x27;t think it uses that much floss compared with flossing by hand. The key is to follow the directions that come with this  product to make sure there is enough tension. Once I&#x27;m done flossing my daughter&#x27;s teeth, I snip the used floss off at the closest winding point with a pair of kitchen scissors and it&#x27;s ready for next time without any loose floss dangling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very uncomfortable to put into your mouth to reach your back teeth, especially if you have big hands. I feel like I have to put the whole thing in my mouth, which means my whole hand is in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to normal flossers and floss</li>
            <li> Not what I was hoping for but it will work in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the single-use floss sticks by other brands to floss my kids but started feeling guilty about all the plastc I was putting in the landfill. These are the best. Easy threading once you get used up it, and fresh floss every time without all the plastic waste. A great invention (and so much easier than flossing kids without a handle!)</li>
            <li> It does the job. Make sure you don&#x27;t use the floss it comes with! Buy another floss string, the one it comes with is like kite string! piece of garbage string is so thick and cheap.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these religiously,  The dentist said to floss and he didn&#x27;t like the long strings so I found these for him and he was pleased.</li>
            <li> No good - too small to hold. Butler flossmate is much better.</li>
            <li> The flosser does make it easier to reach all the areas needed for a proper flossing. The only gripe I would have is the \\&quot;loading\\&quot; of the floss onto the device, not complicated but a little more involved than I would like. This not a negative review, call it constrictive criticism.</li>
            <li> Default string sucked</li>
            <li> I had been using the Reach Flossers for a few years, but the disposable heads run $5 a month. Over time, that adds up! I have tried other floss handles of all sorts, but they never keep the floss tight, and are too big for my small/narrow jaw structure (over 30 but still have to use kiddie toothbrushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are really great though! Easy to load (although you don&#x27;t need nearly as much floss as the instructions tell you) and keeps the tension really well. Small enough to easily get to the very back of your mouth around your molars, but large enough to be controlled easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am so in love with the first one, I just ordered two more - one for my travel bag and another to have as a spare just in case. :)</li>
            <li> I wanted this tool to help me floss my molars, and I should have paid attention to the other reviews. The head of the device should be bent at a 90 degree angle to make this possible, but this device just sticks straight out.</li>
            <li> I found the old fashioned way of holding floss with my hands/fingers better than using this.  Had difficulty getting the floss down between my teeth, it would catch then snap down hard which was a bit hard on my poor gums.  Maybe it&#x27;s just the floss that comes with the holder but didn&#x27;t want to spend the time to restring with other floss.</li>
            <li> The Ezy Floss works far better than other flossers I have tried. It is small enough to reach into the back of my mouth.  The floss can become loose unless you secure it well-I leave the last inch tucked up under my thumb to keep it taut while flossing. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be like. Does not make it much easier to floss. And my young daughter wasn&#x27;t very excited either.</li>
            <li> Even figuring out how to thread the floss up, around, down through was a ridiculous amount of work, much less moving the floss enough to use it.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to floss regularly. Worth much more. Yet not quite as good as the original - Butler. Buy both and try both. they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
            <li> I tried three of these with my family . . . It&#x27;s a good concept, but the stubby floss fingers weren&#x27;t wide enough for my man&#x27;s mouth (maybe kids??)  .  .  .  I also found the plastic was way too flexible: bending &amp; deforming quickly - requiring you to soon repurchase a stiffer/newer replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have become a Flossaid loyalist &amp; highly recommend this American brand.&lt;br /&gt; I luckily discovered Flossaid 20 years ago and I now get rave reviews after every check up!&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have bought many-many more for kids, grandkids and friends - they all thank me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I found Flossaid, my gums BLED A LOT because my fingers were just too big for manual flossing.&lt;br /&gt;This device EASILY reached waaay back to my crooked morals and roots. I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried every other brand but none worked as well. Flossaid is stronger, wider, more rigid (the Butler flosser bends/warps quickly &amp; does not allow enough room to move the floss up &amp; down below my gum line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device also allows me to dip floss into an antibacterial solution (prescription) that helps my gums a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It also helps me apply a prescription 1.1% fluoride solution to help my exposed/receding roots.  (I was born with bad teeth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy several Flossaids, you won&#x27;t regret it.  . . . . .  dave in austin, texas&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hate flossing without a holder of some sort. It hurts my fingers horribly(I have raynauds)&lt;br /&gt;However, I was tired of the cost and waste associated with disposable flossers that mostly just ripped apart between my tight teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went looking for something I could wrap with my own skinny/sturdy floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect in many ways. It&#x27;s strong, quality, doesn&#x27;t flex.  It does not feel like it would break or wear down. It had a small learning curve with angles as its a bit wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did downgrade one star as it doesn&#x27;t have a way to cut old floss off.</li>
            <li> This thing is no fun. If you&#x27;re like anyone and don&#x27;t really like taking the time to floss anyways, this thing is not going to help you. It&#x27;s a hassle.</li>
