            <li>We love this cream; introduced to this cream by my sister-in-law when she was living in El Paso, TX.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hand lotion for the winter.</li>
            <li>great cream, not too thick but provides excellent protection against dryness.</li>
            <li>I use it as a lotion for my feet, and I love that within seconds I can put my shoes on.  </li>
            <li>Great product and reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li>Works great - as good as anything I have ever used - and there have been numerous lotions and creams.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions and creams and body butters.</li>
            <li>It was mostly just grease.</li>
            <li>For some reason I couldn&#x27;t remember the name so in my house it is called Moo Boob cream. :-)</li>
            <li>Love it.....</li>
            <li>Love all the UDDER skin care products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok I guess.</li>
            <li>BEST STUFF ALL YEAR LONG</li>
            <li>It is quite wonderful just for dry hands.</li>
            <li>Dry skin has plagued me for years and this product is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Udderly Smooth Creme for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this udderly smooth cream, it so inexpensive</li>
            <li>They liked it because it was scentless, non greasy, and absorbed well.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very light and clean.</li>
            <li>, it is not greasy and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>Pack easily.</li>
            <li>This is the best hand cream hands down.</li>
            <li>and it helps smooth my hands and arms.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a no brainer with Udderly Smooth creme.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ever since I tried Udderly Smooth Creme, I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li>I use this product as my primary moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Since I am a diabetic, this product does a fantastic job on my feet and hands.</li>
            <li>It is creamy and light on the skin without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Udderly smooth isn&#x27;t greasy once it dries.  </li>
            <li>It feels smooth, absorbs well, isn&#x27;t greasy or runny and does the job.</li>
            <li>I was having trouble finding this wonderful creme.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me any smooth feelings.</li>
            <li>This is extremely important to me as I use my hands to work on the computer and play the guitar throughout the day.</li>
            <li>My hands always crack in the winter unless I use Udderly Smooth Creme.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth and when I loaned some to my brother</li>
            <li>None of it compares to Udderly Smooth.</li>
            <li>This stuff workds great and hands and feet are getting back their smoothiness.</li>
            <li>I just purchased a six pack of the Udderly smooth hand and body cream.</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant fragrance and is definitely non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>My brother-in-law, a contractor, originally told me about it.</li>
            <li>I had originally gotten some sample packs from my mother from the AADE 13 conference in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li>Lotion worked great on my aging dry skin.</li>
            <li>This works great on dry skin.</li>
            <li>The cream is fantastic, and I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>It is by far, my favorite!</li>
            <li>So I decided to give it a try: the price was right!  </li>
            <li>Soaks in right away and never ever feels greasy!</li>
            <li>I first learned of this product from an online discussion group for fine needleworking - to smooth the hands without staining fiber or fabric.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hands nice and soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, absorbs well into the skin, aids healing of dry cracked hands and has a pleasant, clean, scent.</li>
            <li>Thought I was getting a deal, but found out friend buys it from local pharmacy $2.49 for the size tube.sometimes best to shop locally.</li>
            <li>clears up chapped hands quickly.</li>
            <li>This lotion is not greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>Better than high end creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this product for a long time</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not  paying as much attention, but come summer, full steam ahead on the Udder Crème!</li>
            <li>What is amazing about this lotion is it is TOTALLY non greasy.  </li>
            <li>Works fast and makes skin smooth again.</li>
            <li>and i was constantly just flaking everywhere if i smiled.</li>
            <li>I ordered 5 tubes so I can keep in different rooms to keep it handy.  </li>
            <li>I get the more sensitive to preservatives and scents I get.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t treat it right with medicine cream too).  </li>
            <li>The right price for a quality body/hand cream.  </li>
            <li>The product soaks right in and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Scent is very light and barely detectable.</li>
            <li>One of the areas on the top of my knee looks like a bruise, a full patch of veins on the back of both knees.&lt;br</li>
            <li>we use this for traveling and it works great in small tube</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for anyone with dry cracked hands, especially those of us who live in the desert.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, not greasy, perfect for winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased the 4oz.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy or sticky and after just one application my hands are soft smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This works better than most hand/skin creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, I have extremely dry skin, I am undergoing chemotherapy and this is the only lotion that keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>Then this winter my hands were ridiculously dry and decided to get some more.</li>
            <li>I love This lotion as it suits my needs as it has no scent or greasy feel but smoothes dry hands very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s all I really need from a hand creme</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I have had eczema from head to toe my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled onto this lotion from a family member (everyone is always trying to help).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I should really invest in the pump size.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Also, delivery occurred much fasted than I anticipated (4 days).</li>
            <li>I went and bought more because I don&#x27;t know if this is still in production due to not seeing it in Walmart anymore.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry southwestern climate and these tubes of Udderly Soft Creme are handy to carry in one&#x27;s purse or in the console of a vehicle.  </li>
            <li>great product....not commonly found locally</li>
            <li>I have known about Udder Crème for years, but I ordered it for a particular problem....</li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>but the result is better than most of expensive cream.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the large container since I used up the old one.  </li>
            <li>My skin is extraordinarily sensitive (I&#x27;m a redhead with type one skin) and this stuff saves me!!</li>
            <li>I love this product, found it at Walmart a few months ago, then then stopped stocking it )</li>
            <li>Slightly different formula than what comes in the tub, but absorbs just as quickly and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>As an avid needleworker I find it a necessary find.  </li>
            <li>I use it all the time, first thing in the morning and the last time before going to bed.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent (almost no scent at all) and it absorbs quickly, without the oily feeling some lotions leave behind.</li>
            <li>and it always gets so dry and irritated, prior to buying udderly smooth</li>
            <li>I have mild eczema along with all the above, and it helps keep it calmed down more than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li>Hard to find glad to have found it here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better late than never.</li>
            <li>It never leaves my hands greasy and my skin is always soft.  </li>
            <li>i can still wear makeup for my job and applying it once or twice, even three times on my face every day left no greasy residue (unless i applied it every 10 minutes of course) and helped my skin stay very moisturized.</li>
            <li>At 54 years old, I have had spider vein problems for probably 12 years --</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find it anywhere lately</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for use on my face.</li>
            <li>It absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I hate the greasy feeling most effective hand creams give you.  </li>
            <li>I can easily pick up the task where I left off in less than 10 minutes after application.</li>
            <li>i applied several expensive, top of the line products to my face and they caused burning, itching, redness, peeling, and even more dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry living in the desert as I do, and Udderly Smooth keeps it moisturized and soft even in this dry climate.</li>
            <li>My hands was so dry and cracking, I use the cream for few days and the cracking is much better.</li>
            <li>It has a nice soft sent that is not too overpowering and moisturizes dry areas extremely well without the long lasting greasy film that is associated with some creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>If you need something that will work fast and keep on working long after you put it on, this is the cream for you.</li>
            <li>I have been too lazy and cheap to buy it.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what was described and what I expected.</li>
            <li>Udderly Smooth sticks to its humble roots and stays simple.  </li>
            <li>and this helps keep my nails strong and thick.</li>
            <li>Does the same work and more to keep my skin soft as other far more expensive items claim!</li>
            <li>No other cream</li>
            <li>Years ago I had a major problem with cracking of my feet even to the point of hospitalization.</li>
            <li>works quickly and lasts on rough dry skin.</li>
            <li>Wow, instant results.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>It is marked as hand cream, but the contents are the same, and in the same order, as the body cream.</li>
            <li>I am a 65 year old man who has a problem with very dry skin.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It is a great very light moisturizer that works.</li>
            <li> I order it through Amazon now, and am so very glad I still have access to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!</li>

            <li> Love this stuff !</li>
            <li> Great product and received quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad and my boyfriend who do a lot of work outdoors and had kind of scaly fingers and palms.  </li>
            <li> This is the absolute best hand lotion or cream you can find.</li>
            <li> To be honest it reminds me of dipper rash cream.</li>
            <li> Very mild pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This creme is one of my top favorite products!</li>
            <li> Udderly smooth cream is a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The member who led me in the direction of Udderly Smooth products had good things to say about it....</li>
            <li> This creme is very good, maybe a bigger tube would be nice.</li>
            <li> The best cream, especially for peeling skin caused by chemo drug.</li>
            <li> Even the podiatrist is amazed at how smooth my wife&#x27;s feet are now!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> and I have used many have been close to this one.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a tube to put in my purse.</li>

            <li> Great price, shipped fast, arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Their hands looked and felt better after about a week&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> but I just prefer scented :)</li>
            <li> We love this cream; introduced to this cream by my sister-in-law when she was living in El Paso, TX.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hand lotion for the winter.</li>
            <li> great cream, not too thick but provides excellent protection against dryness.</li>
            <li> I use it as a lotion for my feet, and I love that within seconds I can put my shoes on.  </li>
            <li> Great product and reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Works great - as good as anything I have ever used - and there have been numerous lotions and creams.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions and creams and body butters.</li>
            <li> It was mostly just grease.</li>
            <li> For some reason I couldn&#x27;t remember the name so in my house it is called Moo Boob cream. :-)</li>
            <li> Love it.....</li>
            <li> Love all the UDDER skin care products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I guess.</li>
            <li> BEST STUFF ALL YEAR LONG</li>
            <li> It is quite wonderful just for dry hands.</li>
            <li> Dry skin has plagued me for years and this product is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Udderly Smooth Creme for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love this udderly smooth cream, it so inexpensive</li>
            <li> They liked it because it was scentless, non greasy, and absorbed well.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very light and clean.</li>
            <li> , it is not greasy and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> Pack easily.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream hands down.</li>
            <li> and it helps smooth my hands and arms.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a no brainer with Udderly Smooth creme.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ever since I tried Udderly Smooth Creme, I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I use this product as my primary moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Since I am a diabetic, this product does a fantastic job on my feet and hands.</li>
            <li> It is creamy and light on the skin without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Udderly smooth isn&#x27;t greasy once it dries.  </li>
            <li> It feels smooth, absorbs well, isn&#x27;t greasy or runny and does the job.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this wonderful creme.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give me any smooth feelings.</li>
            <li> This is extremely important to me as I use my hands to work on the computer and play the guitar throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My hands always crack in the winter unless I use Udderly Smooth Creme.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth and when I loaned some to my brother</li>
            <li> None of it compares to Udderly Smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff workds great and hands and feet are getting back their smoothiness.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a six pack of the Udderly smooth hand and body cream.</li>
            <li> It has a light, pleasant fragrance and is definitely non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> My brother-in-law, a contractor, originally told me about it.</li>
            <li> I had originally gotten some sample packs from my mother from the AADE 13 conference in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li> Lotion worked great on my aging dry skin.</li>
            <li> This works great on dry skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is fantastic, and I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> It is by far, my favorite!</li>
            <li> So I decided to give it a try: the price was right!  </li>
            <li> Soaks in right away and never ever feels greasy!</li>
            <li> I first learned of this product from an online discussion group for fine needleworking - to smooth the hands without staining fiber or fabric.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hands nice and soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, absorbs well into the skin, aids healing of dry cracked hands and has a pleasant, clean, scent.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting a deal, but found out friend buys it from local pharmacy $2.49 for the size tube.sometimes best to shop locally.</li>
            <li> clears up chapped hands quickly.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> Better than high end creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product for a long time</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not  paying as much attention, but come summer, full steam ahead on the Udder Crème!</li>
            <li> What is amazing about this lotion is it is TOTALLY non greasy.  </li>
            <li> Works fast and makes skin smooth again.</li>
            <li> and i was constantly just flaking everywhere if i smiled.</li>
            <li> I ordered 5 tubes so I can keep in different rooms to keep it handy.  </li>
            <li> I get the more sensitive to preservatives and scents I get.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t treat it right with medicine cream too).  </li>
            <li> The right price for a quality body/hand cream.  </li>
            <li> The product soaks right in and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Scent is very light and barely detectable.</li>
            <li> One of the areas on the top of my knee looks like a bruise, a full patch of veins on the back of both knees.&lt;br</li>
            <li> we use this for traveling and it works great in small tube</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for anyone with dry cracked hands, especially those of us who live in the desert.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, not greasy, perfect for winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased the 4oz.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy or sticky and after just one application my hands are soft smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This works better than most hand/skin creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I have extremely dry skin, I am undergoing chemotherapy and this is the only lotion that keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Then this winter my hands were ridiculously dry and decided to get some more.</li>
            <li> I love This lotion as it suits my needs as it has no scent or greasy feel but smoothes dry hands very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s all I really need from a hand creme</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema from head to toe my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled onto this lotion from a family member (everyone is always trying to help).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I should really invest in the pump size.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Also, delivery occurred much fasted than I anticipated (4 days).</li>
            <li> I went and bought more because I don&#x27;t know if this is still in production due to not seeing it in Walmart anymore.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry southwestern climate and these tubes of Udderly Soft Creme are handy to carry in one&#x27;s purse or in the console of a vehicle.  </li>
            <li> great product....not commonly found locally</li>
            <li> I have known about Udder Crème for years, but I ordered it for a particular problem....</li>
            <li> The older</li>
            <li> but the result is better than most of expensive cream.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the large container since I used up the old one.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extraordinarily sensitive (I&#x27;m a redhead with type one skin) and this stuff saves me!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, found it at Walmart a few months ago, then then stopped stocking it )</li>
            <li> Slightly different formula than what comes in the tub, but absorbs just as quickly and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> As an avid needleworker I find it a necessary find.  </li>
            <li> I use it all the time, first thing in the morning and the last time before going to bed.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent (almost no scent at all) and it absorbs quickly, without the oily feeling some lotions leave behind.</li>
            <li> and it always gets so dry and irritated, prior to buying udderly smooth</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema along with all the above, and it helps keep it calmed down more than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> Hard to find glad to have found it here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better late than never.</li>
            <li> It never leaves my hands greasy and my skin is always soft.  </li>
            <li> i can still wear makeup for my job and applying it once or twice, even three times on my face every day left no greasy residue (unless i applied it every 10 minutes of course) and helped my skin stay very moisturized.</li>
            <li> At 54 years old, I have had spider vein problems for probably 12 years --</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find it anywhere lately</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough for use on my face.</li>
            <li> It absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I hate the greasy feeling most effective hand creams give you.  </li>
            <li> I can easily pick up the task where I left off in less than 10 minutes after application.</li>
            <li> i applied several expensive, top of the line products to my face and they caused burning, itching, redness, peeling, and even more dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry living in the desert as I do, and Udderly Smooth keeps it moisturized and soft even in this dry climate.</li>
            <li> My hands was so dry and cracking, I use the cream for few days and the cracking is much better.</li>
            <li> It has a nice soft sent that is not too overpowering and moisturizes dry areas extremely well without the long lasting greasy film that is associated with some creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> If you need something that will work fast and keep on working long after you put it on, this is the cream for you.</li>
            <li> I have been too lazy and cheap to buy it.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what was described and what I expected.</li>
            <li> Udderly Smooth sticks to its humble roots and stays simple.  </li>
            <li> and this helps keep my nails strong and thick.</li>
            <li> Does the same work and more to keep my skin soft as other far more expensive items claim!</li>
            <li> No other cream</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a major problem with cracking of my feet even to the point of hospitalization.</li>
            <li> works quickly and lasts on rough dry skin.</li>
            <li> Wow, instant results.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> It is marked as hand cream, but the contents are the same, and in the same order, as the body cream.</li>
            <li> I am a 65 year old man who has a problem with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have had the injections four times; it seemed to work the first two times; no results on the last two tries (and lots of $$ down the drain).  </li>
            <li> I have serious eczema on my hands and this cream absorbs quickly and really helps smooth out the painful dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that helps my husband&#x27;s cracked, dry hands.</li>
            <li> Helps immensely with dry and/or cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> this website tries to give natural solutions to your health issues (they cleared up one GIANT health mystery a few years back, so I&#x27;m a believer).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely dry there and was the only thing that helped keep her hands from being too dry.  </li>
            <li> However now that I have five tubes I will not run out in a long while.</li>
            <li> but it does the job on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone who has to deal with dry skin, cracking skin, flaking skin, or eczema.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs into the skin like water to a dry sponge without that oily residual feeling.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bunch to have one in every room all winter since I have painfully dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I recently had winter skin on my face so horribly,and because of my job as a server i have to constantly wear makeup, so my face was always having harsh makeup remover wipes rubbing against it.</li>
            <li> I am a quilter, and my hands get very dry.  </li>
            <li> Minimal to no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This lotion soaks into your skin without leaving that weird greasy sensation and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t get as dry or irritated as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it does, but with regular use (two weeks), my areas faded!!  </li>
            <li> He works in construction and has cracked, brutal hands but has always refused to use any kind of lotion saying it makes his hands greasy.  </li>
            <li> I happened to stumble on a small sample bottle one day in a relative&#x27;s house and used a small dab.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just hydrating a little bit.</li>
            <li> I try to put it on everyday</li>
            <li> The soap we use at work in the ladies washroom is so harsh on my hands that I have to keep lotion at my desk.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy</li>
            <li> so I went without for a few years.</li>
            <li> A few people at work borrowed mine and now use it as well.</li>
            <li> apparently all the nurses at work have become obsessed as well.  </li>
            <li> Very little scent and not oily.</li>
            <li> Smell it not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on my hands.</li>
            <li> I had used it in the past, but the store that I used to buy it from stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> worked so hard.</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> I mean.</li>
            <li> I use it on elbows and feet; my elbows used to be the absolute worst one</li>
            <li> but ti&#x27;s expensive to buyat stores</li>
            <li> it was so bad that the crease between my cheek and my nostril was cracking and bleeding when i talk</li>

            <li> Lotion worked great on my aging dry skin.</li>
            <li> The best cream, especially for peeling skin caused by chemo drug.</li>
            <li> Even the podiatrist is amazed at how smooth my wife&#x27;s feet are now!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s moisturizes well without making my hands feel oily or greasy. I work with animals and end up washing my hands a lot and this helps keep my nails strong and thick. I do end up using 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for those of us with aging skin.  I try to put it on everyday and it helps smooth my hands and arms.</li>
            <li> I am a 65 year old man who has a problem with very dry skin. No other cream and I have used many have been close to this one. If you need something that will work fast and keep on working long after you put it on, this is the cream for you. I wish I would have found this cream years ago but it&#x27;s better late than never.</li>

            <li> This works great on dry skin. My mom used it as a moisturizer when she was taking chemo.</li>
            <li> Omg!!! This lotion is amazing!! It never leaves my hands greasy and my skin is always soft.  I will be purchasing this again!!!</li>
            <li> I recently had winter skin on my face so horribly,and because of my job as a server i have to constantly wear makeup, so my face was always having harsh makeup remover wipes rubbing against it. it was so bad that the crease between my cheek and my nostril was cracking and bleeding when i talk and i was constantly just flaking everywhere if i smiled. i applied several expensive, top of the line products to my face and they caused burning, itching, redness, peeling, and even more dry, irritated skin. i went to the store and applied this cream on my FACE, and it instantly soothed my face, and healed my cracks without any pain and immense relief. i can still wear makeup for my job and applying it once or twice, even three times on my face every day left no greasy residue (unless i applied it every 10 minutes of course) and helped my skin stay very moisturized.</li>

            <li> BEST STUFF ALL YEAR LONG</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a tube to put in my purse.</li>
            <li> clears up chapped hands quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that helps my husband&#x27;s cracked, dry hands.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else my wife has tried</li>
            <li> very good creme. used by nurses so i&#x27;m told</li>
            <li> Works great with the eczema I get on my hands and it is not oily. It is the best stuff I have tried for my condition and I have tried a lot! I keep a tube in my vehicles so I always have some on hand.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It moisturizes your skin without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I really need from a hand creme so it&#x27;s a no brainer with Udderly Smooth creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try some.</li>
            <li> I have known about Udder Crème for years, but I ordered it for a particular problem....spider veins!  What??  I follow The People&#x27;s Pharmacy.com -- this website tries to give natural solutions to your health issues (they cleared up one GIANT health mystery a few years back, so I&#x27;m a believer).  At 54 years old, I have had spider vein problems for probably 12 years -- I have had the injections four times; it seemed to work the first two times; no results on the last two tries (and lots of $$ down the drain).  One of the areas on the top of my knee looks like a bruise, a full patch of veins on the back of both knees.&lt;br /&gt;The People&#x27;s Pharmacy listed Udder Crème as a solution....I&#x27;m not sure what it does, but with regular use (two weeks), my areas faded!!  They did not vanish, but they faded.  If my areas were a &#x27;10&#x27; when I started, one month later they were a &#x27;4-5&#x27;.  I THINK THAT IS HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;Now that it is winter and &#x27;jean season&#x27;, I&#x27;m not  paying as much attention, but come summer, full steam ahead on the Udder Crème!</li>
            <li> Best cream ever for dryness.</li>
            <li> I love This lotion as it suits my needs as it has no scent or greasy feel but smoothes dry hands very well. I have not been able to find it anywhere lately so I ordered 10 to have on hand!!</li>
            <li> The soap we use at work in the ladies washroom is so harsh on my hands that I have to keep lotion at my desk. Ever since I tried Udderly Smooth Creme, I will never use anything else. Perfect for the working hands.</li>
            <li> I use this product as my primary moisturizer.  Since I am a diabetic, this product does a fantastic job on my feet and hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this hand cream for years. My brother-in-law, a contractor, originally told me about it. I LOVE it&#x27;s smoothness, it is not greasy and rubs in easily. Great product that works well. Scent is very light and barely detectable.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever/  Absorbs quickly, not greasy, perfect for winter dry skin.  I use it everywhere - hands, feet, legs.  It&#x27;s great for paper cuts too.  I bought one for all of our administrative staff that help with mailings, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Udderly Smooth Creme for many years.  It has a light, pleasant fragrance and is definitely non-greasy.  This is the first time I purchased the 4oz. size...much more convenient for travel.  The tub container is great for easier access at home.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. Very mild pleasant scent. Minimal to no greasy feeling. Makes skin look and feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> BEST CREAM FOR WRINKLES EVER</li>
            <li> This product is well known and is a pleasure to use. It was shipped at an excellent price compared to what I would have had to pay on a retail basis. The product was ordered last minute as a Christmas gift and it arrived timely. The recipient loved getting a 5 pack!</li>
            <li> Udderly smooth cream is a good moisturizer.  I ordered 5 tubes so I can keep in different rooms to keep it handy.  I have used it on my diabetic husband since last year.  I also ordered the large container since I used up the old one.  It works.</li>
            <li> I am a quilter, and my hands get very dry.  This stuff is the best.  It&#x27;s not greasy, and leaves no trace on your skin after you use it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for carrying in my purse to get my favorite moisturizer on the go. Slightly different formula than what comes in the tub, but absorbs just as quickly and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Delivered timely, neatly, and the product is great!</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever!  Silky smooth!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I have extremely dry skin, I am undergoing chemotherapy and this is the only lotion that keeps my skin hydrated. It is creamy and light on the skin without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I hate the greasy feeling most effective hand creams give you.  Udderly smooth isn&#x27;t greasy once it dries.  Works really well!</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry southwestern climate and these tubes of Udderly Soft Creme are handy to carry in one&#x27;s purse or in the console of a vehicle.  It feels smooth, absorbs well, isn&#x27;t greasy or runny and does the job.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this wonderful creme.  As an avid needleworker I find it a necessary find.  Now I have to re-order because my husband has discovered it, too.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream hands down. It leaves your hands nice and soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the best body cream I have found.  The older I get the more sensitive to preservatives and scents I get.  Udderly Smooth sticks to its humble roots and stays simple.  It isn&#x27;t heavy but it does the job on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not greasy and it absorbs quickly.It is gentle enough for use on my face. It is by far, my favorite!</li>
            <li> Great 5 pack of this lotion - perfect to have one at home, in a bag, in the car, in lab, etc. Great price, shipped fast, arrived as described.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad and my boyfriend who do a lot of work outdoors and had kind of scaly fingers and palms.  They liked it because it was scentless, non greasy, and absorbed well.  Their hands looked and felt better after about a week&#x27;s use.  I like using it too, but I just prefer scented :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too sticky. It doesn&#x27;t give me any smooth feelings. It&#x27;s just hydrating a little bit. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy.  Does its job well.  Recommended by my Dad&#x27;s oncology team as one of the best moisturizing products and this product does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> We go through about 1 tube of this stuff a week.  It is not greasy, absorbs well into the skin, aids healing of dry cracked hands and has a pleasant, clean, scent.</li>
            <li> Better than high end creams. Its smoothe and silky . works quickly and lasts on rough dry skin.</li>
            <li> We love this cream; introduced to this cream by my sister-in-law when she was living in El Paso, TX.  It&#x27;s extremely dry there and was the only thing that helped keep her hands from being too dry.  Best hand cream around. We keep it by the kitchen sink and use it after we wash the dishes.</li>
            <li> I have used just about every lotion out there. I have had eczema from head to toe my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled onto this lotion from a family member (everyone is always trying to help).&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe the change! I love this lotion! I bought up a ton of it.&lt;br /&gt;The scaling on my legs that my dermatologist said would never go away is gone in four days treatment and my arms and face look great.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying from here on out.</li>
            <li> This creme is very good, maybe a bigger tube would be nice. Also would like the unscented product. That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Perfect for gift bags my organization was preparing.  Great price!  Item was as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best hand lotion or cream you can find. I have been dealing with eczema on my hands and fingers for my entire life and after all the doctors visits and prescriptions and lotions and remedies have found this to be the trick. I use it at least twice a day. It has a nice soft sent that is not too overpowering and moisturizes dry areas extremely well without the long lasting greasy film that is associated with some creams and lotions. This is extremely important to me as I use my hands to work on the computer and play the guitar throughout the day. I can easily pick up the task where I left off in less than 10 minutes after application. I have this on my permanent subscribe and save and if I had room would buy it by the gallon.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand lotion for the winter. It is not greasy and it works. My hands always crack in the winter unless I use Udderly Smooth Creme. There have been a couple winters were I have been too lazy and cheap to buy it. However now that I have five tubes I will not run out in a long while. And I can keep one in my purse, one in the car, one at work, and one in the kitchen. This creme is one of my top favorite products!</li>
            <li> I can take these tubes wherever I go. Pack easily. The cream is fantastic, and I cannot say enough good things about it. It is marked as hand cream, but the contents are the same, and in the same order, as the body cream.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.  He works in construction and has cracked, brutal hands but has always refused to use any kind of lotion saying it makes his hands greasy.  But not this stuff.  I gave a tube to my sister in law who is a nurse and apparently all the nurses at work have become obsessed as well.  I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin but I get it- it moisturizers instantly, doesn&#x27;t require reapplication, &amp; isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> great cream, not too thick but provides excellent protection against dryness.</li>
            <li> I have serious eczema on my hands and this cream absorbs quickly and really helps smooth out the painful dry skin. The smell is very light and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this udderly smooth cream, it so inexpensive but the result is better than most of expensive cream. My hands was so dry and cracking, I use the cream for few days and the cracking is much better.</li>
            <li> Great product. Happy to find it here online since I had a problems finding it in the store.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great very light moisturizer that works. I sometimes even put it on my face.</li>
            <li> the best stuff around.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this lotion.  I had originally gotten some sample packs from my mother from the AADE 13 conference in Las Vegas.  What is amazing about this lotion is it is TOTALLY non greasy.  It absorbs completely.  I use it as a lotion for my feet, and I love that within seconds I can put my shoes on.  I keep using the 4 oz squeeze tubes but I should really invest in the pump size.  I have one in my purse, one by the bedside table, one in my desk at work, two in the living room and one in the bathroom.  I will continue to purchase this lotion for sure!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Keeps my skin smooth and when I loaned some to my brother it helped heal his cracked heels, as well as heal his eczema (temporarily, cuz it will come back it you don&#x27;t treat it right with medicine cream too).  I went and bought more because I don&#x27;t know if this is still in production due to not seeing it in Walmart anymore.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great product and reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this product, found it at Walmart a few months ago, then then stopped stocking it ); So when I found it here, I ordered several tubs of it. My skin is very dry living in the desert as I do, and Udderly Smooth keeps it moisturized and soft even in this dry climate. I think I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I have been  using this product for years.  It works great.  I would recomment this to all as a lubricant.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite hand lotion. It has a very mild scent (almost no scent at all) and it absorbs quickly, without the oily feeling some lotions leave behind. The farmers knew what they were doing with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent non greasy cream with nice smell, light feeling.  Like it a lot.  5 tubes let me have plenty to share with my friends.</li>
            <li> The right price for a quality body/hand cream.  Works great - as good as anything I have ever used - and there have been numerous lotions and creams.  Helps immensely with dry and/or cracked skin.  Not greasy.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse so my hands are constantly being washed and in and out of gloves all day. My skin is extraordinarily sensitive (I&#x27;m a redhead with type one skin) and this stuff saves me!! It&#x27;s non greasy or sticky and after just one application my hands are soft smooth and moisturized. I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions and creams and body butters. Some of them costing me $120+. None of it compares to Udderly Smooth. It&#x27;s the best!!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and it always gets so dry and irritated, prior to buying udderly smooth I mean. I happened to stumble on a small sample bottle one day in a relative&#x27;s house and used a small dab. My skin didn&#x27;t react at all, so I decided to buy some for myself. This lotion soaks into your skin without leaving that weird greasy sensation and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t get as dry or irritated as much as it used to. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I first learned of this product from an online discussion group for fine needleworking - to smooth the hands without staining fiber or fabric.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for almost 10 years, and my spouse uses it as well.  Both of us have replaced facial moisturizers as well.  I use it on elbows and feet; my elbows used to be the absolute worst one could imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack was an excellent value considering what the product retails for, if you can find a place that carries it consistently.  I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for cracking hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product for a long time but ti&#x27;s expensive to buyat stores so I went without for a few years. Then this winter my hands were ridiculously dry and decided to get some more. Lucky for me it&#x27;s sold on Amazon.  Woo woo!  This stuff workds great and hands and feet are getting back their smoothiness.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I can use on my hands. Smell it not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on my hands. A few people at work borrowed mine and now use it as well. Love this stuff !</li>
            <li> Wonderful product... Does the same work and more to keep my skin soft as other far more expensive items claim!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years,and it is great.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a six pack of the Udderly smooth hand and body cream. I suffer from psoriasis and was following a lead given on a forum for PsA (Psoriatic Arthritis)....The member who led me in the direction of Udderly Smooth products had good things to say about it....So I decided to give it a try: the price was right!  It did remove some of the &amp;#34;bumpiness&amp;#34; on  my face and softened some of the plaques. The product soaks right in and is not greasy. I would recommend this to anyone,not only a psoriasis sufferer.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this product 5 stars is because it is one of the best crèmes I have found, and I have tried many!  I had used it in the past, but the store that I used to buy it from stopped carrying it.  I order it through Amazon now, and am so very glad I still have access to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has to deal with dry skin, cracking skin, flaking skin, or eczema.  I have mild eczema along with all the above, and it helps keep it calmed down more than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my hands.  I use it all the time, first thing in the morning and the last time before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Great product and received quickly and in good condition. Gave to guys at work who work outside in all weather conditions.  Very little scent and not oily.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a major problem with cracking of my feet even to the point of hospitalization. I would try all of my wife&#x27;s creams. I bought the attic on the shelves. It was mostly just grease. One day I saw this stuff in Walmart&#x27;s. Wow, instant results. It literally soaks into your skin. Hard to find glad to have found it here at Amazon. Myloves it too. It works!!! For some reason I couldn&#x27;t remember the name so in my house it is called Moo Boob cream. :-)</li>
            <li> we use this for traveling and it works great in small tube</li>
            <li> Best hand cream I&#x27;ve come across yet! Soaks in right away and never ever feels greasy!</li>
            <li> great seller - delivered as promised!</li>
            <li> This product was introduced to me by a friend undergoing chemo therapy. It is quite wonderful just for dry hands. I like body version as well. Dry skin has plagued me for years and this product is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Love it.....</li>
            <li> this stuff works great to get the smoothest skin all over your body especially the bottom of your feet and hands that ate worked so hard.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for anyone with dry cracked hands, especially those of us who live in the desert.  It just works.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever made!!! Absorbs into the skin like water to a dry sponge without that oily residual feeling.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what was described and what I expected. Also, delivery occurred much fasted than I anticipated (4 days). Thank you.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hand and face cream--not greasy. I use it all the time.  The five tube version is a great deal and then you can put tubes everywhere.  I have one at work, one in my bag, a couple at home.</li>
            <li> Love all the UDDER skin care products.  This works better than most hand/skin creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  Two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Just so good.  Not smelly, not slimy. I ordered a bunch to have one in every room all winter since I have painfully dry skin.  No regrets.</li>
            <li> As advertised, good product, good proce</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I guess. I just don&#x27;t like how it feels and smells like an ointment. To be honest it reminds me of dipper rash cream. It also leaves a residue on things even when it feels like it&#x27;s all rubbed in.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream ever ! !  Works fast and makes skin smooth again.Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
