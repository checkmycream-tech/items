            <li>so I was thrilled to find it here for cheaper!</li>

            <li>and I remembered how good it was.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Mint Condition smells amazing.</li>
            <li>A friend borrowed it and liked it as well.</li>
            <li>Much better price wise.</li>
            <li>But my skin is still nicely colored even after the shower.</li>
            <li>Great for price (i believe i originally purchased for $60 at the salon).</li>
            <li>I tried this lotion for the first time yesterday and loved it!  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Swedish Beauty&#x27;s Mint Condition!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth, minty vanilla scent</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan easily and this lotion is by far the best out of the many I have tried.</li>
            <li>Out of all the lotions we carry (and they are all of top of the line)</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a cooling sensation</li>
            <li>Love love love Swedish beauty products and decided to try their botanica line with the mint.</li>
            <li>But with this lotion I see a difference :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>but I love the smell of mint.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>LOVE It.</li>
            <li>I do remember the cooling sensation and I love that.</li>
            <li>I love the cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>It made me feel nice and cool and tingly</li>
            <li>The light mint scent dissipates over time, but is cooling, refreshing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love the cool feeling.</li>
            <li>I had received a free sample packet of Mint Condition by Swedish Beauty and used it one day instead of my Kiwi Be Friends.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed in this product at all.</li>
            <li>i even though 65 dollars was worth my results!</li>
            <li>It is paraben free and 95% natural, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>I did stay cool in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>It smells very minty which is okay.</li>
            <li>So overall a good lotion.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>(NOT the reddening, hot sizzle, Pink Diamond kind of tingly), which was pleasant for 15 minutes in a hot tanning bed.</li>
            <li>When I asked how much it retailed for and the girl told me $75.00, I laughed out loud!</li>
            <li>it felt good to finally have a NEW and FULL bottle!</li>
            <li>It has a minty feel and keeps your skin cooler under those wonderfully hot bulbs!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s actually one of my favorite things about this product!</li>
            <li>and I want to do something after tanning and still feel fresh.</li>
            <li>this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fade instantly after tanning, which I liked as well.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just the right amount of smell.</li>
            <li>The girl at my salon said it was cool like the way icy hot is, a strong cool feeling on your skin</li>
            <li>I first tried this at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I was sold and wanted it after the first try</li>
            <li>I hope that you like it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>I purchased this as an alternative to using a tingle in the hot months.</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s decent lotion!</li>
            <li>There was no way I was going to spend that much</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say I got any darker from this</li>
            <li>I looked on here and was much cheaper than in the store anyways</li>
            <li>it was very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>otherwise I really like the feeling</li>
            <li>It was packaged well and brand new!</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my beauty products, and this is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>The lotion is not too thick, therefore making it very easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>And bronzes very natural.</li>
            <li>I will buy this though and alternate it with my tingle lotions for the days that are hot</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t get hot at all when using this.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer a strong tingle but tried this on a whim.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very silky and soft, even long after my tanning session.</li>
            <li>It has a light mint fragrance that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cooling bronzer, which I was not aware of when I used it for the first time, so I got a bit of a surprise when I rubbed it in.</li>
            <li>, the lotion is thick but it helps my tan and keeps me cool.</li>

            <li> , the lotion is thick but it helps my tan and keeps me cool.</li>
            <li> beware it can feel a little like Icy hot if you get it in your eyes and STUFF.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t last me as long as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering or crazy at all, which I love.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as this was my first lotion to buy online, but not to worry!</li>
            <li> , my boyfriend thought i didn&#x27;t tan at all since there was not much smell</li>
            <li> and my skin was not hot.</li>
            <li> Makes skin cooler due to mint.</li>
            <li> and I got a nice dark base tan in less than two weeks, not oily at all.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this lotion if you have a hard time tanning your legs like me</li>
            <li> My only complaint about it is the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> To me that is color wasted.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous, but it showed up today, April 7!</li>
            <li> The scent stayed with me all day, and I had very little to no after tan odor at all.</li>
            <li> I hate being hot</li>
            <li> Was a tad thick but who cares</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has been discontinued, so stock up!</li>
            <li> I started tanning at a salon and was getting really bad heat rash.</li>
            <li> but my legs seem to hate a tan.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not bad. A friend borrowed it and liked it as well.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion for the first time yesterday and loved it!  I usually prefer a strong tingle but tried this on a whim.  It has a light mint fragrance that is not overwhelming.  I did stay cool in the tanning bed. The girl at my salon said it was cool like the way icy hot is, a strong cool feeling on your skin but I didn&#x27;t experience that and she later said she hadn&#x27;t tried it yet.  I didn&#x27;t smell like tanning lotion or like I had been to the tanning bed after using it, my boyfriend thought i didn&#x27;t tan at all since there was not much smell and my skin was not hot. I don&#x27;t seem to be darker after one use like I am with my tingle lotions so that&#x27;s why I gave it four stars. I will buy this though and alternate it with my tingle lotions for the days that are hot and I want to do something after tanning and still feel fresh.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion makes you feel \\&quot;cooler\\&quot; in the tanning booth!  It has a minty feel and keeps your skin cooler under those wonderfully hot bulbs!  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this at my tanning salon. I was sold and wanted it after the first try but it was $80 there! There was no way I was going to spend that much so I was thrilled to find it here for cheaper! I LOVE this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon that just quit selling this lotion. Out of all the lotions we carry (and they are all of top of the line) this one is by far my favorite. I was skeptical as this was my first lotion to buy online, but not to worry! This is the real stuff. When we had this lotion we sold this at $75 bucks! So this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a cooling sensation but It&#x27;s decent lotion! I can&#x27;t really say I got any darker from this but it&#x27;s a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love love love Swedish beauty products and decided to try their botanica line with the mint. I definitely recommend this lotion if you have a hard time tanning your legs like me lol. I get way darker everywhere else but my legs seem to hate a tan. But with this lotion I see a difference :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but I love the smell of mint. Great bronzer it works but beware it can feel a little like Icy hot if you get it in your eyes and STUFF. Not disappointed in this product at all. Will be buying more when it runs out. Used a sticker and could make it out very brightly unlike when I tan without this.</li>
            <li> I hate being hot so I purchased this tanning lotion. It works! I actually don&#x27;t get hot at all when using this. I I&#x27;ve it, the lotion is thick but it helps my tan and keeps me cool.</li>
            <li> I love the cool feeling. This lotion broke my tanning plateau. I am medium olive toned and this took my tanning to the next level. I assure you this is an excellent price. I paid 65 dollars in the salon, and i even though 65 dollars was worth my results!</li>
            <li> I ran out of this lotion and asked my tanning place to get it again but they couldn&#x27;t. I looked on here and was much cheaper than in the store anyways, I ordered it but not thinking on the behalf of I needed it asap. The delivery date said April 10-24.... I was a little nervous, but it showed up today, April 7! I am impressed with the fast shipping! It was packaged well and brand new! it felt good to finally have a NEW and FULL bottle! Very impressed with this company! Would for sure order again from here!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan easily and this lotion is by far the best out of the many I have tried. LOVE It. will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this bottle at a tanning salon last year. I saw this and I remembered how good it was. I immediately purchased again. Great for price (i believe i originally purchased for $60 at the salon). I do remember the cooling sensation and I love that. Was a tad thick but who cares it was very moisturizing. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I had received a free sample packet of Mint Condition by Swedish Beauty and used it one day instead of my Kiwi Be Friends. I&#x27;m so glad that I did! Mint Condition smells amazing. It&#x27;s a very smooth, minty vanilla scent that&#x27;s just the right amount of smell. Not overpowering or crazy at all, which I love. The smell of the lotion doesn&#x27;t clash with the smell of my perfume. It didn&#x27;t fade instantly after tanning, which I liked as well. The scent stayed with me all day, and I had very little to no after tan odor at all. The lotion is not too thick, therefore making it very easy to rub in. It makes my skin feel very silky and soft, even long after my tanning session. It&#x27;s a cooling bronzer, which I was not aware of when I used it for the first time, so I got a bit of a surprise when I rubbed it in. That&#x27;s actually one of my favorite things about this product! It made me feel nice and cool and tingly (NOT the reddening, hot sizzle, Pink Diamond kind of tingly), which was pleasant for 15 minutes in a hot tanning bed. The bronzer was great, not streaky or orange in any way at all. I had a very beautiful, even golden brown color after tanning. It is paraben free and 95% natural, which is a nice bonus. After I used up my packet, I called around my local tanning salons to look for this lotion. No one carried it, but one salon offered to order it for me. When I asked how much it retailed for and the girl told me $75.00, I laughed out loud! Are you kidding me?! Good thing I found this on Amazon. I ordered two bottles at $17.80 each! Much better price wise. Bottom line, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Swedish Beauty&#x27;s Mint Condition! I am so happy that I found it! My only complaint about it is the size of the bottle. 8.5 fl. oz. won&#x27;t last me as long as I&#x27;d like it to. I am very picky about my beauty products, and this is by far one of my favorites. I hope that you like it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> I started tanning at a salon and was getting really bad heat rash. Thought I was going to have to stop going. But, using this lotion has solved my heat rash problem and I can go again! Also - I sometimes get heat rash in the summer and now I can use this when I am on vacation in hotter places and keep that from happening. Love this product! And love the Amazon.com price!</li>
            <li> It smells very minty which is okay. I love the cooling sensation. It gives me good color but I don&#x27;t like that when I get in the shower the next morning I can see the lotion waging of in the water. To me that is color wasted. But my skin is still nicely colored even after the shower. So overall a good lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great and I got a nice dark base tan in less than two weeks, not oily at all.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to using a tingle in the hot months. It smells great and is very smooth</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion.  The light mint scent dissipates over time, but is cooling, refreshing and moisturizing. Unfortunately it has been discontinued, so stock up!</li>
            <li> the only thing I don&#x27;t like about the lotion is the smell afterwards. I feel so gross. otherwise I really like the feeling and it definitely helps with not over-heating.</li>
            <li> Great authentic product</li>
            <li> Using this in a tanning bed. Makes skin cooler due to mint. And bronzes very natural. Bought 2 bottomless for summer.</li>
