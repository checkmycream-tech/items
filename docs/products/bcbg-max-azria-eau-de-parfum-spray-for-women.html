            <li>I love BCBG anyway, but I had been given this sample at a department store and just fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>That scent is definitely heavier, but still excellent.  </li>

            <li>WINNING</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of it on her.</li>
            <li>I love perfume</li>

            <li>just wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely lovely and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I needed some more, but didn&#x27;t want to pay department store prices.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance</li>
            <li>My husband noticed and let&#x27;s just say I got more kisses &amp; cuddles that day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of many perfumes, but this one is ok in my book.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>THIS BCBG GOT SO MANY MEN TURNING HEADS WHEN THEY GOT WITHIN 10 FT OF ME...</li>
            <li>and I thought to myself, well if it smells this good on paper, it has to smell even better right from the bottle.</li>
            <li>She was very excited to receive this product for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Sooooo excited to get it! :)</li>
            <li>I love putting it on as I am getting ready for the day, makes me feel endearingly sweet, sexy, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>SMELL PRETTY GOOD</li>
            <li>Wife loved the scent of this parfum and it was a better deal than buying at a large department store.</li>
            <li>Nice and very pretty bottle for display.  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite and the smell lasts all day :) i love smelling myself and so does my husband!</li>
            <li>ITS VERY SWEET.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value for a nice perfume, you get a  large bottle, 3.4 ounces, for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent &amp; the bottle is very pretty!  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li>It is a nice fresh scent for a working girl like me.</li>
            <li>good product, fast service,perfect gift for your Lady.first time to order this product</li>
            <li>excelent, very nice perfums, softly</li>
            <li>Quick and easy!</li>
            <li>The parfum has a very light sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite perfume right now!</li>
            <li>made sure the hubby knew as I showed him the magazine sample, he thought it smelled nice but worried it would be over powering as his nose can be sensitive to most perfumes.</li>
            <li>I love this scent - it&#x27;s somewhere between sweet and spicey.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was quick!</li>
            <li>I still think it smells amazing, but it does have somewhat of a cough syrup scent before it really settles into your skin.</li>
            <li>It has a light aroma that does not overwhelm you.</li>
            <li>&amp; I thought it fit the occasion.  </li>
            <li>I read some of the reviews and with the key notes of the fragrance itself was a great buying factor in my purchase.</li>
            <li>ITS CHEAP.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent everyday scent.</li>
            <li>Cheap too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great fragrance.</li>
            <li>You know you&#x27;ve bought the right one when you love it</li>
            <li>Kind of a fruity, sweet smell that sticks to her very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, airy, pretty, sexy, and not &amp;#34;overdone&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My new favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>She is enjoying it very much</li>
            <li>the bottle is beautiful and the smell is light flowery and last all day not overpowering very modern smell.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was so excited to smell</li>
            <li>First the price was fantastic!</li>
            <li>This size is worth the price!</li>
            <li>I originally bought at Macy&#x27;s for over $70 to wear on my wedding day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just make sure you try a sample at the store first</li>
            <li>BUT I HAVE THE ORIGINAL BOTTLE</li>
            <li>I like the sweet light smell of it.</li>
            <li>Very soft, feminine &amp; sweet smelling perfume, I love it!</li>
            <li>I will not say it lasts from 7 a.m. to evening, but I also did not use a lot as have not gone out anywhere special since just receiving it.</li>
            <li>It is the true perfume not a knock off.</li>
            <li>My nieces love this so much I had to hide the bottle</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet like a candy floral-ish scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh.</li>
            <li>Beautifully sweet and floral.</li>
            <li>I figure I just got lucky when I selected this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more highly recommend</li>
            <li>Great smelling perfume but the scent only last about 1-2 hours would not recommend, but LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li>the bottle is very pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells very pretty BTW.  </li>
            <li>It is not too deep a flowery scent, but there are deep undertones that are very pleasant.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells really and isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and sexy, but not heavy or overbearing.  </li>
            <li>its a pretty sent !</li>
            <li>and I saw this bottle I had never seen or heard of this one before for the sheer look of the bottle and the top pink and beautifully designed</li>
            <li>you are already excited when you see the box and open it to find the beautiful bottle top which looks like a pink flower and is made of a sturdy plastic that is flexible so not easily broken.</li>
            <li>She said even her husband, who rarely gives her compliments, made a comment about it.  </li>
            <li>The top notes are a bit much, but after a while it settles down nicely.</li>
            <li>This went right in the trash.</li>
            <li>I never got the right item.</li>
            <li>It is just right.</li>
            <li>The top looks like a large pink flower when you see it from the top.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this scent, and apparently so do males.  </li>
            <li>feminine soft and floral sweet scent!</li>
            <li>I receive this with a lot of expectation because always bcbg perfums are strong and smell from far.</li>
            <li>half an hour later I liked it even better!</li>
            <li>I purchased a big bottle and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>Very girlie, floral, fun, and lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell although it does not last all day!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SIZE VERY BIG.</li>
            <li>This bottle is pretty but doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>The first time she wore this perfume</li>
            <li>This is such a lovely perfume from the container to the scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY picky with perfumes and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li>Got this item delivered before expected time which was nice, I sprayed it on me and within an hour</li>
            <li>I would say somewhat like fruity ;)</li>
            <li>smelly like a pretty fower</li>
            <li>Layering a scent like this with a sweet, but mild body butter or lotion when you are fresh out of the shower helps the scent last longer.</li>
            <li>Pretty bottle with a large amount of parfum (perfume).  </li>
            <li>Just a normal fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It is sweet and soft yet sensual.</li>
            <li>Good perfume that has a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy fragrance to wear everyday and is even nice for a night out to dinner (especially if you don&#x27;t want to suffocate everybody around you).</li>
            <li>Fast shipping;</li>
            <li>Absolutely buying it again.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the real thing at BCBG, and this was not it.</li>
            <li>I found it to be much cheaper online with Amazon than the department stores, it was close to a fifty percent savings.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lighter scent, but I really think it can be worn all year.  </li>
            <li>The person that this gift was for really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>I really like this perfume</li>
            <li>a very naci shirt</li>
            <li>WHEN I SPRAY THE ONE I BOUGHT OFF THIS SITE, IT HAS AN ALCOHOL SCENT AND DOESNT HAVE THE POTENCY OF THE REAL STUFF.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really your choice.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable...</li>
            <li>I was just rising from a nights sleep while she got ready for work.  </li>
            <li>so much.......</li>
            <li>My husband is very picky about what I wear and this is one even he approves of.</li>
            <li>It had no potency and didn&#x27;t smell like the real thing either.</li>
            <li>Very feminine.</li>
            <li>AND I AM SOOOOO READY</li>
            <li>I was looking to buy her some more for Christmas before her other ran out.</li>
            <li>Love it and would recommend to other women..</li>
            <li>, nice flower smell, it just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet, reminds me of Britney Spears Fantasy and Snooki&#x27;s perfume she had released a while back</li>
            <li>Kind of chemically :/</li>
            <li>I do not regret buying it, but would not repurchase since it kind of smells like fruit juice :\  </li>
            <li>I love sweet yet subtle fragrances.</li>
            <li>My new fav perfume!</li>
            <li>I had a lot of compliments about my new fragrance!</li>
            <li>The price is an absolute bargain and I have added a new scent to my collection.  </li>
            <li>If your giving as a gift the fact that the bottle is an older design could be a glitch.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even have the same sticker on the bottom or same distributor as the authentic BCBG perfume does</li>
            <li>the only thing is that the scent fades away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like this okay, but it is a little over powering for me.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite everyday perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and this price was so much cheaper than it was at all other stores!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled this product when it first came out and been addictive every since.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Perfume came 2 days earlier and it is the real deal!</li>
            <li>First, (and maybe only women feel this way about BCBG or any designer&#x27;s packaging)</li>
            <li>This is a big attraction ;)</li>
            <li>When I want just a soft scent, I spray some in water and then rub the scented water on my arms.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lasting power ranges from three to four hours depending on how much you sprayed on yourself.</li>
            <li>Ordered and received within a couple of days , exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I thought I was just ordering the large bottle of perfume, but actually received the entire gift set.</li>
            <li>However, in spite of that one little con, it is a very pretty, yummy fragrance.</li>
            <li>If I put on what I would normally put on it overwhelms, if I put on less I really don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li>I was relatively surprised since it&#x27;s at such a discount!</li>
            <li>The perfume from department stores in bright pink, but this one was so watered down it was a pale yellow.</li>
            <li>and it does smell a little bit like cough syrup when you spray it at first.</li>
            <li>, smelled like an old lady, smelled like a cheap whore, or too heavy and could smell a mile away, or they smelled like everything else, or just plain stinky.</li>
            <li>It is sweet and flowery, yet subtle.</li>

            <li> Love this scent by BCBG.  </li>
            <li> I love BCBG anyway, but I had been given this sample at a department store and just fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> That scent is definitely heavier, but still excellent.  </li>
            <li> Smells okay.</li>

            <li> Its nice and light</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SENT</li>
            <li> yet it still doesn&#x27;t overtake you as some fragances will and yet will be more defining -</li>
            <li> WINNING</li>
            <li> and I love the smell of it on her.</li>

            <li> It smells absolutely lovely and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I needed some more, but didn&#x27;t want to pay department store prices.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance</li>
            <li> My husband noticed and let&#x27;s just say I got more kisses &amp; cuddles that day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of many perfumes, but this one is ok in my book.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> THIS BCBG GOT SO MANY MEN TURNING HEADS WHEN THEY GOT WITHIN 10 FT OF ME...</li>
            <li> and I thought to myself, well if it smells this good on paper, it has to smell even better right from the bottle.</li>
            <li> She was very excited to receive this product for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Sooooo excited to get it! :)</li>
            <li> I love putting it on as I am getting ready for the day, makes me feel endearingly sweet, sexy, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> SMELL PRETTY GOOD</li>
            <li> Wife loved the scent of this parfum and it was a better deal than buying at a large department store.</li>
            <li> Nice and very pretty bottle for display.  </li>
            <li> My absolute favorite and the smell lasts all day :) i love smelling myself and so does my husband!</li>
            <li> ITS VERY SWEET.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value for a nice perfume, you get a  large bottle, 3.4 ounces, for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent &amp; the bottle is very pretty!  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice fresh scent for a working girl like me.</li>
            <li> good product, fast service,perfect gift for your Lady.first time to order this product</li>
            <li> excelent, very nice perfums, softly</li>
            <li> Quick and easy!</li>
            <li> The parfum has a very light sweet smell.  </li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite perfume right now!</li>
            <li> made sure the hubby knew as I showed him the magazine sample, he thought it smelled nice but worried it would be over powering as his nose can be sensitive to most perfumes.</li>
            <li> I love this scent - it&#x27;s somewhere between sweet and spicey.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was quick!</li>
            <li> I still think it smells amazing, but it does have somewhat of a cough syrup scent before it really settles into your skin.</li>
            <li> It has a light aroma that does not overwhelm you.</li>
            <li> &amp; I thought it fit the occasion.  </li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews and with the key notes of the fragrance itself was a great buying factor in my purchase.</li>
            <li> ITS CHEAP.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent everyday scent.</li>
            <li> Cheap too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> You know you&#x27;ve bought the right one when you love it</li>
            <li> Kind of a fruity, sweet smell that sticks to her very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, airy, pretty, sexy, and not &amp;#34;overdone&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My new favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> She is enjoying it very much</li>
            <li> the bottle is beautiful and the smell is light flowery and last all day not overpowering very modern smell.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was so excited to smell</li>
            <li> First the price was fantastic!</li>
            <li> This size is worth the price!</li>
            <li> I originally bought at Macy&#x27;s for over $70 to wear on my wedding day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just make sure you try a sample at the store first</li>
            <li> BUT I HAVE THE ORIGINAL BOTTLE</li>
            <li> I like the sweet light smell of it.</li>
            <li> Very soft, feminine &amp; sweet smelling perfume, I love it!</li>
            <li> I will not say it lasts from 7 a.m. to evening, but I also did not use a lot as have not gone out anywhere special since just receiving it.</li>
            <li> It is the true perfume not a knock off.</li>
            <li> My nieces love this so much I had to hide the bottle</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet like a candy floral-ish scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Beautifully sweet and floral.</li>
            <li> I figure I just got lucky when I selected this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great smelling perfume but the scent only last about 1-2 hours would not recommend, but LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li> the bottle is very pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells very pretty BTW.  </li>
            <li> It is not too deep a flowery scent, but there are deep undertones that are very pleasant.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really and isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and sexy, but not heavy or overbearing.  </li>
            <li> its a pretty sent !</li>
            <li> and I saw this bottle I had never seen or heard of this one before for the sheer look of the bottle and the top pink and beautifully designed</li>
            <li> you are already excited when you see the box and open it to find the beautiful bottle top which looks like a pink flower and is made of a sturdy plastic that is flexible so not easily broken.</li>
            <li> She said even her husband, who rarely gives her compliments, made a comment about it.  </li>
            <li> The top notes are a bit much, but after a while it settles down nicely.</li>
            <li> This went right in the trash.</li>
            <li> I never got the right item.</li>
            <li> It is just right.</li>
            <li> The top looks like a large pink flower when you see it from the top.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this scent, and apparently so do males.  </li>
            <li> feminine soft and floral sweet scent!</li>
            <li> I receive this with a lot of expectation because always bcbg perfums are strong and smell from far.</li>
            <li> half an hour later I liked it even better!</li>
            <li> I purchased a big bottle and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Very girlie, floral, fun, and lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell although it does not last all day!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SIZE VERY BIG.</li>
            <li> This bottle is pretty but doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The first time she wore this perfume</li>
            <li> This is such a lovely perfume from the container to the scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY picky with perfumes and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Got this item delivered before expected time which was nice, I sprayed it on me and within an hour</li>
            <li> I would say somewhat like fruity ;)</li>
            <li> smelly like a pretty fower</li>
            <li> Layering a scent like this with a sweet, but mild body butter or lotion when you are fresh out of the shower helps the scent last longer.</li>
            <li> Pretty bottle with a large amount of parfum (perfume).  </li>
            <li> Just a normal fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It is sweet and soft yet sensual.</li>
            <li> Good perfume that has a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an easy fragrance to wear everyday and is even nice for a night out to dinner (especially if you don&#x27;t want to suffocate everybody around you).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping;</li>
            <li> Absolutely buying it again.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the real thing at BCBG, and this was not it.</li>
            <li> I found it to be much cheaper online with Amazon than the department stores, it was close to a fifty percent savings.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lighter scent, but I really think it can be worn all year.  </li>
            <li> The person that this gift was for really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume</li>
            <li> a very naci shirt</li>
            <li> WHEN I SPRAY THE ONE I BOUGHT OFF THIS SITE, IT HAS AN ALCOHOL SCENT AND DOESNT HAVE THE POTENCY OF THE REAL STUFF.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really your choice.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable...</li>
            <li> I was just rising from a nights sleep while she got ready for work.  </li>
            <li> so much.......</li>
            <li> My husband is very picky about what I wear and this is one even he approves of.</li>
            <li> It had no potency and didn&#x27;t smell like the real thing either.</li>
            <li> Very feminine.</li>
            <li> AND I AM SOOOOO READY</li>
            <li> I was looking to buy her some more for Christmas before her other ran out.</li>
            <li> Love it and would recommend to other women..</li>
            <li> , nice flower smell, it just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet, reminds me of Britney Spears Fantasy and Snooki&#x27;s perfume she had released a while back</li>
            <li> Kind of chemically :/</li>
            <li> I do not regret buying it, but would not repurchase since it kind of smells like fruit juice :\  </li>
            <li> I love sweet yet subtle fragrances.</li>
            <li> My new fav perfume!</li>
            <li> I had a lot of compliments about my new fragrance!</li>
            <li> The price is an absolute bargain and I have added a new scent to my collection.  </li>
            <li> If your giving as a gift the fact that the bottle is an older design could be a glitch.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even have the same sticker on the bottom or same distributor as the authentic BCBG perfume does</li>
            <li> the only thing is that the scent fades away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like this okay, but it is a little over powering for me.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite everyday perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and this price was so much cheaper than it was at all other stores!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled this product when it first came out and been addictive every since.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Perfume came 2 days earlier and it is the real deal!</li>
            <li> First, (and maybe only women feel this way about BCBG or any designer&#x27;s packaging)</li>
            <li> This is a big attraction ;)</li>
            <li> When I want just a soft scent, I spray some in water and then rub the scented water on my arms.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasting power ranges from three to four hours depending on how much you sprayed on yourself.</li>
            <li> Ordered and received within a couple of days , exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I thought I was just ordering the large bottle of perfume, but actually received the entire gift set.</li>
            <li> However, in spite of that one little con, it is a very pretty, yummy fragrance.</li>
            <li> If I put on what I would normally put on it overwhelms, if I put on less I really don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> I was relatively surprised since it&#x27;s at such a discount!</li>
            <li> The perfume from department stores in bright pink, but this one was so watered down it was a pale yellow.</li>
            <li> and it does smell a little bit like cough syrup when you spray it at first.</li>
            <li> , smelled like an old lady, smelled like a cheap whore, or too heavy and could smell a mile away, or they smelled like everything else, or just plain stinky.</li>
            <li> It is sweet and flowery, yet subtle.</li>
            <li> It included a large bottle of perfume, small bottle of perfume, body wash, and lotion.</li>
            <li> It was yellow, old, watered down, and smelled like urine.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 out 5 stars is because it&#x27;s a bit pricey and the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> BUT THE SMELL DOES NOT LAST LONG</li>
            <li> The scent however, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would when you spray it on.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> really last long maybe 4-5 hours ..</li>
            <li> Did not last long on my skin but decided to pass on to my neice and stays on her with no problem.  </li>
            <li> This smells like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret type perfume; a scent for someone young, maybe even high school.</li>
            <li> Everyone was shocked that I actually liked it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally a fan of fruity scents but this one is wearable.</li>
            <li> Arrive before I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not all that</li>
            <li> Total waste of $$$$$.</li>
            <li> I do prefer sweeter scents over musky fragrances (especially during the warmer seasons), so I may be a little partial in this review due to that preference.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I am using this after they recommended it to me in a departmnet store and decided to order it since I was unable to buy it at the time.</li>
            <li> i bought this perfume for my daughter michele as i did for my other daughter elisa also for a passover gift.  </li>
            <li> But its actually really average smelling.</li>
            <li> Everyday use</li>
            <li> You can go on the heavy side with this fragance and</li>
            <li> I would ONLY wear Eternity since 1995 because I hated everything else...too strong, too heavy, too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;, too heavy, too light, too nasty, putrid</li>
            <li> I received it on time, not sure how it is cause i bought it as a gift</li>
            <li> it say no more</li>
            <li> This perfume is not authentic.</li>
            <li> Not sure why its being discontinued.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when i received it through Amazon did not lasts as long as the one at the mall did.  </li>
            <li> While I like the smell, the smell doesn&#x27;t last at all, so that&#x27;s a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have been a one-perfume woman for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> Garbage watered down fake.</li>
            <li> Address was bad and they sent it back.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT REAL!!!!!!</li>
            <li> And worse part is Amazon will not let you return it because they labeled it &amp;#34;Hazardous goods&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed and would not buy it again.  </li>
            <li> AND THE LETTERING IS WRONG AND</li>
            <li> I wear this during the work week instead of my expensive perfumes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got the vanilla and sandalwood base to it, which I&#x27;m a sucker for anyway.  </li>
            <li> Nimodo :(</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed about the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!!</li>

            <li> I though it would have had a unique beautiful smell. But its actually really average smelling. Just a normal fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping; very satisfied.  This  smells great!</li>
            <li> Love the scent &amp; the bottle is very pretty!  Bought as a gift.</li>
            <li> It is a nice fresh scent for a working girl like me. It is the first time I am using this after they recommended it to me in a departmnet store and decided to order it since I was unable to buy it at the time.</li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume inside the page of a magazine last month and I thought to myself, well if it smells this good on paper, it has to smell even better right from the bottle. I immediately began to search for this perfume and found it on Amazon at a great price! When it arrived, I was so excited to smell it&#x27;s fragrance again. This perfume smells amazing and is not too strong. I purchased a big bottle and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Awesome package. Awesome smell. Arrive before I expected. Absolutely buying it again.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 lovely,. thanks</li>
            <li> Nice scent.. Not one of my favorites but nice..</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance...great price too!</li>
            <li> Amazing fragrance, great deal love it! I&#x27;ll buy more highly recommend</li>
            <li> Fragrance last all day.</li>
            <li> Wife loved the scent of this parfum and it was a better deal than buying at a large department store.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your prompt shipment of this item.  I had bought the perfumed body cream and was waiting for the spray.  This fragrance is wonderful!  Will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> So good, not too strong, and it lasts. will buy again.</li>
            <li> very good purchase and on time.</li>
            <li> First the price was fantastic! The fragrance is incredible!! The delivery was quick! I could not be happier with my purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing.  The same size bottle sells at Macy&#x27;s for $175.  The price is an absolute bargain and I have added a new scent to my collection.  Amazon is the best place to find great deals.</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly, was packaged well and the quality was excellent. If your giving as a gift the fact that the bottle is an older design could be a glitch. Otherwise the price and delivery make this one of the best deals around.</li>
            <li> The product is great, love it, very fast delivery, great price, always get compliments on it. I will definitely by again, keep stocking it.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent...love it!</li>
            <li> This size is worth the price! No where else have I been able to find this kind of bargain. It is the true perfume not a knock off.</li>
            <li> everyone loves the smell</li>
            <li> Smells sweet, reminds me of Britney Spears Fantasy and Snooki&#x27;s perfume she had released a while back</li>
            <li> This went right in the trash. It was yellow, old, watered down, and smelled like urine. I&#x27;ve bought the real thing at BCBG, and this was not it.</li>
            <li> Truly love this fragrance.  Very girlie, floral, fun, and lasts forever.  Good job BCBG Max Azria!!!  Will always love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Packaged well great product.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, one of my favorites.  I love sweet yet subtle fragrances. If you like Flowerbomb or Givency, you will love Bcbg Max Azria.  I found it to be much cheaper online with Amazon than the department stores, it was close to a fifty percent savings.....</li>
            <li> When I first smelled this fragrance, I thought it was incredible. I still think it smells amazing, but it does have somewhat of a cough syrup scent before it really settles into your skin. However, in spite of that one little con, it is a very pretty, yummy fragrance. I am a bonafide perfume addict, and know something good when I smell it. I do prefer sweeter scents over musky fragrances (especially during the warmer seasons), so I may be a little partial in this review due to that preference. But this really is a lovely perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick tip: Layering a scent like this with a sweet, but mild body butter or lotion when you are fresh out of the shower helps the scent last longer. Spray your pulse points and it is guaranteed to last all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this at BGBG store and loved it ever since so when i ran out i wondered where i could get it and here it was.&lt;br /&gt;Very feminine soft and floral sweet scent! Smells lovely after it drys out too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled this product when it first came out and been addictive every since.&lt;br /&gt;Love this smell - I&#x27;ve love all the latest smells by BCBG</li>
            <li> I love the smell although it does not last all day! It has a light aroma that does not overwhelm you.</li>
            <li> It smelled amazing! I love it! Everyday use (:  I have everybody at my job asking me which perfume I use (:</li>
            <li> I received it on time, not sure how it is cause i bought it as a gift but i would recommend to someone else</li>
            <li> I love BCBG MAX Azria perfume. I originally bought at Macy&#x27;s for over $70 to wear on my wedding day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received so many compliments and I&#x27;m delighted to have found it on Amazon for a fraction of the cost at dept. stores. Can&#x27;t wait to receive it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SIZE VERY BIG. AND FRAGANCE OMG, SUCH LIKE IT HEAVEN. ITS VERY SWEET.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on how great this smells! I was relatively surprised since it&#x27;s at such a discount! The bottle is so beautiful as well!</li>
            <li> Love this scent by BCBG.  I love BCBG anyway, but I had been given this sample at a department store and just fell in love with it.  It&#x27;s got the vanilla and sandalwood base to it, which I&#x27;m a sucker for anyway.  It&#x27;s a lighter scent, but I really think it can be worn all year.  This is the one I picked to wear at my wedding &amp; I thought it fit the occasion.  My maid of honor wore &amp;#34;Bon Chic&amp;#34; which is the same bottle, but a tan color.  That scent is definitely heavier, but still excellent.  I recommend either one of them!</li>
            <li> Smells okay. Kind of chemically :/</li>
            <li> Pretty bottle with a large amount of parfum (perfume).  I love this scent - it&#x27;s somewhere between sweet and spicey.  It&#x27;s a great value for a nice perfume, you get a  large bottle, 3.4 ounces, for a reasonable price.  The top looks like a large pink flower when you see it from the top.  When I want just a soft scent, I spray some in water and then rub the scented water on my arms.  It softens the scent if I&#x27;m going to be with a crowd in close quarters.  It&#x27;s a really pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> got one for me and one for my mother the bottle is beautiful and the smell is light flowery and last all day not overpowering very modern smell.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really and isn&#x27;t too strong. I thought I was just ordering the large bottle of perfume, but actually received the entire gift set. It included a large bottle of perfume, small bottle of perfume, body wash, and lotion. It was a great deal!!</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews and with the key notes of the fragrance itself was a great buying factor in my purchase. This is a very lovely scent. My nieces love this so much I had to hide the bottle so they wouldn&#x27;t spray it all over them. Looking forward to purchasing more scents from this line.</li>
            <li> You know you&#x27;ve bought the right one when you love it and you get compliments on it like I did! Just make sure you try a sample at the store first</li>
            <li> A gift to my wife. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Great price!</li>
            <li> The person that this gift was for really enjoys it. She was very excited to receive this product for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Smells so good!!  Was walking through a department store and was enthralled by this amazing scent.  Actually followed my nose till I found it!  You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not all that and it does smell a little bit like cough syrup when you spray it at first.</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet like a candy floral-ish scent. While I like the smell, the smell doesn&#x27;t last at all, so that&#x27;s a disappointment. The bottle is very beautiful though.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume and I purchased it based on the reviews not knowing the actual scent. It&#x27;s very nice. Smells like cherries and lime combined. It&#x27;s lasting power ranges from three to four hours depending on how much you sprayed on yourself. It&#x27;s light and fresh. It&#x27;s an easy fragrance to wear everyday and is even nice for a night out to dinner (especially if you don&#x27;t want to suffocate everybody around you).</li>
            <li> a very naci shirt, i recomended 100% excelent quality, confort a good price, excelent product, my wife love it say no more</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FAKE VERSION FOR SURE. WHEN I SPRAY THE ONE I BOUGHT OFF THIS SITE, IT HAS AN ALCOHOL SCENT AND DOESNT HAVE THE POTENCY OF THE REAL STUFF. BUYER BEWARE!!!!! THIS IS NOT REAL!!!!!! ITS CHEAP. BUT I HAVE THE ORIGINAL BOTTLE AND THE LETTERING IS WRONG AND THE STICKER ON THE BOTTOM IS DIFFERENT. GOOD FOR CHEAP PERFUME, I GUESS.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the Misses! She Loves it!</li>
            <li> I always buy  parfums hoping to get comments on how great I smell...doesn&#x27;t everyone?  I like this okay, but it is a little over powering for me.  If I put on what I would normally put on it overwhelms, if I put on less I really don&#x27;t notice it. I gave it to my daughter and it smells amazing on her...Chemestry!</li>
            <li> arrived on time.  great price.  glad I found them</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed about the quality of the product. The backs were supposed to be screw on and I almost lost and earring. The screw on back for one of the earrings fell off. It does not screw on. I would like to get a replacement pair.</li>
            <li> I feel sexy when I wear this fragrance. It is sweet and flowery, yet subtle. It is in no way overbearing and lasts throughout the day. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful, the scent is very pretty and the price is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Garbage watered down fake. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Perfume came 2 days earlier and it is the real deal!</li>
            <li> This perfume is not authentic. Doesn&#x27;t even have the same sticker on the bottom or same distributor as the authentic BCBG perfume does</li>
            <li> SMELL PRETTY GOOD BUT THE SMELL DOES NOT LAST LONG</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this. Its nice and light</li>
            <li> If you like One Direction Our Moment you will love this, trust me! It is sweet and soft yet sensual. Great fragrance for winter and I think you could also wear it in the summer time. Amazon also had the best price for it. Sooooo excited to get it! :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SENT AND THE PRICE IS AFFORDABLE.  THANKS SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Correct size arrived and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is my wife favorite perfume!!!! 3rd bottle</li>
            <li> Exellent! This is my 4th time ordering!!</li>
            <li> It smells just as good as I remember. The scent however, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Love the scent! My new favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> Probably wouldve loved this fragrance... I never got the right item. They sent me a men&#x27;s cologne and after trying to send it back for replacement... Address was bad and they sent it back. I gave up... I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the company selling this product anymore.</li>
            <li> This fragance is very light and airy.  It tends to blends in with your chemistry and enhances it.  I have sinus issues and, at times, I will forget that I have this fragance on which is a good thing.  You can go on the heavy side with this fragance and yet it still doesn&#x27;t overtake you as some fragances will and yet will be more defining - it&#x27;s really your choice.  This is an excellent everyday scent.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo GOOD!! My new fav perfume!</li>
            <li> Smells a lot like Flower Bomb!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy! Cheap too. WINNING</li>
            <li> I receive this with a lot of expectation because always bcbg perfums are strong and smell from far. This bottle is pretty but doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;smell at all, obvious didn&#x27;t last and will try to return.</li>
            <li> My favorite is BCBG Max Azria Bon Chic, but I absolutely Love this one too!</li>
            <li> Great smelling perfume but the scent only last about 1-2 hours would not recommend, but LOVE the scent. Maybe it is just me.</li>
            <li> I like the perfume but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would when you spray it on. That is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> looks great and smells greaat</li>
            <li> It arrived early than I expected. It&#x27;s cheaper than from the stores and its a big bottle. I like the sweet light smell of it. But it doesn&#x27;t last long. But over all I gave it a 4 stars. Im happy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this scent, and apparently so do males.  It&#x27;s sweet and sexy, but not heavy or overbearing.  I get compliments from males all the time that I &amp;#34;smell sooo good&amp;#34;.  I recently recommended to a friend and she got the same results.  She said even her husband, who rarely gives her compliments, made a comment about it.  Amazon saves me about $35 on the 3.4oz bottle as opposed to buying in the dept store and it lasts forever!  Definitely my favorite perfume right now!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite everyday perfumes.  I wear this during the work week instead of my expensive perfumes.  The scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough. First, (and maybe only women feel this way about BCBG or any designer&#x27;s packaging) you are already excited when you see the box and open it to find the beautiful bottle top which looks like a pink flower and is made of a sturdy plastic that is flexible so not easily broken. The fragrance is beautiful. It is not too deep a flowery scent, but there are deep undertones that are very pleasant. It is just right. I will not say it lasts from 7 a.m. to evening, but I also did not use a lot as have not gone out anywhere special since just receiving it. A beautiful fragrance exactly as you would expect from Max Azria. Thank you Amazon because were it not for your price I would not have chosen this as part of my birthday gift card!!!  The price was absolutely amazing for 3.4 oz Eau De Parfum.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It is okay, not the best.</li>
            <li> Very affordable...I&#x27;ve never bought  perfumes online, smells amazing,fresh,clean I had a lot of compliments about my new fragrance! And got a coupon for my next purchase! Awesome!</li>
            <li> i bought this perfume for my daughter michele as i did for my other daughter elisa also for a passover gift.  i was in her house when she opened it and she sprayed her wrist with it.  it was a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, and it smells really good. Kind of a fruity, sweet smell that sticks to her very well. She adores it, and I&#x27;m happy because Amazon always seems to have a much better deal on this than department stores.</li>
            <li> Good perfume that has a long lasting smell. I would recommend it to any lady.</li>
            <li> I am no perfume expert.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife.  The first time she wore this perfume I was just rising from a nights sleep while she got ready for work.  The fragrance shocked me into a good mood, just like that, and I am not a morning person.  What a delight this aroma is!  I figure I just got lucky when I selected this product.  I plan on replacing it when it runs out.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> i like it .. its a very nice fruity girly sent ..&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t really last long maybe 4-5 hours ..&lt;br /&gt;overall its a pretty sent !</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. great buy</li>
            <li> This is such a lovely perfume from the container to the scent it&#x27;s perfect. Can be used day or evening. I loved it and I will keep using this for a while &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great fragrance. Bought it for Christmas for my sister, and she liked it. Great price for it, too!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume. She has been wearing it for over a year now. I was looking to buy her some more for Christmas before her other ran out. Found this on here and the price is way lower than the over priced department store. You cannot beat these prices for this perfume and I love the smell of it on her. Cant wait for her to open it up.</li>
            <li> I love perfume and I saw this bottle I had never seen or heard of this one before for the sheer look of the bottle and the top pink and beautifully designed it looks great and it have a lovely sent. yes I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> excelent, very nice perfums, softly and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;like so much.......&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this perfum,&lt;br /&gt;I hope that u like it</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells a lot different than the sample I received in the retail store.  I was a little disappointed and would not buy it again.  Bu the bottle is very pretty.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to buy this for 2 years just wasn&#x27;t sure but ladies it has a softsmell and yet fruity best investment ever!</li>
            <li> I found this at TJ Maxx, 1.7oz bottle for $8, so I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I&#x27;m not normally a fan of fruity scents but this one is wearable. The top notes are a bit much, but after a while it settles down nicely. This smells like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret type perfume; a scent for someone young, maybe even high school. I do not regret buying it, but would not repurchase since it kind of smells like fruit juice :\  But did I mention the bottle is GORGEOUS!?</li>
            <li> I already knew what this parfum smelled like, so I am very pleased with my purchase. It smells absolutely lovely and I will purchase again. My husband is very picky about what I wear and this is one even he approves of.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this fragrance! I needed some more, but didn&#x27;t want to pay department store prices. So happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and I have always received compliments when I wear it.  My husband likes it as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it! I have been a one-perfume woman for at least 15 years. I would ONLY wear Eternity since 1995 because I hated everything else...too strong, too heavy, too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;, too heavy, too light, too nasty, putrid, smelled like an old lady, smelled like a cheap whore, or too heavy and could smell a mile away, or they smelled like everything else, or just plain stinky. Then my cousin got this for Christmas and I ACTUALLY liked it! She let me have a spritz and half an hour later I liked it even better! Everyone was shocked that I actually liked it. So I bought my own and have been wearing it every day. My husband noticed and let&#x27;s just say I got more kisses &amp; cuddles that day. I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments. It&#x27;s light, airy, pretty, sexy, and not &amp;#34;overdone&amp;#34;. This perfume just won me over after 15+ years of Eternity. I&#x27;m VERY picky with perfumes and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Love it and would recommend to other women..great smell and lasts all day. Great price and a bargain over getting it at the malls</li>
            <li> My girlfriend specifically requested this perfume for Christmas. I don&#x27;t like the smell of many perfumes, but this one is ok in my book. Most importantly, my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Got this item delivered before expected time which was nice, I sprayed it on me and within an hour the smell it&#x27;s gone, nice flower smell, it just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I came across this perfume in a magazine and I thought it smelled so good that I wanted it as a Christmas gift, made sure the hubby knew as I showed him the magazine sample, he thought it smelled nice but worried it would be over powering as his nose can be sensitive to most perfumes. I guess my perfume choices work well for him, he loves this fragrance on me. I love putting it on as I am getting ready for the day, makes me feel endearingly sweet, sexy, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Ordered and received within a couple of days , exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> good product, fast service,perfect gift for your Lady.first time to order this product, my wife loves the beautiful bottle.next order soon.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and this price was so much cheaper than it was at all other stores! My absolute favorite and the smell lasts all day :) i love smelling myself and so does my husband! This is a big attraction ;)</li>
            <li> I went to the mall and smelled this perfume, i sprayed it and walked around for a good 2 hours shopping, eating etc. the scent had very nice durability then.  Unfortunately when i received it through Amazon did not lasts as long as the one at the mall did.  It smells the same the only thing is that the scent fades away quickly.  Aveces lo barato sale caro . Nimodo :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very pretty BTW.  I would say somewhat like fruity ;)</li>
            <li> Nice and very pretty bottle for display.  The parfum has a very light sweet smell.  Did not last long on my skin but decided to pass on to my neice and stays on her with no problem.  She is enjoying it very much</li>
            <li> The perfume from department stores in bright pink, but this one was so watered down it was a pale yellow. It had no potency and didn&#x27;t smell like the real thing either. Total garbage. And worse part is Amazon will not let you return it because they labeled it &amp;#34;Hazardous goods&amp;#34;. Total waste of $$$$$.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great!  The only reason I gave it a 4 out 5 stars is because it&#x27;s a bit pricey and the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance. the one i ordered from amazon never arrived</li>
            <li> smelly like a pretty fower</li>
