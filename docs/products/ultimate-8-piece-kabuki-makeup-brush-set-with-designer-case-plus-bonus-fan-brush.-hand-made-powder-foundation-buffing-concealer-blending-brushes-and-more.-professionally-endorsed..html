            <li>crystal handles are such a beautiful touch, It definitely adds a touch of elegance.</li>
            <li>I love the dense fan brush for highlighting and bronzer but it does take a little more time to blend.</li>
            <li>clear handles are easy to hold -</li>
            <li>and when I got around to using them I was surprised that they worked just as good as my $50+ dollar individual brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft but smelled slightly strong out of the box (unnoticeable as I used them) and the blush brush is shedding a bit (though I&#x27;ve never had a blush brush that hasn&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li>I use them every single day and i can tell they are amazing</li>
            <li>It came in the very next day I ordered it and when I opened it I was greeted by a very nice looking white leather like material box.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and just as advertised!</li>
            <li>It is the correct size in terms of largeness and is very VERY dense all the way through.</li>
            <li>These are top of the line high quality professional brushes.</li>
            <li>The entire set screams of High Quality starting from the case, which is both, beautiful and practical.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip: Gently wash the brushes that you use after each use using a gentle soap or cleaning solution specially designed for makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I love all the different shapes included for any purpose you can come up with...</li>
            <li>If you have the original 8 piece add this one to complete your brush concert!</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re not &amp;#34;just a pretty face&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>, Beautifully!!&lt;br /&gt;A note for anyone interested:  </li>
            <li>I would love to couple this set with a set of smaller detail brushes: eyebrow, lip, smudge, and eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>so I was able to use them for my face and my eyes, with the smaller brushes of course.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As for me, I&#x27;d order ten more if I could, just to gaze at.</li>
            <li>They are individually wrapped and don&#x27;t have a chemical smell that most synthetic brushes have.</li>
            <li>I used them for the first time on a trip to Vegas</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter fell in love with it too, therefore, I had no choice but to buy her a set for herself</li>
            <li>I love all the different shapes included for any purpose you can come up with...</li>
            <li>If you have the original 8 piece add this one to complete your brush concert!</li>
            <li>Flat top, detail, pointed, angled...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own any other ones to compare</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re just as soft, fluffy, full and good quality as they were here in the video.</li>
            <li>Flat top, detail, pointed, angled...</li>
            <li>A large powder brush, stippling brush, a bonus denser flat top kabuki,and eye set in the crystal edition</li>
            <li>Love the style its so modern and down right pretty!</li>
            <li>was able to do my whole makeup application with these synthetic brushes although I wish they would have included in this set a flat eyeshadow brush but regardless these brushes are multi purpose</li>
            <li>; - this is a smart choice.</li>
            <li>The two sets together will largely be all the brushes you will ever need and they come with a lifetime guarantee.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing that I&#x27;ll say about this fan brush is that it does have a great amount of synthetic fibers for highlighting application, BUT, it wouldn&#x27;t deliver as well-due to the uneven cut of the ferrel.</li>
            <li>The professional make up tutorials by Allison, who I hear was trained at a very highly rated school in LA, was informative and fun to the MAX.</li>
            <li>The professional make up tutorials by Allison, who I hear was trained at a very highly rated school in LA, was informative and fun to the MAX.</li>
            <li>The brushes were well protected by the case that came with it and the case itself looks very elegant and sturdy (altho not really sure if it&#x27;s real leather).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t scratch your face because of the gentle synthetic quality they use for the brushes which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the reviews made me buy this set.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s so much for ONE WASH</li>
            <li>I feel like I spent way more than I did.  </li>
            <li>These brushes appear to be very well made and are a dream to use.  </li>
            <li>and i really like them.</li>
            <li>The set arrived surprisingly fast.</li>
            <li>and these are very sturdy brushes .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used these brushes with cream, liquid, and powder products and they worked really well.</li>
            <li>but I really recommend the whole set)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>These brushes wash easily and dry quickly, unlike other brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased, and the larger brushes come with their own netting to help keep the brushes maintain shape.</li>
            <li>Extremely dense, fluffy, SO soft and application is flawless.</li>
            <li>Got these today and they are better than I would&#x27;ve ever expected!</li>
            <li>and I wish I had found these before I dropped lots and lots of $$$ on experimenting with so many other kinds.</li>
            <li>I will make an update review after a month (of using and cleaning) to see if they will hold up to non-shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After more than a month of using and regular once a week cleaning, I have noticed some minor shedding right after washing (maybe a couple of bristles).</li>
            <li>The brushes are dense enough to pick up the product but not too dense where it takes forever to clean.</li>
            <li>I still keep the mesh net over each brush after I clean them so</li>
            <li>These brushes made the application process easier and the makeup blended better, in addition the makeup lasted a LONG time probably because the application was much better than usual.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and dense and don&#x27;t shed, exactly what was described and what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I ordered the brushes back in May and having been using them everyday, washing the brushes every week and making sure they are thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the fact that the handles were clear but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.</li>
            <li>oh so soft deluxe pro fluffy Fan</li>
            <li>These brushes do not shed and they come with properly fitted brush guards to keep them safe in their case and keep their shape while drying, I have never had brushes come with actual brush guards</li>
            <li>Why use the fan brush as the main star of this kit to lure customers?</li>
            <li>They are too thin, too tiny or wayy too large, thicker but not dense enough however this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>all very soft and dense!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this make up brush kit to all.</li>
            <li>These are a high quality set of brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and dense, feels very sturdy and well made, so there’s a good chance it’ll last through heavy usage.</li>
            <li>Makes you feel like you are at a high end boutique</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone to invest on any of the Be</li>
            <li>High quality with pride in craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>The handles are very sturdy and you can&#x27;t see glue like other cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>You have a brush for each of those and more with this set.&lt;br /&gt;The magnetized box neatly conceals the brushes, so you can&#x27;t tell there are 9 brushes hiding in that neat little container.</li>
            <li>Need a little more finishing powder?</li>
            <li>Soft brissels that don&#x27;t fall out and stab your face!!</li>
            <li>Need a little more finishing powder?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for about a week, and so far not so much as a stray bristle.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are very well crafted and so soft.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical when I first bought this, but I decided to after reading the fairly good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>because so much of my professional practice as a cosmotologyist is about diversity I come across so many different shapes and sizes with different things I want to emphasize.</li>
            <li>But overall, I consider them well worth it.</li>
            <li>because so much of my professional practice as a cosmotologyist is about diversity I come across so many different shapes and sizes with different things I want to emphasize.</li>
            <li>The main element that spiked my interest in this set, were the clear handles and satin gold accents!</li>
            <li>Rock solid leather and opens in the middle and is held together by a strong magnet.</li>
            <li>The flat top kabuki doesn&#x27;t have enough stiffness, as it doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough hair as the Sigma F80 as well, so I can only imagine that applying foundation will only take more time.</li>
            <li>Take care of them and you will not have to buy new brushes ever again.</li>
            <li>I was 2 seconds away from buying new ones at Ulta when my friend recommended me to purchase them oline instead.</li>
            <li>VERY professional.</li>
            <li>I feel I look very natural.</li>
            <li>These are high end professional makeup brushes</li>
            <li>VERY professional.</li>
            <li>The brushes are sturdy and bristles are soft!</li>

            <li>I only wish they had a separate set of additional eye brushes because I don&#x27;t want to buy more fave brained to get the other eye brushes this company makes.</li>
            <li>I actually ordered these because I thought they would be pretty on my makeup table.....</li>

            <li>So soft and pretty but eye brushes are too big</li>
            <li>You, Beautifully Brushes Sets I confidently assure you that you will not be disappointed -  no need to spend exuberant amounts of money for other sets when this one is both, affordable and well made.  </li>
            <li>This is the only usable fan brush I&#x27;ve ever bought as so many fan brushes have so little thought put into them.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I wish the eye brushes were smaller for better precison because I have such petite facial features.</li>
            <li>this is such a reasonable price for the quality of brushes (coming from someone who makes a living off</li>
            <li>It looked fancy and professional.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>I have been working professionally in the beauty industry for over 15 years.</li>
            <li>oh so soft brushes.</li>

            <li>Their sooo soft &amp; I would recommend beginners like me to buy these ❤️</li>
            <li>getting your face done professionally.</li>
            <li>and after being completely blown away by that</li>
            <li>I have been working professionally in the beauty industry for over 15 years.</li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing a set of brushes from this company, and I must say that they have really outdone themselves.</li>
            <li>i just cant get over the classy look of the brushes- crystal..</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and plush.</li>
            <li>Professional-</li>
            <li>The brushes are dense and firm specially designed for the professional makeup artists or aficionados like myself.  </li>
            <li>This new set utterly completes me as an equipped artist for any situation.</li>
            <li>This new set utterly completes me as an equipped artist for any situation.</li>
            <li>The other brushes are okay, but given the few faulty brushes, this kit doesn&#x27;t even deserve a shrug and a &amp;#34;meh, it&#x27;s alright.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are so soft, and when I put my make up on there was such a difference from the brushes I used.</li>
            <li>This review will echo much of what I said in my other review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little too much couture needing smoothing?</li>

            <li> The packaging from inside out was great, very pretty to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> The two halves of this box are held together by a pretty strong magnet and over all was impressed with the packaging.</li>
            <li> I affixed text stickers to them and covered with a clear coat to note which brush was the best for contouring, concealer, etc.</li>
            <li> I find myself comparing them to my IT Cosmetic brushes, they are so soft and do great when picking up and applying products!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used many high quality brand brushes and these can compare or even pass them up!</li>
            <li> The 4 different options to work with eye application (or for the creative artist that subs one for concealer application) are perfect for all the smokey eyes and simple daily ideas I love to try out.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great set for any extra shadowing or contouring which we all know is very &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; at the moment :) Definitely highly recommending this product get it while it&#x27;s on sale</li>
            <li> The crystal handles are long and sleek with gorgeous  designs.</li>
            <li> I  love everything about this brushes and it is very soft</li>
            <li> It is worth the buy and are very pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> Most brushes make my sensitive skin itchy - not these!  </li>
            <li> box is so adorable and the brushes are dense and super soft  .</li>
            <li> but i think people like me really should try,  so classy and amazing quality</li>
            <li> I love the clear handles.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am not employed by Be You Beautifully (no financial interest), nor did I receive any free or discounted product :-)</li>
            <li> They were so worth the price.</li>

            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It is more lush than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> The bristles have a very luxurious feel and the brushes are heavy, but nicely weighted, so very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The very first brush set I ever bought fell apart on me on the first wash</li>
            <li> , I live that the brushes are so soft and I love that it came with a variety!</li>
            <li> Will serve you right if they r sold out or u blink one time</li>

            <li> Back to the Kabuki Set:  I am so so excited to now be reviewing my new favorite Crystal Kabuki Brush set!</li>
            <li> I would send any artist or young teen learning tricks to her videos for amazing tips!</li>
            <li> I would send any artist or young teen learning tricks to her videos for amazing tips!</li>
            <li> Actually, more like love at average consumer review rates.</li>
            <li> crystal handles are such a beautiful touch, It definitely adds a touch of elegance.</li>
            <li> I love the dense fan brush for highlighting and bronzer but it does take a little more time to blend.</li>
            <li> clear handles are easy to hold -</li>
            <li> and when I got around to using them I was surprised that they worked just as good as my $50+ dollar individual brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft but smelled slightly strong out of the box (unnoticeable as I used them) and the blush brush is shedding a bit (though I&#x27;ve never had a blush brush that hasn&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> I use them every single day and i can tell they are amazing</li>
            <li> It came in the very next day I ordered it and when I opened it I was greeted by a very nice looking white leather like material box.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and just as advertised!</li>
            <li> It is the correct size in terms of largeness and is very VERY dense all the way through.</li>
            <li> These are top of the line high quality professional brushes.</li>
            <li> The entire set screams of High Quality starting from the case, which is both, beautiful and practical.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: Gently wash the brushes that you use after each use using a gentle soap or cleaning solution specially designed for makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I love all the different shapes included for any purpose you can come up with...</li>
            <li> If you have the original 8 piece add this one to complete your brush concert!</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re not &amp;#34;just a pretty face&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> , Beautifully!!&lt;br /&gt;A note for anyone interested:  </li>
            <li> I would love to couple this set with a set of smaller detail brushes: eyebrow, lip, smudge, and eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> so I was able to use them for my face and my eyes, with the smaller brushes of course.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As for me, I&#x27;d order ten more if I could, just to gaze at.</li>
            <li> They are individually wrapped and don&#x27;t have a chemical smell that most synthetic brushes have.</li>
            <li> I used them for the first time on a trip to Vegas</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter fell in love with it too, therefore, I had no choice but to buy her a set for herself</li>
            <li> I love all the different shapes included for any purpose you can come up with...</li>
            <li> If you have the original 8 piece add this one to complete your brush concert!</li>
            <li> Flat top, detail, pointed, angled...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own any other ones to compare</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re just as soft, fluffy, full and good quality as they were here in the video.</li>
            <li> Flat top, detail, pointed, angled...</li>
            <li> A large powder brush, stippling brush, a bonus denser flat top kabuki,and eye set in the crystal edition</li>
            <li> Love the style its so modern and down right pretty!</li>
            <li> was able to do my whole makeup application with these synthetic brushes although I wish they would have included in this set a flat eyeshadow brush but regardless these brushes are multi purpose</li>
            <li> ; - this is a smart choice.</li>
            <li> The two sets together will largely be all the brushes you will ever need and they come with a lifetime guarantee.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing that I&#x27;ll say about this fan brush is that it does have a great amount of synthetic fibers for highlighting application, BUT, it wouldn&#x27;t deliver as well-due to the uneven cut of the ferrel.</li>
            <li> The professional make up tutorials by Allison, who I hear was trained at a very highly rated school in LA, was informative and fun to the MAX.</li>
            <li> The professional make up tutorials by Allison, who I hear was trained at a very highly rated school in LA, was informative and fun to the MAX.</li>
            <li> The brushes were well protected by the case that came with it and the case itself looks very elegant and sturdy (altho not really sure if it&#x27;s real leather).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t scratch your face because of the gentle synthetic quality they use for the brushes which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the reviews made me buy this set.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s so much for ONE WASH</li>
            <li> I feel like I spent way more than I did.  </li>
            <li> These brushes appear to be very well made and are a dream to use.  </li>
            <li> and i really like them.</li>
            <li> The set arrived surprisingly fast.</li>
            <li> and these are very sturdy brushes .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used these brushes with cream, liquid, and powder products and they worked really well.</li>
            <li> but I really recommend the whole set)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> These brushes wash easily and dry quickly, unlike other brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased, and the larger brushes come with their own netting to help keep the brushes maintain shape.</li>
            <li> Extremely dense, fluffy, SO soft and application is flawless.</li>
            <li> Got these today and they are better than I would&#x27;ve ever expected!</li>
            <li> and I wish I had found these before I dropped lots and lots of $$$ on experimenting with so many other kinds.</li>
            <li> I will make an update review after a month (of using and cleaning) to see if they will hold up to non-shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After more than a month of using and regular once a week cleaning, I have noticed some minor shedding right after washing (maybe a couple of bristles).</li>
            <li> The brushes are dense enough to pick up the product but not too dense where it takes forever to clean.</li>
            <li> I still keep the mesh net over each brush after I clean them so</li>
            <li> These brushes made the application process easier and the makeup blended better, in addition the makeup lasted a LONG time probably because the application was much better than usual.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and dense and don&#x27;t shed, exactly what was described and what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I ordered the brushes back in May and having been using them everyday, washing the brushes every week and making sure they are thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the fact that the handles were clear but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.</li>
            <li> oh so soft deluxe pro fluffy Fan</li>
            <li> These brushes do not shed and they come with properly fitted brush guards to keep them safe in their case and keep their shape while drying, I have never had brushes come with actual brush guards</li>
            <li> Why use the fan brush as the main star of this kit to lure customers?</li>
            <li> They are too thin, too tiny or wayy too large, thicker but not dense enough however this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> all very soft and dense!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this make up brush kit to all.</li>
            <li> These are a high quality set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and dense, feels very sturdy and well made, so there’s a good chance it’ll last through heavy usage.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel like you are at a high end boutique</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone to invest on any of the Be</li>
            <li> High quality with pride in craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> The handles are very sturdy and you can&#x27;t see glue like other cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> You have a brush for each of those and more with this set.&lt;br /&gt;The magnetized box neatly conceals the brushes, so you can&#x27;t tell there are 9 brushes hiding in that neat little container.</li>
            <li> Need a little more finishing powder?</li>
            <li> Soft brissels that don&#x27;t fall out and stab your face!!</li>
            <li> Need a little more finishing powder?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for about a week, and so far not so much as a stray bristle.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are very well crafted and so soft.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first bought this, but I decided to after reading the fairly good reviews about it.</li>
            <li> because so much of my professional practice as a cosmotologyist is about diversity I come across so many different shapes and sizes with different things I want to emphasize.</li>
            <li> But overall, I consider them well worth it.</li>
            <li> because so much of my professional practice as a cosmotologyist is about diversity I come across so many different shapes and sizes with different things I want to emphasize.</li>
            <li> The main element that spiked my interest in this set, were the clear handles and satin gold accents!</li>
            <li> Rock solid leather and opens in the middle and is held together by a strong magnet.</li>
            <li> The flat top kabuki doesn&#x27;t have enough stiffness, as it doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough hair as the Sigma F80 as well, so I can only imagine that applying foundation will only take more time.</li>
            <li> Take care of them and you will not have to buy new brushes ever again.</li>
            <li> I was 2 seconds away from buying new ones at Ulta when my friend recommended me to purchase them oline instead.</li>
            <li> VERY professional.</li>
            <li> I feel I look very natural.</li>
            <li> These are high end professional makeup brushes</li>
            <li> VERY professional.</li>

            <li> You, Beautifully Brushes Sets I confidently assure you that you will not be disappointed -  no need to spend exuberant amounts of money for other sets when this one is both, affordable and well made.  </li>
            <li> This is the only usable fan brush I&#x27;ve ever bought as so many fan brushes have so little thought put into them.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I wish the eye brushes were smaller for better precison because I have such petite facial features.</li>
            <li> this is such a reasonable price for the quality of brushes (coming from someone who makes a living off</li>
            <li> It looked fancy and professional.</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> I have been working professionally in the beauty industry for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> oh so soft brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles were soft and dense.</li>
            <li> Their sooo soft &amp; I would recommend beginners like me to buy these ❤️</li>
            <li> getting your face done professionally.</li>
            <li> and after being completely blown away by that</li>
            <li> I have been working professionally in the beauty industry for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing a set of brushes from this company, and I must say that they have really outdone themselves.</li>
            <li> i just cant get over the classy look of the brushes- crystal..</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and plush.</li>
            <li> Professional-</li>
            <li> The brushes are dense and firm specially designed for the professional makeup artists or aficionados like myself.  </li>
            <li> This new set utterly completes me as an equipped artist for any situation.</li>
            <li> This new set utterly completes me as an equipped artist for any situation.</li>
            <li> The other brushes are okay, but given the few faulty brushes, this kit doesn&#x27;t even deserve a shrug and a &amp;#34;meh, it&#x27;s alright.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are so soft, and when I put my make up on there was such a difference from the brushes I used.</li>
            <li> This review will echo much of what I said in my other review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little too much couture needing smoothing?</li>
            <li> A little too much couture needing smoothing?</li>
            <li> : ive washed these brushes several times so far and had very minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> The quality control is surely lacking, the ferrule of my fan brush is cut out very awkwardly, so it doesn&#x27;t fan out evenly; I didn&#x27;t notice this until after I cleansed the brush after taking it out when I first received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> have 2 pricey professional kabuki brushes (other brand) and... there.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave these brushes four stars is because if you wring the brush after cleaning too hard, the bristles will fall out the first time.</li>
            <li> i usually dont write reviews since i dont have much time</li>
            <li> Never would I have imagined that I would be having an affair on Shiseido Flat Kabuki Foundation Brush with another Flat Kabuki, yet I am</li>
            <li> The tapered kabuki brush is not fun to clean either: it doesn&#x27;t rinse well when it comes to cleaning (I&#x27;ve tried rinsing my Philosophy purity cleanser off of it for at least 4 times now), which I just gave up on it.</li>
            <li> case is the same that came with the other set although in white.</li>
            <li> Instead I spent hundreds of dollars on buying individual brushes from places like MAC and Sephora.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using these brushes for a very long time.</li>
            <li> and so far, no shedding, (which is what I fear and hate most on makeup brushes).</li>
            <li> I actually used less of my mineral makeup because the brushes don&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The only reason why I am rating them 3 out of 5 is because after a wash the hair starts to come out few like 2-3 hair</li>
            <li> and I have purchased a wide range of make up brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also feel like my makeup skills are definitely lacking and not worthy of these brushes!</li>
            <li> i am going to buy a travel set to take with me on trips and get rid of all the other brushes I have.</li>
            <li> Just like the other brushes I reviewed, the Be You, Chic Core Collection is the highest quality collection of brushes I have ever used.</li>
            <li> i have thrown away all other brushes I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> other makeup brush set (http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ICYS0COOVYP5/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00KVOFOCY&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760911&amp;store&#x3D;beauty)</li>
            <li> I knew I had to buy their other set.</li>
            <li> It will preserve the brushes, prevent spread of bacteria, and prevent them from eventually shedding due to not being cared for properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since reviewing the brushes I&#x27;ve been using them every other day</li>
            <li> /&gt;There were carefully examined up and down and tested in use.</li>
            <li> try to be careful with goods, that happen to cost less than I like to think they should cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thick handles, correct length, rock solid ferrules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have two toned tips of grey and black which sets the beauty off!!</li>
            <li> I run the fan brush down his nose</li>
            <li> I agree with all of the previous reviewed that they make me want to upgrade the makeup I use.</li>
            <li> These brushes have literally cut my makeup routine in half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bent in such a ridiculous way, so I wouldn&#x27;t bother using it-was hoping to use it for highlighting.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush set for a little over 2+ months</li>
            <li> The brushes are a little heavy in weight but nothing you can&#x27;t bear.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment, is that there are not smaller brushes included in this design.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to damage the brushes and I have to be extra careful when doing so, but that is probably just me.</li>
            <li> Thank God no more digging through bags anymore.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these brushes over any of the brushes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> how her face looks trust me it can be hard to find even one blush brush under $40)</li>
            <li> Plus I knew that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about my brushes being ruined while I travel since I don&#x27;t carry them in a hard case.</li>
            <li> once I received these brushes - no more gunky drugstore brands, these brushes needed quality material to work with!</li>
            <li> I was sick and tired of those nasty harsh strokes on my face due to cheap quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed ): ONLY one wash .</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the packaging is a tad annoying when I am closing it.</li>
            <li> you were wrong.</li>
            <li> For price like this, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a brush set before and wanted one but couldn&#x27;t afford anything expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel guilty!</li>
            <li> Even the boyfriend paused his video game to gaze at these soon as they popped out the box!!!</li>
            <li> You and your bridal clients, actors, models, and family will not be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am obcessed with these make-up brushes! They are very soft and made with great quality.  I only lost one hair after washing them initially. I am very pleased with how my make-up applies using them, making me truely feel beautiful. The only thing is that I wish the eye brushes were smaller for better precison because I have such petite facial features. Candy, the founder of Be You, Beautifully is awesome!!! She stands by her products 100% and will do whatever it takes to make you happy. I promise you will be satisfied with your purchase. I plan to continue using these brushes for a very long time. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I loved loved my new  Crystal Kabuki brush set, it super soft, amazingly magic!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh!! Got these today and they are better than I would&#x27;ve ever expected! The brushes are sturdy and bristles are soft! I actually used less of my mineral makeup because the brushes don&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; my product! Haven&#x27;t cleaned them yet, but awesome!!! And the brush holder is beautiful!</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I agree with all of the previous reviewed that they make me want to upgrade the makeup I use. I also feel like my makeup skills are definitely lacking and not worthy of these brushes! The quality of the brushes is much greater than the cost would suggest!</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s are fighting me for this! Nope not happening! These are mine and I love the Magnetic box, I live that the brushes are so soft and I love that it came with a variety! My new brushes are amazing!!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Thank God no more digging through bags anymore. The organizer has a magnetic top so all brushes are kept clean and not exposed. The brushes themselves are so soft, and when I put my make up on there was such a difference from the brushes I used. These are top of the line high quality professional brushes. I love the clear handles. I highly recommend this make up brush kit to all. Do not miss out on this opportunity to purchase professional brushes at a great super price</li>
            <li> Warning: These brushes will make you want to buy fancier makeup.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are dense, soft, gentle and magnificent at blending both powders and creams. The different style of brushes ensure you have the proper tool for whatever type of makeup you are using - foundation? Concealer? Eyeshadow? Contouring? You have a brush for each of those and more with this set.&lt;br /&gt;The magnetized box neatly conceals the brushes, so you can&#x27;t tell there are 9 brushes hiding in that neat little container. These brushes wash easily and dry quickly, unlike other brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased, and the larger brushes come with their own netting to help keep the brushes maintain shape. I have been using these brushes for three weeks now and have yet to see a shed hair.&lt;br /&gt;The clear handles are easy to hold - I affixed text stickers to them and covered with a clear coat to note which brush was the best for contouring, concealer, etc. That made them even easier to grab and use in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;The only warning I can give is that I *had* to go out and purchase nicer powder and foundation once I received these brushes - no more gunky drugstore brands, these brushes needed quality material to work with!</li>
            <li> I  love everything about this brushes and it is very soft i love them</li>
            <li> I love them. not only look nice and are packaged beautifully they feel nice on your skin when applying your makeup.</li>
            <li> I ordered the brushes back in May and having been using them everyday, washing the brushes every week and making sure they are thoroughly clean. I do absolutely love these brushes and having the container is a perk. The brushes are dense enough to pick up the product but not too dense where it takes forever to clean. I love the dense fan brush for highlighting and bronzer but it does take a little more time to blend. The brushes are absolutely soft and won&#x27;t scratch the skin which is great on clients as well. The angled dense brush is great for contouring and blending out the product. If you find yourself needing &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; brushes (no such thing), these brushes are great. Brushes either suck because they are not dense and scratchy and sheds easily, or they are great as in dense, soft, picks up and blends products well. Any great artist can make do with the products in their kit. The only reason why I gave these brushes four stars is because if you wring the brush after cleaning too hard, the bristles will fall out the first time. Otherwise I have found that the bristles stays on during following washes and works wonders and blends products well onto the skin. It&#x27;s AWWWEESOMME!!</li>
            <li> I agree with the many others who rave about these brushes.  They make my makeup look flawless.</li>
            <li> Exceptional quality! The quality of the brushes is amazing! It is the same quality as a Mac brush with beautiful handles but waaaay cheaper. I love them so much!</li>
            <li> These are amazing brushes!  They are so soft and wonderful, with great application. This is a great deal for what you get.</li>
            <li> This is a unique set of beautiful make up brushes. They have two toned tips of grey and black which sets the beauty off!! The crystal handles are long and sleek with gorgeous  designs. They&#x27;re comfortable to hold and when I use them my make up was flawless!!  This was a discounted product that I&#x27;m reviewing.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until i have had these brushes for a awhile so i can give me honest full opinion.&lt;br /&gt;1.Durability: ive washed these brushes several times so far and had very minimal shedding. I use them every single day and i can tell they are amazing quality.&lt;br /&gt;2. function: I use almost all of the brushes in the set. My favorite would have to be the fan brush. So easy so apply bronzer! I wish that the set would have included a smaller eye shadow brush, but thats just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;3. Value: everyone loves a good deal right? under $40 for all of these great brushes is a steal!&lt;br /&gt;4. Appearance: definitely the most beautiful brushes i have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I bought this  makeup brush set for a friend as a birthday gift. She absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> These are a high quality set of brushes.  I have used them for a week now.  Theyaresixtyatfaintmyskin.  My makeup spreads on evenly.  I like that it comes with a really nice magnetic box to store them in.  I also received a bonus brush with my order.  I have not used all of the brushes yet.  There are so many.</li>
            <li> If you THOUGHT you had all the brushes you need you were wrong. LOL I now have this set because I loved their first set of brushes so much! They don&#x27;t scratch your face because of the gentle synthetic quality they use for the brushes which I really appreciate. It&#x27;s a great set for any extra shadowing or contouring which we all know is very &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; at the moment :) Definitely highly recommending this product get it while it&#x27;s on sale this is such a reasonable price for the quality of brushes (coming from someone who makes a living off how her face looks trust me it can be hard to find even one blush brush under $40)</li>
            <li> Wow, definitely amazing brush set,  i saw the reviews so i decided to try , i m amazed about the quality. Thanks for the reviews made me buy this set. i usually dont write reviews since i dont have much time but i think people like me really should try,  so classy and amazing quality, i m gonna order one more for my sister,</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first bought this, but I decided to after reading the fairly good reviews about it. It came in the very next day I ordered it and when I opened it I was greeted by a very nice looking white leather like material box. The two halves of this box are held together by a pretty strong magnet and over all was impressed with the packaging. It looked fancy and professional. Plus I knew that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about my brushes being ruined while I travel since I don&#x27;t carry them in a hard case. When I opened the box  each one of the brushes were covered neatly in plastic wraps and the larger brushes had nets over the bristles to keep their shape. I was very impressed how soft they were and decided to put them through the test of the first cleaning. The very first brush set I ever bought fell apart on me on the first wash and I never bought another set again. Instead I spent hundreds of dollars on buying individual brushes from places like MAC and Sephora. To my surprise the brushes were perfectly fine and when I got around to using them I was surprised that they worked just as good as my $50+ dollar individual brushes. It is worth the buy and are very pretty to look at. I&#x27;ve used them a total of 10 times already and they don&#x27;t even have a dent. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wow...great brushes with great and soft bristles.  I always had heard great make up brushes are the key and it is so true.  These brushes pick up the product and holds onto it so you don&#x27;t waste.</li>
            <li> What a difference a good makeup brush can make! These brushes have literally cut my makeup routine in half. Great quality!</li>
            <li> Extremely soft and a great density to the face brushes. Applies and blends liquid foundations wonderfully. A nice array for makeup enthusiasts at any experience level.</li>
            <li> Kabuki Set highlights: Value. Versatility. EASY cleaning. Gorgeous presentation. GREAT for travel. VERY professional. A must HAVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Name Is Breanna. I have been working professionally in the beauty industry for over 15 years. Currently I do most of my work in Manhattan NYC and all over the world for weddings, modeling, and photography sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently reviewed the original 8 piece set from Be You, Beautifully also giving it a 5 star rating. #1 Professional 8 Piece Makeup Brush Set w/ Designer case...Check it out! Also, if you haven&#x27;t been the the Be You Beautifully dot Com website I strongly recommend a visit there! It was like hanging out with pros and girlfriends at the same time with their family owned approach! The professional make up tutorials by Allison, who I hear was trained at a very highly rated school in LA, was informative and fun to the MAX. I would send any artist or young teen learning tricks to her videos for amazing tips! Back to the Kabuki Set:  I am so so excited to now be reviewing my new favorite Crystal Kabuki Brush set! I have to start out by saying: Value. Value. VALUE!!! What a price point, what an incredible bang for my bucks! This new set utterly completes me as an equipped artist for any situation. What I liked about the original set was &amp;#34;the attention to detail&amp;#34; with this new Kabuki Crystal set I am totally ready to handle any face shape any tricky skin coverage issues, and I feel that the two sets compliment each other flawlessly. I LOVE the new Deluxe pro fan brush, which I use in almost every FINISHING situation. Powder excess under eyes? Deluxe Pro Fan. A little too much couture needing smoothing? Deluxe Pro Fan. Need a little more finishing powder? Deluxe Pro Fan! It is awesome! I love all the different shapes included for any purpose you can come up with... Flat top, detail, pointed, angled... because so much of my professional practice as a cosmotologyist is about diversity I come across so many different shapes and sizes with different things I want to emphasize. The Crystal Kabuki set offers me that amazing diversity. The 4 different options to work with eye application (or for the creative artist that subs one for concealer application) are perfect for all the smokey eyes and simple daily ideas I love to try out. If you have the original 8 piece add this one to complete your brush concert! If you don&#x27;t have either get started today! And buy them all!!! You and your bridal clients, actors, models, and family will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Good makeup deserves good brushes but who can afford name brand brushes??  These brushes took my look to the next level and I am NEVER going back to junky brushes.  These brushes made the application process easier and the makeup blended better, in addition the makeup lasted a LONG time probably because the application was much better than usual.  For the price, you can&#x27;t expect perfection.  The brushes are soft but smelled slightly strong out of the box (unnoticeable as I used them) and the blush brush is shedding a bit (though I&#x27;ve never had a blush brush that hasn&#x27;t).  I only wish they had a separate set of additional eye brushes because I don&#x27;t want to buy more fave brained to get the other eye brushes this company makes.</li>
            <li> I got this set and I was so happy and excited .the box is so adorable and the brushes are dense and super soft  . I applied my foundation using their liquid foundation brush and really it makes my foundation go smoothly and nicely . I love their fan brush and all brushes. The only reason why I am rating them 3 out of 5 is because after a wash the hair starts to come out few like 2-3 hair but that&#x27;s so much for ONE WASH ONLY  . I am so disappointed ): ONLY one wash . I am hoping no hair will come out or I will have to return it since I just bought this set .</li>
            <li> OM Goodness! I&#x27;ve been dying to get make up brushes like these. The Kabuki 8 Piece set has every brush you will ever need to have a perfectly unmade up look. My face looks flawless. I love the Fan brush because it brings it all together. No Photo-shopping needed here!</li>
            <li> Soft, non shedding, and disperses product beautifully.  Most brushes make my sensitive skin itchy - not these!  I feel like I spent way more than I did.  I have been using them for a month and l love them more every day.</li>
            <li> These brushes offer more than just a pretty design. They perform just as good as they look. The brushes are so soft and dense, feels very sturdy and well made, so there’s a good chance it’ll last through heavy usage. IM LOVING THEM !!</li>
            <li> “My set of brushes arrived right on schedule and in perfect condition. And they are even lovelier than described :-) I actually ordered these because I thought they would be pretty on my makeup table.....and they ARE!  But they&#x27;re not &amp;#34;just a pretty face&amp;#34;.  These brushes appear to be very well made and are a dream to use.  I&#x27;ve used them for about a week, and so far not so much as a stray bristle.  The bristles have a very luxurious feel and the brushes are heavy, but nicely weighted, so very easy to use.  Obviously, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  Many thanks to Be You, Beautifully!!&lt;br /&gt;A note for anyone interested:  I am not employed by Be You Beautifully (no financial interest), nor did I receive any free or discounted product :-)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the fact that the handles were clear but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much. These brushes are pretty good! i got them on sale and i really like them. some were not as dense as i hoped but with some buffing it gives an airbrushed effect. will be buying more!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really great, very soft but strong. I havent had any bristles fall out. Im still learning how to use all of them but the pamphlet it came with helps teach you all about them.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these brushes. I don&#x27;t use them all but so nice to have them when I do. They were so worth the price. And a lifetime guarantee I believe? Take care of them and you will not have to buy new brushes ever again. I use the JAPONESQUE solid brush cleaner $18.00 to wash mine. It does a nice job and leaves them clean. I recommend getting a good cleansing product it&#x27;s worth the money to take care of these beautiful and oh so soft brushes. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> So soft and pretty but eye brushes are too big</li>
            <li> I love my brushes, they make putting makeup on so easy. I would recommend these brushes over any of the brushes I have used in the past. They are soft, easy to clean and makeup goes on effortlessly. I like that they tell you which brush to use for powder, liquid makup, blush, etc. i am going to buy a travel set to take with me on trips and get rid of all the other brushes I have.</li>
            <li> Very lovely and quality brushes for the cost. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Hello. I want to thank for my Kabuki brushes. The value could not be any better.&lt;br /&gt;I try to be careful with goods, that happen to cost less than I like to think they should cost.&lt;br /&gt;The logic is &amp;#34;price&#x3D;quality&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say it short:&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 pricey professional kabuki brushes (other brand) and... there. is. no. difference, or I can&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;There were carefully examined up and down and tested in use. Good job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to pay extra for a name, you know &amp;#34; just because&amp;#34; - this is a smart choice.</li>
            <li> My gf loves the brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set so much. It was packaged very nicely and the brushes are so soft. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have performed a rugged search for quality makeup brushes at an affordable price - I have succeeded with this purchase! The main element that spiked my interest in this set, were the clear handles and satin gold accents! I am in love with the look of these brushes!!! They are truly beautiful and elegant. In addition to their elegance, they are good makeup brushes: the bristles are soft, the fibers secure, and the coverage light and clean. My only disappointment, is that there are not smaller brushes included in this design. I would love to couple this set with a set of smaller detail brushes: eyebrow, lip, smudge, and eye shadow brushes. &amp;#34;Be You, Beautifully,&amp;#34; dazzle us again with a set of precision brushes to complete our collection!</li>
            <li> I loved the brushes! They definitely help achieve that flawless finish.</li>
            <li> The set arrived surprisingly fast. The brushes were well protected by the case that came with it and the case itself looks very elegant and sturdy (altho not really sure if it&#x27;s real leather).  The bristles were soft and dense. Started using the brushes as soon as I got them and so far, no shedding, (which is what I fear and hate most on makeup brushes). I keep them in their individual net casing to hold their shape after using/cleaning. I will make an update review after a month (of using and cleaning) to see if they will hold up to non-shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After more than a month of using and regular once a week cleaning, I have noticed some minor shedding right after washing (maybe a couple of bristles). But overall, I consider them well worth it.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the quality! The box/holder is very strong and sturdy with a fitted lid. I&#x27;ve used many high quality brand brushes and these can compare or even pass them up!</li>
            <li> The Be You Beautifully Kabuki brush set is not only chic and classy, but it&#x27;s also beautiful in design. And the bristles on this brush set are amazingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s begin with the design.&lt;br /&gt;The brush handles are acrylic and the name of the brushes are etched on them to know which brush is used for what. The brushes are a little heavy in weight but nothing you can&#x27;t bear. They fit nicely in your hand and allow easy makeup application and these are very sturdy brushes .&lt;br /&gt;Now for the quality, they are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;They apply makeup whether in cream, liquid or powder form, flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;In the brush set you get 8 brushes with one oh so soft deluxe pro fluffy Fan Brush.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to do my whole makeup application with these synthetic brushes although I wish they would have included in this set a flat eyeshadow brush but regardless these brushes are multi purpose so I was able to use them for my face and my eyes, with the smaller brushes of course.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the brush holder case that they come in. The case can be opened and split and used for more brushes and it also makes it great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;This whole set displays nicely and some of the larger brushes come with netted brush guards for protection of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased and excited to own this set of kabuki brushes, once you put them against your face you will know why.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a look I did using the Crystal Be you beautifully Kabuki Brush Set.</li>
            <li> For price like this, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re all very soft and dense! and I especially like the magnetic case/holder.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! Very high quality and just as advertised! I have loved using them each morning</li>
            <li> I have gotten the set for my 🎂 birthday and 💜 I love it. Very nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Received the package very quickly. The brushes are amazing. I don&#x27;t own any other ones to compare but I really liked these and my makeup application was easy and flawless.</li>
            <li> These brushes are well worth the price.  Make up goes on smoothly. I feel I look very natural.</li>
            <li> Very nice high quality brush... It is more lush than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> Just like the other brushes I reviewed, the Be You, Chic Core Collection is the highest quality collection of brushes I have ever used. Do yourself a favor and buy both sets now! They&#x27;re better than Chanel, better than Bare Minerals, and when I wear these out I will buy more!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes a day before at 3am &amp; I got them a day after 😍 I LOVE THESE BRUSHES ! Their sooo soft &amp; I would recommend beginners like me to buy these ❤️</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Brushes are fantastic and clean well!</li>
            <li> Even the boyfriend paused his video game to gaze at these soon as they popped out the box!!! I run the fan brush down his nose and he laughed and asked me to it again.he loves how soft they feel. As for me, I&#x27;d order ten more if I could, just to gaze at. These are sexy brushes and will make you want to go and do your make up. Instantly. These are beautiful and luxurious and just sexy. A large powder brush, stippling brush, a bonus denser flat top kabuki,and eye set in the crystal edition and I&#x27;m taking them to heaven if God will let me. Get these damnit. Now. For this price, and what u get, you should be smacked off the fence if you r on it about these. Will serve you right if they r sold out or u blink one time n open ur eyes to find they tripled in price.And the customer service is Superior. These ppl make you feel special.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes! These brushes are soft, high quality &amp; work great with mineral makeup &amp; pigments, blending is easy &amp; flawless, will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these! They are SO glamorous! The brushes are beautiful and very sturdy. The magnetic box they come in make for great storage. The set includes in detail directions on how to care and clean your brushes. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes of great quality! They are individually wrapped and don&#x27;t have a chemical smell that most synthetic brushes have. Overall it&#x27;s an amazing, beautifully packaged set of brushes! Very pleased and will buy some for my sister!!!</li>
            <li> i have thrown away all other brushes I&#x27;ve had. these are amazing!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this brush set! Easy to clean, helps blends my makeup superbly! Love the style its so modern and down right pretty! A perfect choice at a perfect price!</li>
            <li> I bought this Crystal Kabuki for my wife and she loves the set.  Comes with a nice case.  The synthetic brush fibers are quality.</li>
            <li> So soft and beautiful. Makes you feel like you are at a high end boutique getting your face done professionally. So many brushes to get exactly the look you want.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very well crafted and so soft. I used them for the first time on a trip to Vegas and I was amazed at how well these brushes applied my make up. I used these brushes with cream, liquid, and powder products and they worked really well. I really liked the fan brush because it evenly distributed my powder makeup and was the perfect tool for my finishing powder. Really awesome product.</li>
            <li> I have used these brushes every day since I got them.  I have also washed them several times.  They have not shed, lost their shape or fallen apart.  These are the best brushes and the price is amazing. I find myself comparing them to my IT Cosmetic brushes, they are so soft and do great when picking up and applying products!  I will definately buy more Be You, Beautifully brushes!  This was a great purchase for me!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great and the seller (family owned business) is even better. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I left a review for this companies other makeup brush set (http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ICYS0COOVYP5/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00KVOFOCY&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760911&amp;store&#x3D;beauty) and after being completely blown away by that I knew I had to buy their other set. The two sets together will largely be all the brushes you will ever need and they come with a lifetime guarantee. This review will echo much of what I said in my other review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are wonderful. Extremely dense, fluffy, SO soft and application is flawless. These brushes do not shed and they come with properly fitted brush guards to keep them safe in their case and keep their shape while drying, I have never had brushes come with actual brush guards and I have purchased a wide range of make up brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is the same that came with the other set although in white. The case is simply amazing. Rock solid leather and opens in the middle and is held together by a strong magnet. It is a beautiful case and I have never seen a rectangular case before Be you, beautifully&#x27;s sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are gorgeous and the craftsmanship is impeccable. The handles are crystal clear and so unique and seem to be made of a plexiglas and the ferrules are a matte gold finish, the brushes and case match perfectly. Some of the most beautiful brushes I&#x27;ve ever seen and they are incredibly classy. Thick handles, correct length, rock solid ferrules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While all the brushes in this set are incredible I would like to focus specifically on the fan brush, it is AMAZING!!! This is the only usable fan brush I&#x27;ve ever bought as so many fan brushes have so little thought put into them. They are too thin, too tiny or wayy too large, thicker but not dense enough however this one is perfect. It is the correct size in terms of largeness and is very VERY dense all the way through. It applies powder to your face and neck flawlessly and I tend to use it last to give that airbrushed look and a light coaton your neck. I am SO grateful a company finally nailed the fan brush. (you can now buy it separately but I really recommend the whole set)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you go at it and purchase these brushes asap, as the other set is currently sold out and has been selling out very quickly these brushes are getting more and more popular and hopefully the price will not start doing the creep (like Sigma did...). These are high end professional makeup brushes and I wish I had found these before I dropped lots and lots of $$$ on experimenting with so many other kinds.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!!! I&#x27;ve never had a brush set before and wanted one but couldn&#x27;t afford anything expensive.  I&#x27;m going to order another set! The case they come in is nice.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes!! Soft brissels that don&#x27;t fall out and stab your face!! Can&#x27;t wait to see more product!</li>
            <li> I purchased the The CRYSTAL KABUKI COLLECTION Brush Set as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift to myself and it was love at first sight.  The entire set screams of High Quality starting from the case, which is both, beautiful and practical.  The brushes are dense and firm specially designed for the professional makeup artists or aficionados like myself.  I highly recommend anyone to invest on any of the Be You, Beautifully Brushes Sets I confidently assure you that you will not be disappointed -  no need to spend exuberant amounts of money for other sets when this one is both, affordable and well made.  My teenage daughter fell in love with it too, therefore, I had no choice but to buy her a set for herself - she couldn&#x27;t thank me enough.  Try it, you will love it too.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and so nice.  Would buy again in a heartbeat.  Super Fast shipping and great quality.  Not one fiber has shed.  Nice, Full, BEAUTIFUL!!!!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:2904123fc7ccda2868278f8be09019a4]] I was honestly amazed of the quality of the brushes. The packaging from inside out was great, very pretty to give as a gift. The brushes were protected even further by being in plastic and bristles wrapped so they wouldn&#x27;t get damaged. They are extremely soft! The handles are very sturdy and you can&#x27;t see glue like other cheap brushes. Washing them was easy and no shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please watch video for a more in depth review and to see how nicely they&#x27;re packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Gently wash the brushes that you use after each use using a gentle soap or cleaning solution specially designed for makeup brushes. It will preserve the brushes, prevent spread of bacteria, and prevent them from eventually shedding due to not being cared for properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;11/9 Since reviewing the brushes I&#x27;ve been using them every other day and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding of the brush and they&#x27;re just as soft, fluffy, full and good quality as they were here in the video. I still keep the mesh net over each brush after I clean them so maybe that&#x27;s why they look so good still. The handles are still just as strong and not falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to YouTube to watch in 1080p&lt;br /&gt;* Sample received in exchange for a honest review</li>
            <li> Love the brushes! It was really impressive to have the follow-up and information about using, cleaning ,storing and all the thought and hard work to created an exceptional Makeup brush set....Thanks.</li>
            <li> Kabuki Set highlights: Value. Versatility. EASY cleaning. Gorgeous presentation. GREAT for travel. VERY professional. A must HAVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Name Is Breanna. I have been working professionally in the beauty industry for over 15 years. I recently reviewed the original 8 piece set from Be You, Beautifully also giving it a 5 star rating. #1 Professional 8 Piece Makeup Brush Set w/ Designer case...Check it out! Also, if you haven&#x27;t been the the Be You Beautifully dot Com website I strongly recommend a visit there! It was like hanging out with pros and girlfriends at the same time with their family owned approach! The professional make up tutorials by Allison, who I hear was trained at a very highly rated school in LA, was informative and fun to the MAX. I would send any artist or young teen learning tricks to her videos for amazing tips! Back to the Kabuki Set:  I am so so excited to now be reviewing my new favorite Crystal Kabuki Brush set! I have to start out by saying: Value. Value. VALUE!!! What a price point, what an incredible bang for my bucks! This new set utterly completes me as an equipped artist for any situation. What I liked about the original set was &amp;#34;the attention to detail&amp;#34; with this new Kabuki Crystal set I am totally ready to handle any face shape any tricky skin coverage issues, and I feel that the two sets compliment each other flawlessly. I LOVE the new Deluxe pro fan brush, which I use in almost every FINISHING situation. Powder excess under eyes? Deluxe Pro Fan. A little too much couture needing smoothing? Deluxe Pro Fan. Need a little more finishing powder? Deluxe Pro Fan! It is awesome! I love all the different shapes included for any purpose you can come up with... Flat top, detail, pointed, angled... because so much of my professional practice as a cosmotologyist is about diversity I come across so many different shapes and sizes with different things I want to emphasize. The Crystal Kabuki set offers me that amazing diversity. The 4 different options to work with eye application (or for the creative artist that subs one for concealer application) are perfect for all the smokey eyes and simple daily ideas I love to try out. If you have the original 8 piece add this one to complete your brush concert! If you don&#x27;t have either get started today! And buy them all!!! You and your bridal clients, actors, models, and family will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very good and i am happy with it the quality of it.</li>
            <li> I am pleasently surprised! I was sick and tired of those nasty harsh strokes on my face due to cheap quality brushes. I was 2 seconds away from buying new ones at Ulta when my friend recommended me to purchase them oline instead. I found these ones and it was kind of love at first sight. Actually, more like love at average consumer review rates. I gave it a try and I am impressed! It makes my foundation and concealer look flawless. The only thing is that the packaging is a tad annoying when I am closing it. I am afraid to damage the brushes and I have to be extra careful when doing so, but that is probably just me. Overall, these brushes are not just great, but they are really cute looking and affordable!</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and dense and don&#x27;t shed, exactly what was described and what I wanted. They arrived very quickly along with a pamphlet that describes each brushes use along with a letter from the owner which, to me, makes it even more worth buying for the customer service. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush set for a little over 2+ months, an I cannot express enough of how ecstatic I am with these tools. This is my second time purchasing a set of brushes from this company, and I must say that they have really outdone themselves. These brushes apply makeup flawlessly! Never would I have imagined that I would be having an affair on Shiseido Flat Kabuki Foundation Brush with another Flat Kabuki, yet I am and I don&#x27;t feel guilty! It is that AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes remain intact at all times after repeated washes without one hair falling out of place. Oh My Freaking Gosh...I am in love!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crystal handles are such a beautiful touch, It definitely adds a touch of elegance. These brushes are worth soooo much more than the price that is being offered. Grab these and never let go!!!</li>
            <li> Why use the fan brush as the main star of this kit to lure customers? I have no idea. The quality control is surely lacking, the ferrule of my fan brush is cut out very awkwardly, so it doesn&#x27;t fan out evenly; I didn&#x27;t notice this until after I cleansed the brush after taking it out when I first received it in the mail. It&#x27;s bent in such a ridiculous way, so I wouldn&#x27;t bother using it-was hoping to use it for highlighting. The only positive thing that I&#x27;ll say about this fan brush is that it does have a great amount of synthetic fibers for highlighting application, BUT, it wouldn&#x27;t deliver as well-due to the uneven cut of the ferrel. This leaves me to question if all the fan brushes were made this way, and are people just making do with this? The flat top kabuki doesn&#x27;t have enough stiffness, as it doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough hair as the Sigma F80 as well, so I can only imagine that applying foundation will only take more time. The tapered kabuki brush is not fun to clean either: it doesn&#x27;t rinse well when it comes to cleaning (I&#x27;ve tried rinsing my Philosophy purity cleanser off of it for at least 4 times now), which I just gave up on it. The other brushes are okay, but given the few faulty brushes, this kit doesn&#x27;t even deserve a shrug and a &amp;#34;meh, it&#x27;s alright.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it looks so fancy.. really beautiful design and very classy.. i havnt tried the brushes though but i trust the reviews.. i just cant get over the classy look of the brushes- crystal.. i love it.. hope it does good too..</li>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful!! I never thought makeup brushes could be so nice!!  Just make sure you wash them first before using.</li>
            <li> High quality with pride in craftsmanship. Brushes are soft and plush. Directions are helpful. Seller is vested in your 100% satisfaction, which I am.</li>
            <li> Great packaging and wonderful brushes</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic! Professional- strong! Easy to wash!</li>
