            <li>and I finally found a gorgeous hair oil!</li>
            <li>and I still have fine hair, but it&#x27;s gotten wavy</li>
            <li>Love this hair oil - smells great, keeps my hair hydrated -- I like it a lot better than Moroccan oil which I had been using for a few years before switching to this product</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>it is a great product.much better than morrocan oil or any other hair serum/oil</li>
            <li>This product absolutely saves my hair!!!</li>

            <li>Live for #4 hair care line!  </li>
            <li>If you look at the ingredients, it&#x27;s your standard silicone shine serum, mostly composed of cyclopentasiloxane, a non-biodegradable ingredient -- same main ingredient in Frizz-Ease.</li>
            <li>half a pump(a little goes a long way) and your hair looks beautiful!</li>
            <li>and I can only use certain hair products on it</li>
            <li>Absorbs well and still allows for natural movement.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>never weighs heavily down and is absorbed by my hair.</li>
            <li>I used to use several different oils/ serums, and have been able to narrow it down to one to get the job done.</li>

            <li> I used to use several different oils/ serums, and have been able to narrow it down to one to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and this product helps to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> For extra shine just a tiny amount goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> 3 weeks ago I had a hair mishap, and long story short had to color my hair twice in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I started coloring it red 11 years ago, and then 5 years ago I turned 30 and started getting grey hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every single time I shower, but I use it every 2-3 times and I only use it on my damp hair, not dry because I felt like using it on my dry hair made it get oily faster.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry and frizzy from the greying/coloring.</li>
            <li> I used this Elixer on my hair as directed and had absolutely no damage problems!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried other brands&#x27; stuff like this</li>
            <li> If your hair a little on the dry side, use</li>
            <li> My brother works at an airport and found this stuff and gave it to me about 4 months ago since his wife was out of town and the bottle was about half empty.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with those oils, they just were to much oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> It tames the frizz/dryness but doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in this product</li>

            <li> I use this product every time I style my hair. I have color treated hair (yes, damaged) and this makes my hair smooth &amp;soft.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this on me and I love the smell. It&#x27;s like, but floral-sweet...but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. If your hair a little on the dry side, use half a pump(a little goes a long way) and your hair looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  3 weeks ago I had a hair mishap, and long story short had to color my hair twice in 2 days. I used this Elixer on my hair as directed and had absolutely no damage problems!  My hair is shiny and healthy looking.  This is a product I will never be without!!!</li>
            <li> I grew up with blonde, baby fine, stick straight hair. I started coloring it red 11 years ago, and then 5 years ago I turned 30 and started getting grey hair. Fast forward to now and I still have fine hair, but it&#x27;s gotten wavy and it&#x27;s dry and frizzy from the greying/coloring. This product absolutely saves my hair!!! It tames the frizz/dryness but doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down at all. I&#x27;ve searched for a product like this for years, so happy to have found this after reading great reviews. I use this number 4 product along with the Kukui shampoo/conditioner from organix...it&#x27;s the perfect trifecta for me to maintain moisture without my hair being oily, which is what would happen when I used argan or coconut oil. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with those oils, they just were to much oil for my hair. So if you have hair like mine, or just want your healthy hair to look even more amazing, I highly recommend Number 4</li>
            <li> Live for #4 hair care line!  For extra shine just a tiny amount goes a long way!  Absorbs well and still allows for natural movement.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. Makes my hair feel so hydrated and not greasy at all. The perfect amount of shine! What a beautiful product ! I have been doing hair for twenty years and I finally found a gorgeous hair oil!</li>
            <li> Love this hair oil - smells great, keeps my hair hydrated -- I like it a lot better than Moroccan oil which I had been using for a few years before switching to this product</li>
            <li> nothing special. save yourself the money and go to rite aid or something and pick up something different.</li>
            <li> this product is the only hair serum /oil that doesnt change the blonde color of my hair. it is a great product.much better than morrocan oil or any other hair serum/oil i have ever used</li>
            <li> Great product! Leaves hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> My brother works at an airport and found this stuff and gave it to me about 4 months ago since his wife was out of town and the bottle was about half empty. I don&#x27;t use it every single time I shower, but I use it every 2-3 times and I only use it on my damp hair, not dry because I felt like using it on my dry hair made it get oily faster. I have about an inch left in the bottle so it lasts a long time! Another thing I love about this is that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I have extremely sensitive skin and I can only use certain hair products on it and I&#x27;ve tried other brands&#x27; stuff like this and it always makes me break out.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely  love it. My hair always feels super soft after I use it. &lt;3</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use many types of repair oils and I love this Elixer!! It&#x27;s great as on damp hair to condition and great to use as styling product to tame fly aways.</li>

            <li> It makes my hair nice and shiny I would recommend this product it works great. I like, it alot try it</li>
            <li> If you look at the ingredients, it&#x27;s your standard silicone shine serum, mostly composed of cyclopentasiloxane, a non-biodegradable ingredient -- same main ingredient in Frizz-Ease. Every brand from drugstore to high-end has a silicone serum like this. It&#x27;s quite pricey for something very, very basic.</li>
