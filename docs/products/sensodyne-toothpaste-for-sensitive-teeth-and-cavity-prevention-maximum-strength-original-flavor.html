            <li> A few months ago, I awoke one morning with a very sensitive upper front tooth.  </li>

            <li> sure however, that whatever sensitivity-relieving product you purchase (whether Sensodyne or others) contains the active ingredient Potassium Nitrate (5%), which will fill in the areas in the tooth that are exposed to the cold elements.</li>

            <li> Sensodyne original toothpaste is disappearing off retail market shelves and after using this product for about 50 years I am totally disappointed in this fact and am now having to rely on other means to obtain this product.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Lately we added in ACT II Fluoride Mouthwash and that&#x27;s also helping as the sensitivity has progressed with age.</li>
            <li> (some long name) which is bad for canker sores.</li>
            <li> Each time a cold substance (even a rush of air) passed over that tooth, it would send a jolt of pain through my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is the only toothpaste that cuts out the Sod... Ly...(some long name) which is bad for canker sores. This is all I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sensodyne Original formula for over 30 years.  I have very sensitive teeth because my gums have receded over the years exposing the root.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and other formulas within the Sensodyne line, but the Original formula is the only one that works.  Without Sensodyne, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> Expires nect month June.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected. Sensodyne original toothpaste is disappearing off retail market shelves and after using this product for about 50 years I am totally disappointed in this fact and am now having to rely on other means to obtain this product. In the near future I will be ordering some more of this product provided by Bargain-Master through AMAZON. GOOD SHOW.... Paul P.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I awoke one morning with a very sensitive upper front tooth.  Each time a cold substance (even a rush of air) passed over that tooth, it would send a jolt of pain through my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was puzzled by this, as I had never had trouble with teeth sensitivity before, but on the advice of my Dad (a dentist) I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days of rubbing this paste on the sensitive tooth, my problem completely disappeared and I have not had any problems since!  I now alternate brushing with this product and a better-tasting paste (the chalky taste is the one downside of Sensodyne) and that system seems to prevent any sensitivity from developing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure however, that whatever sensitivity-relieving product you purchase (whether Sensodyne or others) contains the active ingredient Potassium Nitrate (5%), which will fill in the areas in the tooth that are exposed to the cold elements.</li>
            <li> This original flavor senodyne is the only one without so much mint that makes me choke. And I can&#x27;t find it in any of the store nearby and I live in S.F.</li>
            <li> My dad has very sensitive teeth and loves this toothpaste. It&#x27;s a little bit cheaper on here than at the local store, plus convenient for me to get it delivered. He&#x27;s used this successfully for many years. Lately we added in ACT II Fluoride Mouthwash and that&#x27;s also helping as the sensitivity has progressed with age.</li>
            <li> Its the best toothoaste for sensitive trete!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s the ONLY deal in town. The stores most often do not carry the Original Sensodyne, without the whiteners added. The whiteners burn my mouth so I need the good old plain stuff. Online is the only way to go for this. It is delivered to my door within 3 or 4 days. Saves me the gas of going all over looking for it.</li>
            <li> I like this, because I can&#x27;t use these new ones.  This is the only one I can use for my sensitive teeth.  And not so many place sell it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I can get it from here.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as used to be, good value but still short of the original formula years back. Expecting more but not as strong as I like for the brand label.</li>
            <li> This product is part of my life. I am very satisfied with this purchase, but the price rose too. In July, 2012, I purchased a $ 18.00 pack of 4 tubes, now costs $ 24.00. But I love it anyway.</li>
            <li> I love this one above and beyond all toothpastesand all other Sensodyne toothpastes !</li>
            <li> Bought many of this toothpastes, outside rough package but inside the toothpaste was fine.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste I hope you have more available in the future. I don&#x27;t see it in the stores around me anymore. It seems that every time I get to like something, they get rid of it. Same goes for some of the movies on tv I like. Strange isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> My wife has used it for years and is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Excellent - no more pain.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth for no reason, no cavities, no problems. This toothpaste helps so that I can eat the foods I love with no problems. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores so I am glad I am able to buy it on Amazon. The other Sensodyne flavors give me canker sores, but this one doesn&#x27;t, so I am sticking with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Sensodyne. What more can you say? I&#x27;m glad to find the one without whitener.</li>
            <li> Great product, great taste for a sensitive toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve tried many, and this is my favorite.</li>
