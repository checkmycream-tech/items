            <li>I enjoyed mine so much I bought my son one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been keeping mine in its original box.  </li>
            <li>first I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the closure on the case.  </li>
            <li>This case isn&#x27;t anything special to glow about but it is sufficient for storing each of the heads and the brush.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t already have the Professional Skin Care System by ToiletTree, be sure to get  yours today and order the case with additional heads as well.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I absolutely love the water resistant Face and Body Professional Skin Care System by ToiletTree Products.  </li>
            <li>it is not sold with the implement in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I love the big brush head for an all over body scrub.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll feel the same way.  </li>
            <li>Then I shook it over my bed to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t pop open while doing that.  </li>
            <li>Also that it keeps my Face and Body Professional Skin Care system and all it&#x27;s attachments clean and organized no matter where I am.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been in love with, and using, the Professional Skin Care Brushes since first got them several months ago.  </li>
            <li>If you take it with you in a suitcase be careful what you pack around and on top of it, again, it is plastic and it will break.</li>
            <li>I also really like each of the face and body brushes for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>The case fits everything and has room to fit all of the different want attachments.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found out that ToiletTree Products now offers a storage case for their water resistant Face and Body Professional Skin Care System.  </li>
            <li>Other than that i love the travel case.  </li>
            <li>Update love the case so that minor issue with the soft brush doesn&#x27;t matter to me anymore.</li>
            <li>They really should sell it with the main unit.  </li>
            <li>Even better quality than I expected wish i&#x27;d bought it at the same time I bough the face brush!</li>
            <li>A must buy for anyone who has their professional face and body brush!</li>
            <li>the soft brushwas brownish as if it had been used b4.</li>

            <li> This case isn&#x27;t anything special to glow about but it is sufficient for storing each of the heads and the brush.  It is plastic so don&#x27;t drop it or it will break.  If you take it with you in a suitcase be careful what you pack around and on top of it, again, it is plastic and it will break.</li>
            <li> We did not reserved the machine only the brush  we order the machine togather with the brush it should be same second picture</li>
            <li> perfect case for storage of brush.  It&#x27;s too bad it is not sold with the implement in the first place.  I don&#x27;t need the extra brushes yet so will have to store those while I use the case.</li>

            <li> Case was just what i needed. Would&#x27;ve given 5 starsbut the soft brushwas brownish as if it had been used b4. Other than that i love the travel case.  Update love the case so that minor issue with the soft brush doesn&#x27;t matter to me anymore.

            <li> Perfect! Just what the ToiletTree Face &amp; Body Brush System Needed!!! A must buy for anyone who has their professional face and body brush!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found out that ToiletTree Products now offers a storage case for their water resistant Face and Body Professional Skin Care System.  The compact case to store and protect my Skin Care System along with is attachments keeps everything in one place and neatly organized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is strong and sturdy and perfect for travel.  I love that I now have replacements brushes and a pumice when mine become worn out.  I use the brushes to exfoliate my skin on a regular basis, and especially before using self tanner to get a even tan.  I love the big brush head for an all over body scrub.  The pumice stone is a must to slough off tough, dried skin and dead skin cells on your feet, nails and elbows,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t purchase the Professional Skin Care System by ToiletTree, I encourage you to do just that.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied with mine and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll feel the same way.  Be sure to order the case with the replacement heads.  It&#x27;s a great item for a wonderful price.  #toilettree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I received the storage case and additional replacement heads to facilitate my review.  As always all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Use it everyday with a product from an essential oil base and it works perfect.  Buying these for gifts for women in my family this year.</li>
            <li> This awesome storage and travel case from ToiletTree is awesome I have the Face and Body Professional Skin Care System which again is excellent, but didn&#x27;t have a great way to store it in my bathroom. I also wanted to be able to take it with me when I travel without getting my brush dirty. The compact case is awesome! I love that the case is super sturdy. Also that it keeps my Face and Body Professional Skin Care system and all it&#x27;s attachments clean and organized no matter where I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also really impressed with the four different replacement heads. My favorite right now is the Pumice stone...perfect for keeping my feet looking soft. Especially since I ONLY wear sandals throughout the Spring, Summer and Fall! I also really like each of the face and body brushes for exfoliating. I definitely recommend this sturdy little case to store your ToiletTree Face and Body Care System in!</li>
            <li> Perfect case with good solid snap shut feature .  Even better quality than I expected wish i&#x27;d bought it at the same time I bough the face brush!</li>

            <li> I have been in love with, and using, the Professional Skin Care Brushes since first got them several months ago.  And now this storage and travel case completes the set! It is a perfect companion piece to keep everything nicely together, and the replacement brushes are just icing on the cake. The case has a nice feel to the exterior finish and a good snap closure.  Very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> Great case.  They really should sell it with the main unit.  You do get more brushes with it.  That is a plus.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful case that conveniently stores your system. Since it is summer time and lots of people are vacationing, this case would be great for traveling. It&#x27;s got all the attachments you need and a place just for them. It even has a place for your Face &amp; Body Brush System. This case could also be used at home to store your whole system so you have everything in a nice neat place. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> nice size case -good for storage and/or travel .Since it also includes brushes,it is an excellent value .</li>
            <li> First of all, I absolutely love the water resistant Face and Body Professional Skin Care System by ToiletTree Products.  The biggest drawback was that there was no storage case.  I&#x27;ve been keeping mine in its original box.  Now I no longer have to do that.  I now have a sturdy plastic case that will hold my Skin Care System plus additional brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the closure on the case.  It seemed like it would pop open at any time.  Well, I accidentally dropped my case with everything in it while I was putting it away, and it never popped open at all.  I was impressed.  Then I shook it over my bed to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t pop open while doing that.  It didn&#x27;t.  This was alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t already have the Professional Skin Care System by ToiletTree, be sure to get  yours today and order the case with additional heads as well.  You will be happy you did.  Replacement heads can also be ordered as well.  #toilettree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the storage case with additional replacement heads for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping new in box works great</li>
