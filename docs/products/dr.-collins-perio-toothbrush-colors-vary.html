            <li>but I&#x27;m so happy I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I Love it!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>quality is very good though.</li>
            <li>Very good buy.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect, softness is great.</li>
            <li>The thinner polyester bristles get between teeth and gum line incredibly well.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m finding that a good manual is the best way to go ... and way cheaper.</li>
            <li>Just among the best on the market, and you can get a good deal on them with the subscribe and save program if you get 5 products in one month and get the 15% off.</li>
            <li>Happy for them, but it didn&#x27;t work out for me.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>and also there are a great quantity/density of bristles</li>
            <li>but I heard about these through the grapevine as a great perio alternative.  </li>
            <li>And they work great.  </li>
            <li>These are great toothbrushes</li>
            <li>These are great tooth brushes.</li>

            <li>And they do a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>; Well, I am now one of those who have derived joy from this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am using them with Weleda toothpaste (another great discovery).</li>

            <li>If there&#x27;s any truth to these not being as effective as less-soft ones in getting rid of plaque, I&#x27;m just keeping a tougher grade toothbrush on hand to use (reluctantly) now and again.</li>

            <li>I love the softness yet effectiveness of the brush.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 more.</li>
            <li>most toothbrush&#x27;s have their namebrand on them.</li>
            <li>I found one I like even better (softer and gentler on perio gums), but this one was my favorite until then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The even better toothbrush is the Nimbus Microfine:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LB8J06?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00</li>
            <li>, sensitivity was gone for me in two days and keeps my mouth feeling much better than Sensodyne ever did.</li>

            <li>Definitely one of the best tooth brushes out there!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully these will help him to have better hygene with this.</li>
            <li>I wish it comes in in more colors.</li>

            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but I can feel it working into the cracks btwn my teeth more.</li>
            <li>Better than anything I can get in the store, even the health food store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bristlings of softiness anti-irritates my gums and makes my enamelsweepings most pleasurable.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I now find my gums feel much better too.</li>
            <li>But it is somewhat of a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrushes she gives me</li>
            <li>I was very happy to finally find something like this, and it was cheaper for a pack of 3 than you&#x27;d pay for 1 or 2 toothbrushes at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I tried Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush and love it.  </li>
            <li>Very happy and will continue to order these in the future.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This was the best deal (cheaper than the gas to drive from store to store) &amp; will definitely refer it</li>
            <li>Much better than the ones i&#x27;ve bought from the store.</li>
            <li>Simply the very best if you have gum problems.</li>
            <li>After using many &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes I was still having issues with receding gums.</li>
            <li>With the Dr. Collins brush, my teeth get cleaner (gets into every nook and cranny), there is no abrasion and the brush lasts for more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>glad I got the 3 pack</li>
            <li>I have receding gums as most people that find there way to specialized tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>I will buy more to have on hand for guests and travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve all the top electric brushes</li>

            <li>my dentist said I was doing much better.</li>
            <li>Except I brush with toothpaste, not butter, most of the time.  </li>
            <li>this is even better.  </li>
            <li>I really love them.  </li>

            <li>just feels different,and in a good way!i would definitely buy some more.</li>
            <li>far these brushes are surprisingly durable, and a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>I heard that soft tooth brushes are the best to use, but It always seemed to me that soft bristles wouldn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have that wonderfully sparkling clean shine and slippery feel, everyday...</li>
            <li>I originally received one for free</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and smooth after use.  </li>
            <li>After the first brushing I could tell the difference - my teeth had never felt more smooth.</li>
            <li>I thought the super soft toothbrushes from Gum was good...</li>
            <li>So the hunt was on for a good quality super soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft on your gums and gives them a great massage, soft on your teeth, the bristles are sturdy yet incredibly flexible, and it rests flat on counter tops</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>My original review still holds.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I gave these one star after first buying them more than a year ago.</li>
            <li>Years ago I was told they were receding some, so that&#x27;s an improvement, and I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Well, Dr. Collins is the most gentle of all!</li>
            <li>No matter how long I brush my teeth, my gums feel really great when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get excited by a toothbrush</li>
            <li>Dentist has been wanting me to get surgery for some time to give me more gum where its receding, but I keep putting it off because I&#x27;m not in pain thanks to these!</li>
            <li>For the first I can brush my teeth without worrying to bleed. :)))))</li>
            <li>Smile!</li>
            <li>After a month, I have noticed a significant improvement of my gums.</li>
            <li>But I will certainly keep buying this brush until something better becomes available.</li>
            <li>The fine tips clean really thoroughly without causing more gum recession or bleeding.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came with some kind of tongue cleaner on the back side, but other than that, it is awesome.</li>
            <li>Excellent  product, extra soft brushes, brush well without harming the gums.</li>
            <li>I have gum line recession, so I chose those brushes to gently clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>After brushing my teeth feel squeaky clean like they do after having my teeth cleaned and polished at the dentists office.</li>
            <li>you know your teeth are clean without ripping up your gums in the process.</li>
            <li>And anything to make your brushing experience more comfortable to help you brush longer is what really matters in the end.</li>
            <li>my teeth felt soooo clean...</li>
            <li>polyester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and seems to reach areas between teeth and gums better than most.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>Extra Soft brushes from my dentist (which were awesome),</li>
            <li>They are soft, the angle is perfect for getting to molars, and the design is simple.</li>
            <li>Much more effective than regular</li>
            <li>I always thought you needed power tools and hooks to clean teeth like dentists do.</li>
            <li>Not so with this brush; my teeth feel polished and clean</li>
            <li>And when it&#x27;s all said and done, I know it&#x27;s not all clean because there are places</li>
            <li>After brushing, my mouth feels sparkling clean, so I plan to continue using these unless my dentist indicates they have caused a problem.</li>
            <li>you get floss like clean feeling.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t harm my gume; helps me clean insides of cheeks and surface of tongue, etc.</li>
            <li>Nothing special to write home about.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you don&#x27;t get that good initial clean.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to brush too hard and these are the perfect answer for that.</li>
            <li>Amazing, soooo super soft!</li>
            <li>For timings of great lengths, my past enamelsweepers have most harmfully irritatinglies my gums.</li>
            <li>Past generations of criticreviewers praise most excellentingly the feather-like softiness of the enamelsweepers, so I with interest much great orderbought</li>
            <li>The soft bristles feels amazing on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>my teeth still feel super clean.  </li>
            <li>I have a permanent retainer affixed to my front teeth, top and bottom and this toothbrush makes up for the fact that I can&#x27;t floss very well between the wires.       </li>
            <li>The claims are true...</li>
            <li>Full sized head saves on brushing time.</li>
            <li>They do a better job and are gentle on gums.</li>
            <li>This is the softest, most gentle toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>When it came time to replace the brush, I tried to find the same one and couldn&#x27;t, but I thought this would be a good substitute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered a full stock of them for my bathroom backups.</li>
            <li>The reviews singing the praises were true.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes have really nice soft bristles.</li>
            <li>The most immediate thing I noticed about this brush was how gentle it is to your gums.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good toothbrush as the stores usually only carry two or three brands.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this brush gently massages my gums &amp; teeth</li>
            <li>Nice and soft, with a bristle configuration that helps get in between teeth as well as gums.</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Answer Periowash Alcohol-free Mouthwash, Cool Mint, 16-Ounce]]</li>
            <li>Not really so bad...</li>
            <li>These tooth brush is soft on the gum and still brushes your teeth pretty good.</li>
            <li>The gentle clean is well worth the cost in my opinion, as keeping your teeth and gums healthy is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Bristles are long which go into the space between teeth to clean out good</li>
            <li>so it does get your teeth very clean but is still very gentle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great, one step away from velvet, and hasn&#x27;t made my gums bleed once like other brands do.</li>
            <li>Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush is as close as we have been able to find anywhere and possibly even better than what we were using before.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are comfy however a tad smaller than a regular brush but does excellent.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is oft for sensitive gums and is good for anyone who wants to protect their gums and the enamel on their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles do not warp quickly and the bristles retain their shape well.</li>
            <li>great soft brush for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>These are the best toothbrushes I have ever used, I have been using them for about 3 years now and would never go back to regular ones.</li>
            <li>and I find it adequate.</li>
            <li>I will be buying many more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy them since at the time of my first purchase</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for better oral care.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really makes cleaning that area easy as the bristles fit right into the teeth crevices.</li>
            <li>It really gets em squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel fabulously clean and polished- better than the clean you get with a sonic brush and light years ahead of standard brushes.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I was expecting a GOOD brush, but I was surprised to find out its an AMAZING brush... takes a lil longer to use than the sonicare, but my teeth and gums are actually cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle was pretty comfortable, though.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and the bristles are nice and soft and fit under the gum line without doing any damage to the tissues.</li>
            <li>I never thought that I would be so excited over a toothbrush, but these are so different than the run of the mill drugstore kind.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft, as our dentist has recommended, and they seem to get below the gumline and clean between the teeth better than any toothbrush you&#x27;ll find in the store.  </li>
            <li>very fine and soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it feels and how clean my mouth felt after brushing!</li>
            <li>this toothbrush has sharp fine brissles  soft good to scrape off all the plaque I love it</li>
            <li>Having had sore gums and some Perio problems I thought it was time to try some new products to better care for my teeth.</li>
            <li>Great brush leaves mouth feeling deep cleaned, the way normal tooth brushes can not do.  </li>
            <li>WOW finally here is a Perio toothbrush for older adults that actually is wonderful to use.</li>
            <li>It is just want I needed - my only regret is that it took so long to find the perfect toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I replace my toothbrushes every 3 months but could easily use this one for much longer.  </li>
            <li>I am going through chemo and my gums are very tender and bleed easily.  </li>
            <li>it is very soft and I feel it cleans better than the toothbrush found in the stores</li>
            <li>This is perfect - the head is big enough and the bristles really seem to clean well despite their softness.  </li>
            <li>finally found these toothbrushes after some browsing, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love how soft the bristles are!</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean and the bristles don&#x27;t bend or splay as easily as on regular toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far so good, it&#x27;s very soft</li>
            <li>The fine bristles really do get between my teeth, and they massage my gums, too.</li>
            <li>I wanted something gentle for my gums, and these fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the 10-pack of ABC toothbrushes that I purchased from Amazon a few months ago, these aren&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>They are gentle on my gums and do a fabulous job on cleaning my teeth/</li>
            <li>and wow is it fantastic!  </li>
            <li>If it was a soft bristle, it would not be able to push all the way through the spacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so everything has been more sensitive since then.  </li>
            <li>Im always picking up \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes at many stores &amp; NEVER found a truly soft one.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush cleans better than the rest and it is feather soft on the gums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different toothbrushes over the years, never have I used one as comfortable as Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I always used soft toothbrushes, but these are so much better than you can get in the toothbrush section in the store.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price</li>
            <li>I hope a long long time because this is the best performing toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>The first time I used this toothbrush it did feel pretty good, but afterwards my gums felt like I&#x27;d brushed with razorblades.</li>
            <li>Cleans between teeth better than my old sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I use a sonic toothbrush at night, but I can&#x27;t use it more than once a day, or my teeth get sensitive.</li>
            <li>You get 3 tooth brush in the pack and they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s actually better than OralB, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>I hope to keep my gums healthy until I die of old age.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>It makes it fun to brush.</li>
            <li>I actually could see and feel better clean the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually excited by the prospect of having this clean feeling being a part of my daily routine without all the time, effort, and hassle to get less than ideal results.</li>
            <li>and you really feel a different kind of clean feeling after brushing with this</li>
            <li>Super soft and easy on the gums.</li>
            <li>I keep extra toothbrushes for all kinds of reasons and I really like the products that Dr. Collins makes, they are all pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, the head of the toothbrush is perfectly sized for my relatively small palate.</li>
            <li>If you want a clean mouth and gentle bristles that</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes clean teeth really well without causing bleeding or damaging gums.</li>
            <li>This is very soft and the handles design makes it easy to brush with precision.</li>
            <li>These are very soft and easy on your gums.</li>
            <li>(Pack of 3), it is the softest and most effective toothbrush that has fine long soft bristles that clean better under the gumline, and my gums around my back teeth aren&#x27;t sore anymore, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth either.</li>
            <li>Teeth are super clean and love the soft, soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a soft toothbrush, this will fit your needs.&lt;br /&gt;2)Cleans well, but not so much better than the regular toothbrush that it will make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too soft to clean your teeth!  </li>
            <li>I will never use another kind of toothbrush as long as I can get my hands on these.  </li>
            <li>It gently massages your gums, and yet, because the bristles are so fine, it also cleans your teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>It gently massages your gums, and yet, because the bristles are so fine, it also cleans your teeth very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, I&#x27;ve used these for several years and have a sparkling smile with healthy gums !</li>
            <li>These brushes are just soft enough to let me get a good brush without bleeding to death.</li>
            <li>I know several Asian people who are always looking for a brush like this, which they could get at home, but have great difficulty finding in the states.</li>
            <li>The gentle action gum massage is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Preserve - Ultra Soft toothbrush for years and much prefer it over this for its appropriate sizing and softness.</li>
            <li>This really loosens up the bristles and restores the super softness.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but dense and I get a great clean - just as if I had used an electric toothbrush, though not as harsh on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are also VERY soft, and it&#x27;s rather comfortable for my gums.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is super super soft that I have no worry about hurting my gums and teeth!</li>
            <li>I normally purchase nimbus toothbrushes witch feel great in your hands and are extra soft.</li>
            <li>The brittles is so fine it will get in between the teeth and clean the left over food out.</li>
            <li>Very gentle bristles.</li>
            <li>This brush cleans my teeth, yet is very gentle on my gums.  </li>
            <li>Its very gently</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked all over for bristles this fine and soft on store shelves.  </li>
            <li>However, I do prefer the colgate 360 extra soft ones a little more, they just feel better on my teeth and give me a better clean.</li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush very much and plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently purchased a lot more of them and have distributed them throughout my extended family.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and gentle and leaves my teeth with that squeaky clean feeling like I just came from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>The head is a nice size and the bristles are very close together, much closer than standard toothbrushes</li>
            <li>The bristles, for me, do not last for more than three weeks, and so I go through about three brushes every two months.</li>
            <li>But b/c kids&#x27; enamel is thinner and their teeth are more fragile, I would hand these toothbrushes to them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m back to purchase more.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>so I searched Amazon and found exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would go back to a manual toothbrush, but I really love this one.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that has ever given me a sensation in my gums after using it.</li>
            <li>I used to have perfect teeth that were impervious to cavities and such, but in recent times, I&#x27;ve had cavities and the most recent filling actually required a crown.</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, I was amazed.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>seller sent it very well protected and in a timely manner!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will only buy these from now on, unless something miraculously comes along thats better.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful on my teeth, can&#x27;t go wrong with these things.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more durable than regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>so they get into crevices much better than standard ones.  </li>
            <li>IT really cleans the teeth and doesn&#x27;t shred your gums!</li>
            <li>Upon first use I was hooked on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It feels like a cloud brushing against my teeth and gums, gently coaxed along by a calm breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you have food stuch, then take those out with water or with tooth pick first before brushing with this.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft and therefore smooth on gums.  </li>
            <li>My gums are much happier!</li>
            <li>so I ordered this based off of its stellar amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>The first use, I was like \\&quot;oh, my,</li>
            <li>I LOVE the simple, sleek, lightweight design of the Perio.</li>
            <li>In fact, as my Dad is a dentist himself, I&#x27;ve seen first hand the number of people who swear by the sonicare...</li>
            <li>Simply put its my favorite brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling,but it feels like a very fine brush with a lot more bristles then my mouth is used to ,frankly!It</li>
            <li>just touching the bristles for the first time I knew this was something different, as states</li>
            <li>Short and sweet:  Fantastic toothbrush, but don&#x27;t count on a color variety--</li>
            <li>Better then anything in the local stores.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed taking the toothbrushes out of the box was the size.</li>
            <li>Good for everyday and for after you visit the dentist.</li>
            <li>Even though I floss everyday, I feel this also does a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dad has always said a good toothbrush should have very soft bristles, but it seems all the other brushes today are multi-colored, multi-angled, stiff bristled things that have all kinds of great featured that really tear up your gums.</li>
            <li>I know, i sound like a commercial, but they really are different and clean better in my experience.  </li>
            <li>Very effective toothbrush, didn&#x27;t find it too hard like some people reviewed.  </li>
            <li>and they are actually in Burbank, CA, very friendly, and give these out to their clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The super soft bristles glide in between teeth to remove plaque, while being super gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>tried different types of those brushes, and those seems like the most effective, and soft enough.</li>
            <li>bristles are soft and flexible, but the tips are so fine that they get into the spaces between teeth very well</li>
            <li>my teeth feel very clean when i am done brushing with this perio brush, i only wish there was an automatic version.</li>
            <li>It actually makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>I will not use any other kind of  toothbrush.</li>
            <li>lies flat on counter top.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell though how well they clean.</li>
            <li>These clean so well and are soft like I hoped for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dr. Collins Perio brush is SO soft, doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums, and yet my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Yes, soft toothbrushes will get your teeth clean IF you purchase this brand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good toothbrush that really cleans and gets the job done without being too harsh on my gums.</li>
            <li>Good quality toothbrush, but not as soft as I expected.</li>
            <li>but I never achieved a super glossy clean with regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I am an adult and wearing my braces and these are pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Super soft, but do the cleaning trick!</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d kept better track of how long I used each one</li>
            <li>My gums are not as sore and their color looks better; more of a pink hue than red.</li>
            <li>Also, the narrow handle makes it very comfortable to hold!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;ll run towards them, anxious to be grazed by this angelic brush of good fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing has ever left my mouth feeling as clean, or as fresh-- and the feeling lasts all day.</li>
            <li>These simple, soft toothbrushes leave my teeth feeling clean and smooth every time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found super soft in stores.  </li>
            <li>Was told by my dentist to get a super soft brush to prevent damage to my gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had super sensitive bleeding gums since I was like 18-19 (26 now) and could never keep it under control.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is SUPER soft just like advertised..</li>
            <li>I was looking for a super soft bristle toothbrush and the Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrushes were just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Super soft</li>
            <li>I have always been very particular about my toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much as good as it gets, at least from what it looks like now.</li>
            <li>This is so gentle yet strong enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>They are a sturdier material (Nylon) that last longer too, so are more economical at the slightly higher initial cost.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to actually brush my teeth without being super worried and careful.  </li>
            <li>but it turns yellow quickly!</li>
            <li>I will always Only buy Dr. Collins and with Amazon they were shipped so quickly too!  </li>
            <li>I really believe she can brush with a cactus if it had enough bristles and be fine.</li>
            <li>it feels good now, instead of dreading it and trying hard not to irritate my gums.</li>
            <li>Even though they are so soft, they still last quite a long time and get everything nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My son also uses it, he has braces and gum line recession, so, he uses those brushes and it works very well for him also.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this brand.  </li>
            <li>These really help.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>They hold up really well</li>
            <li>, I went on amazon in search of a real one.</li>
            <li>very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No toothbrush ever really seemed &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; to me.</li>
            <li>Give it a try - just remember to brush gently and let the bristles do the work.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works very well for me.</li>
            <li>The tapered bristles really get in there.</li>
            <li>teeth much easier</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The Dr. Collins brush leaves your teeth much cleaner for longer and gently massages your gums.</li>
            <li>and it is working very well</li>
            <li>The bristles get between your teeth very well too.  </li>
            <li>the heck could a toothbrush incite so much excitement in consumers?&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Such a fantastic purchase.  </li>
            <li>but you might as well go buy a store brand at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like they cleaned my teeth very well</li>
            <li>I really like the way this toothbrush feels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m remineralizing my teeth and this has helped by being so gentle.</li>
            <li>If they wear well they are highly recommended!</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s my problem for not making sure the zipper is all the way closed.</li>
            <li>The designer should be fired because I really almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of how it looks.  </li>
            <li>very well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not at all gentle on the gums and</li>
            <li>These toothbrush are very flexible and would reach all places in your mouth.</li>
            <li>really DO get every part of your tooth.</li>
            <li>This is getting my teeth sooooo much cleaner, like coming out of the dentist chair everyday!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is much gentler.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to apply too much pressure when I brush, even though I try to remember not to do that.</li>
            <li>I think the price is reasonable, for a 3pack.</li>
            <li>Very nice...best toothbrush ever.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The Dr. Collins perio works really well</li>
            <li>Besides all that, the package arrived very well done and the delivery was within the combined.</li>
            <li>I sincerely don&#x27;t think that anyone who tries it would ever want to use another brush.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m still feeling that bit of sensitivity after a really in depth flossing.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Dr. Collins.</li>
            <li>thanks, I will be using it very soon.</li>
            <li>and you start noticing  how much their hurting your gums.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li>I really like the density of the bristles.  </li>
            <li>I have very fussy gums with a propensity for sensitivity and infections.  </li>
            <li>I really like these toothbrushes, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li>it so much bought it for the whole family.</li>
            <li>but most importantly it&#x27;s not extra soft</li>
            <li>These are my favorite extra soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find such a soft brush as this in stores.</li>
            <li>these bristles are baby soft and my mouth is thanking me!!!</li>
            <li>I do seem to like it very much, the bristles are very soft on the gums.</li>
            <li>I love how soft they are, yet they still clean your teeth really well without destroying your gums.  </li>
            <li>I just used my newly arrived brush for the first time.</li>
            <li>It is soft, it is just the right size and the bristles</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and make it easy to not only brush your teeth, but your gums too.</li>
            <li>I just received these brushes in the mail a second ago and was a bit excited to test it out.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, I don&#x27;t feel that sore/ sensitive sensation as I usually feel with the 360.</li>
            <li>I like it better than any other toothbrush, and have sent one of them to my ex-husband to try.</li>
            <li>Immediately ordered more along with the vanilla mint toothpaste (that does not make me gag like other mints).  </li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t look like a race car, it doesn&#x27;t have multicolored bristles, but it cleans your teeth better than any other brush I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>tried ABC, ORAL B, COLGATE and many other brands</li>
            <li>Seems much better than the other toothbrushes I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>The bottoms get gunked with toothpaste more so than other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Finally, I&#x27;m still going strong on my first Perio toothbush and it&#x27;s been four whole months since I began using it, and not a single splayed bristle in sight.</li>
            <li>Very soft, yet efficient and effective at cleaning and getting into tight spots.  </li>
            <li>so I have to clean it out occasionally and</li>
            <li>You actually feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I started recently having some problems, my teeth becoming sensitive.</li>
            <li>My teeth actually feel clean after using it and my gums don&#x27;t feel assaulted.</li>
            <li>I recently got braces and needed a toothbrush that would help clean and wouldn&#x27;t lossed the braces.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft, I love this toothbrush and I will continue to use it for as long as I can.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if I could have chosen the colors of the brushes that arrived, but that is only a minor annoyance.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and most toothbrushes I buy just aren&#x27;t soft enough even if they say so on the package.</li>
            <li>only thing I like is the needle/like edges of the bristles, witch is good for cleaning gum&#x27;s, for no longer than 30 sec, apparently ;))).</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s great and any other &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brushes feel super hard.</li>
            <li>I recently had gum surgery and got a special &amp;#34;ultra soft&amp;#34; toothbrush from the periodontist.</li>
            <li>that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, these actually last a good 2 to 3 months, not the typical 30 days.</li>
            <li>They are soft and yet they do get my teeth very clean, that is as long as the bristles are not worn....</li>
            <li>so much softer than normal brushes.  </li>
            <li>You can feel the difference the first time, so soft for how well the brush works/scrubs.</li>
            <li>an\d a nice small head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the first time I used these it felt soo soft</li>
            <li>and it was quite soft and noted that the bristles did have a needle-like shape that would be helpful in getting between tight teeth (like my own) and below the gum line.</li>
            <li>Easy on the gums, cleans the teeth well and lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>This brush feels so much better than my previous toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you really need a soft brush that lasts a reasonable period of time, this is the one.</li>
            <li>There are smaller version of similar to these, they are ok.</li>
            <li>Fortunately my gums have healed and I probably don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;ultra soft&amp;#34; anymore, but this may well not be soft enough for you if you are immediately post-op or have ongoing gum issues.</li>
            <li>The main advantage of this toothbrush is that the brushes are made of</li>
            <li>To get a halfway decent floss job done, I&#x27;m in front of the mirror for 10 minutes after they&#x27;ve gone to bed going through all the things I could</li>
            <li>so I still have many of them left over a year later.</li>
            <li>There only a few times in your life where you come across something so good</li>
            <li>I can say there are no over the counter brushes that are as soft, with as thin bristles and do a great job at cleaning teeth like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>these are very soft and gentle, yet get the job done.</li>
            <li>I find the Perio toothbrush very soft &amp; gentle on the gum.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and work very well for her.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles, much softer than oral-b.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and gums was was looking for a toothbrush that is gentle to use.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think a special toothbrush was going to make that big of a difference on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>The bristles are VERY SOFT and don&#x27;t irritate used it after i came from the dentist.!</li>
            <li>I am starting to see some gumline recession due to my overzealous use of that sonicare darling (seriously, do not use it more than once a day and very gently at that.)  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I buy them in a pack of three and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend giving this toothbrush a try if you are experiencing bleeding or receding gums.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m hooked, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll ever use, highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>would recommend these to everyone, despite their high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe if they&#x27;ve done a major cleaning at the dentist and a professional hygienist has hovered over you with his/her assortment of sharp metal picks, hooks, and scraper, but you can&#x27;t do this kind of floss job with a strand at home.</li>
            <li>WOW this is the toothbrush I have been looking for!!</li>
            <li>I am glad I decided to try out a brand name I am not familiar with.</li>
            <li>However, I might be able to go a little bit longer with these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to explain if you haven&#x27;t used the brush.  </li>
            <li>But those are perfect, and the price isn&#x27;t bad also.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does a great job brushing my teeth and its not to expensive</li>
            <li>It is soft but cleans really well.  </li>
            <li>It is really soft, yet cleans very well.</li>
            <li>It is soft and gentle on your teeth, but I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the handle.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who wants a soft toothbrush for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>so I really needed &#x27;truly&#x27; soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is soft but cleans very well.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>You can feels the bristles really getting in between your teeth because they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li>Works really well, does the job of cleaning without hurting the soft tissues.</li>
            <li>It for sensitive teeth and it brushes gently.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and gentle on my gums yet</li>
            <li>Oh goodness, they really are soft.  </li>
            <li>but I can no longer use it daily so, in full blown panic mode, I&#x27;ve been searching for a really soft toothbrush, trying drugstore brand after drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li>The narrow bristle tips do seem to get between teeth better than others.</li>
            <li>I ordered a bunch of different soft tip toothbrushes just to try different brands, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use mouthwash or any kind of spinning toothbrush anymore, because that also made my teeth extremely sensitive in the past.</li>
            <li>I bought a few and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>, i normally switch it out every 2 months or so...</li>
            <li>I was of the opinion that pretty much all brand name toothbrushes were the same.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t scrub away everything like a normal toothbrush would.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad toothbrush by any means, but it&#x27;s really not a soft brush.</li>
            <li>Tapered bristles make a huge difference, and I noticed the brush doesn&#x27;t get super hard after a few weeks like most brushes.  </li>
            <li>Other than that its perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>But went back to normal right after.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Although there was a tendency towards fewer sites with gingival abrasion with the a tapered toothbrush, it was less effective than the a regular toothbrush in the removal of plaque biofilm and reduction of bleeding.\\</li>
            <li>So I started looking for soft brushes and I bought different toothbrushes for toddlers that are describes as \\&quot;super soft\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I mean my mouth feels amazing after using this brush.</li>
            <li>I guess many people haven&#x27;t used any other soft toothbrushes for comparison, but this toothbrush is not that soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also makes me see how all these other toothpastes are really marketed with their bell and whistles just to suck more money out of consumers when ALL we need is a standard brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my only brush in the house right now.  </li>
            <li>I found it very abrasive to my gums and the bristles are so long that I can&#x27;t fit the toothbrush into the space to reach the back teeth.  </li>
            <li>They live up to their claim.</li>
            <li>I have it for 4 months and it looks brand new.</li>
            <li>Been using it for months, and still looks new.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new tooth brush and came across this one in my search.</li>
            <li>This is my new toothbrush for life.</li>
            <li>new--</li>
            <li>Like it because of narrow head and soft bristles - just ok toothbrush</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered, I&#x27;ve got 3 hot pink toothbrushs</li>
            <li>You have to change them every three months or so, but I now wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, particularly the name brands found in grocery and drug stores, which are complete garbage.</li>
            <li>This product is really solid, much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I had been using a soft bristled toothbrush for years and never found one that really felt soft.  </li>
            <li>When brushing not only did I not feel irritation in the slightest, but I really felt the cleaning power, they really get in there and do work.</li>
            <li>, really soft and decently priced&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>then it was time for something new as my gum lines were getting very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>and they are very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush.  </li>
            <li>BUT this toothbrush is waaay easier on my gums and teeth, as i have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles that don&#x27;t hurt your gums.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are VERY soft, softer than any tooth brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>These are very soft.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a very soft toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My gums are very sensitive and I needed a toothbrush that would not leave me with irritated gums.</li>
            <li>very soft.</li>
            <li>This plain looking toothbrush actually feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a search for a super soft toothbrush for a long time as I tend to brush away my enamel with the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; brushes that I&#x27;ve used throughout the years.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Actually makes brushing your teeth enjoyable, and I noticed my teeth felt cleaner than after using other toobrushes.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>I searched to get a soft toothbrush and bam!</li>
            <li>I have this toothbrush to thank for it because I haven&#x27;t made any other significant changes.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition to the only one color, these were evidently custom printed for a Dr. Suzman (phone number also imprinted on the handle).</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are so soft!  </li>
            <li>On this brush density pretty regular for the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; type of toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>After opening the packaging for the first time, I thought it looked kind of weird.</li>
            <li>I want very soft one, but not too soft that it won&#x27;t do its job.</li>
            <li>Since it wasn&#x27;t a name brand apparently no one was interested.  </li>
            <li>, they felt kind of weak.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried soft brushes before and always end up going back to a harder brush just because the soft ones never feel like they clean very well.</li>
            <li>Never thought I could be in love or have strong feeling about any toothbrush, but I really am crazy about these.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and initially it does not feel like it is doing much.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that I can get around my back teeth easily because of the smaller hear and bristles that seem to reach further in.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes because they&#x27;re super soft, which is what I need and can be difficult to find.</li>
            <li>And the bristles are so soft that it actually feels good to brush your teeth; all those store toothbrushes that say &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; on them still always felt very hard to me.</li>
            <li>I have no dental troubles at all except for using too hard brushes for most my adult life hitch</li>
            <li>More effective at removing stains than even the hard bristle premium brushes (which are impossible to find now), and these are super soft!</li>
            <li>It cleans really well for having such soft bristles.</li>
            <li>This brush also lasts much longer than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Anyone that needs a soft toothbrush will appreciate this one...</li>
            <li>B00206DXQ0 Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Toothpaste (4.4 oz]]</li>
            <li>when I used this my teeth feel sensitive, but I have never had sensitivity on my teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth are highly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about time somebody improved on the old fashioned toothbrush, and with this one, they did.</li>
            <li>Thanks to ppl who came up with such brushes.</li>
            <li>My dentist told me to use soft bristles yrs ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have an electric professional oral b brush, and I truly doubt I will ever use it again.  </li>
            <li>Soft on the gums, but cleans my teeth perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has extremely soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>Like flossing while you brush because the tiny bristles really get in there between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Just as described; this toothbrush is soft so it doesn&#x27;t harm the gums.  </li>
            <li>I realize now they were never that soft to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how soft it is.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the (standard) shipping was notably fast, faster than packages I ordered before it.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think that bristles this soft would get the job done well</li>
            <li>I would reccommend using this toothbrush for anyone with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I think that 1) comes with the territory for a soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and receding gums, my dentist&#x27;s office suggested I lay off the Sonicare..</li>
            <li>They are truly soft and remain soft for quite some time.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and these bristles did not hurt my gums or teeth.  </li>
            <li>SO SOFT -</li>
            <li>My gums were receding and my teeth were getting sensitive</li>
            <li>Extra soft bristles gently cleans without abrasion for sensitive root surfaces.</li>
            <li>anyway.. if you don&#x27;t mind a manual toothbrush, and have needs for a soft head, this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li>In addition, the design of the head and bristles do make the difference; I feel that the bristles get in between my teeth and eject food particles that my old 360 did not do well, and I can reach and brush my wisdom</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li>My dentist used to provide the sensitive style that you could not find over the counter</li>
            <li>If you have sore gums, have had oral surgery or have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I keep it sanitized with a Dr. Tung&#x27;s natural toothbrush cap.</li>
            <li>So soft, and almost no bleeding when i brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended i get a soft bristle brush and brush horizontally than vertically.</li>
            <li>Soft, durable - no complaints.  </li>
            <li>Soft tooth brush</li>
            <li>and I will have them for a long time ;)</li>
            <li>I can tell that it is getting around every tooth because it is soft.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a child&#x27;s soft would work as well, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>But not so soft that they are ineffective.  </li>
            <li>It is really soft</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gems and teeth</li>
            <li>The problem is that the head is very big and the bristles very dense.</li>
            <li>My gums are sensitive, so I&#x27;d been looking for a soft brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt they were too soft, but my dentist convinced me to stay with them to protect tooth enamel</li>
            <li>Soft bristles</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a week now and brushing now hurts every time, and my whole mouth is actually aching as I write this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have sensitive teeth but haven&#x27;t had any problems with bleeding gums or sensitivity there before.</li>
            <li>soft.</li>
            <li>This Dr Collins Perio toothbrush is identical to the extremely soft toothbrushes my dentist always gives me.  </li>
            <li>The Dr. Collins Perio toothbrushes ARE soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is what soft bristles should feel like.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth or receeding gum line, this is the tooth brush for you.</li>
            <li>soft</li>
            <li>I need soft bristles that don&#x27;t scratch my gums and make them bleed.  </li>
            <li>Dentist recommended a soft brush but didn&#x27;t specify a brand, so I chose this one.</li>
            <li>Soft feel and</li>
            <li>He loves how soft they are.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth &amp; used to get OralB</li>
            <li>Even when they are labeled Soft (they are not).&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>The so-called soft bristles were still scratchy on my teeth and didn&#x27;t help with my receding gums.  </li>
            <li>, they are incredibly soft and I don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive mouth with them.</li>
            <li>I always look for soft toothbrush because I have to, or my gums would bleed.</li>
            <li>She was surprised to learn that it was because of the toothbrush I was using.</li>
            <li>These brushes are quite soft and goes between the teeth.</li>
            <li>sensitive gums makes be a Dr. Collins Perio brush convert.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and tender...</li>
            <li>I found these as an alternative to the sonicare which totally fixed me about 15 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare now makes a soft brush</li>
            <li>I use a Walgreens brand soft toothbrush now</li>
            <li>But I finally was given a softer bristled toothbrush by my dental hygeniest called Plak Smacker Ultra Gentle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll grab an old fashioned tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this inexpensive pack of 3 soft toothbrushes based on reviews.  </li>
            <li>The bristles themselves are so soft, it&#x27;s like velvet rubbing on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother the areas of my teeth where the dentin is showing.  </li>
            <li>This one is so soft.  </li>
            <li>Soft but the bristle arrangement works well for cleaning, even between teeth and at the gum line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo soft and the tapered bristles tickle.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is soft as advertised while still brushing the teeth well.</li>
            <li>my 3-pack came filled with all green ones.</li>
            <li>I needed a soft toothbrush with just bristles no plastic thingy&#x27;s or anything on them...</li>
            <li>A truely soft bristled brush.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence and need a soft brush, try it.</li>
            <li>It is much, much softer than the \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I never knew that brushing my teeth could be painless, which isn&#x27;t something an adult should have to say.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m undergoing head and neck radiotherapy and was looking for a soft toothbrush that wouldn&#x27;t irriate my sore gums caused by the treatment.  </li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use soft toothbrushes in my house because I never thought they would work well.</li>
            <li>There are a ton of soft bristles on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I used these for a few months and when I went back to the dentist, my numbers were mostly 1 and 2s vs 3s.</li>
            <li>Since it seems there is only one model of extra soft toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever been able to find in stores, one that&#x27;s really not all that soft anyhow</li>
            <li>I started using Dr. Collins toothbrushes a few years back and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are amazingly soft and comfortable yet manage to sweep away debris that my stiff electric can miss.  </li>
            <li>But... i found the sonicare and back then they guaranteed right on the box, to cure gingivitis and peridontal issues or your money back.  </li>
            <li>it is a bit stiff with no curves to make holding it comfortable.  </li>
            <li>My dentist has to special order extra soft toothbrushes and recommends only extra soft brushes.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to push hard, just gentle circular motions gets everything clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the nimbus which is also available on Amazon, but they poked my gums and caused my entire jaw to ache due to the gum pain.</li>
            <li>To me it seems much softer than other brushes I have tried and much easier on the gums, I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I felt like the bristles were really getting my teeth clean with the least amount of wear and tear.  </li>
            <li>This tooth brush was very soft and easy on my delicate gums.</li>
            <li>I usually buy extra soft toothbrushes, but this one is way better.</li>
            <li>So I have searched high and low for a soft bristled toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I prefer soft tooth brushes and these toothbrushes are highly recommended by several forums.</li>
            <li>I have bought extra soft toothbrushes from oral b at the store but these bristles are softer; however due to their compactness, my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t still have the box, but I think the one that arrived may have said medium or hard on the top, whereas the one pictured only says soft.  </li>
            <li>They are soft enough not to irritate my mouth, which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>apparently its not going to be as soft as &amp;#34;GUM&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Only problem is that it needed to be replaced after about a month of usage instead of two to three months for a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>they are soft, small bristles so they can sneak in between your teeth and clean out the food and what not.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old prefers these over any other tooth brush because they are so incredibly gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>My husband felt the same when he used his new brush.  </li>
            <li>I enthusiastically gave one of my three new brushes to my partner, who said the same thing.    </li>
            <li>My only concern is that it looks like the \\&quot;filaments\\&quot; might eventually get loose as they look a bit flimsy and sometimes crooked, but apparently they are supposed to last longer than standard nylon bristles that most brushes have.  </li>
            <li>I have been giving these toothbrushes out to my family and the only complaint is that now that their teeth feel so clean they really notice when they need to brush again.</li>
            <li>As soon as I started brushing, I said \\&quot;aaahhhhh\\&quot; - I have sensitive teeth/gums, and I have had no luck finding extra soft toothbrushes in the store.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, but they last much longer than regular extra soft brushes, which seem to splay out after a couple brushes.</li>
            <li>But no where near the pain or discomfort of a professional cleaning or traditional flossing.</li>
            <li>My gums are slowly turning a healthy pinkish again instead of red and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These have very soft bristles, in fact even softer than the children&#x27;s version of this same brand.  </li>
            <li>very soft ,especially after they tighten or changed ,this is recommended</li>
            <li>This brush is perfect if you want a soft brush but are unhappy with the job that ordinary toothbrushes do.</li>
            <li>It still cleans like no other</li>
            <li>FINALLY a toothbrush that actually IS soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first use my gums did feel a bit sore, like some other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li>Super-soft bristles like no other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My dentist said i need to use a extra soft toothbrush!</li>
            <li>These brushes have very soft and gentle bristles and will not clean adult teeth well.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is very soft for the first few weeks, after that it starts to harden up a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My tongue keeps rubbing my teeth because they feel so slick and clean.  </li>
            <li>But after a few days I became accustomed and realized that regular soft are super</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to extra soft toothbrushes from my dentist due to receeding gums.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extra-soft but yet firm enough to thoroughly clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy Oral B , but even the extra soft oral B brushes do not compare to these in terms of softness.</li>
            <li>I will now only use this brand and the Colgate 360 Sensitive Pro.</li>
            <li>He indicated that it was crucial for me to use an ultra soft toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have lost some teeth and needed something really soft on the gums for daily use.</li>
            <li>Of course you still have to floss and use mouthwash, but WOW this makes such a difference!</li>
            <li>My dentist told me to get a extra soft toothbrush, this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I am sticking to my Colgate Extra Soft brushes.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, but just angled enough to get between the gumline and tooth.  </li>
            <li>I got the set of three thinking that if is soft it wont last...</li>
            <li>I was using a soft brush prior to finding these</li>
            <li>Brushing with my former toothbrush brand was uncomfortable, and if I tried to brush more gently, my teeth didn&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li>I only bought this brush because I was buying a sensitive toothpaste, and stumbled upon it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I promise you if you try this toothbrush you will never go back to your old toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>Over the years using only soft brushes I have undermined my dental roots.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are extra soft and seem durable.</li>
            <li>If you use an extra soft brush you must try this one.  </li>
            <li>I am confused as to how this product received so many 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crazy how good this brush is.</li>
            <li>My dentist always yells at me for brushing too hard and always gives me a super soft toothbrush at the end of my visits.  </li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I was looking for: a slight crook in the handle, a tapered head, and very soft bristles in a flat arrangement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally sold on this new product I just recently learned about.</li>
            <li>Before, I&#x27;d tend to \\&quot;forget\\&quot; to brush my teeth (really, avoiding brushing) because it didn&#x27;t seem to do much or last very long.</li>
            <li>However, being able to fine an extra soft that was not a child&#x27;s toothbrush was annoying.</li>
            <li>head is smaller than what is standard on regular grocery store brushes but after getting used to it, I find that the small size is much better for getting back into those rear molars and inside surfaces.</li>
            <li>Hard to get excited about toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I need to brush 4-5 times a day due to my Invisalign and my mouth was taking a beating from that much exposure to my electric brush.  </li>
            <li>Where other toothbrushes have been rough on my gums, these toothbrushes have improved the health of my gums, even in a spot where there was mild receding occurring.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive gums or gum recession from excessively hard brushing, this toothbrush is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>You really start realizing how bad these popular toothbrushes are when you have something like braces(which</li>
            <li>Polyester bristles are a major improvement over standard nylon brushes.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy a different style of toothbrush every time, then I got a prototype of one of these a few years ago as a free gift for buying a rather expensive mild-flavor sensitivity toothpaste &amp; now I won&#x27;t use any other kind of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>yet firm enough to feel right.  </li>
            <li>(and bigger, those are kind of small, they designed for a small mouth)</li>
            <li>I use it at least twice daily and it leaves my mouth feeling tingly and clean.  </li>
            <li>Super hard tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>They are a tad pricy, but the bristles don&#x27;t wear out or fall out as fast as they do in a typical toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Soft and last long.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not going to pretend I&#x27;m one of those ultra conscientious and fastidious dental hygienists that brushes and flosses completely 3 times a day, but I do brush every single day.</li>
            <li>You can really see up close the tiny filaments at the ends, and some of them curl slightly at the tips.  </li>
            <li>I normally have an unfortunate layer of biofilm on the top of my teeth next to the gum line that even flossing couldn&#x27;t tackle, but this brush makes it easier for me to scrub harder without damaging or wearing away my gums at the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles but very long lasting, Most people brush too hard with brushes that are too stiff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite effective, &amp; I believe that being overzealous in the past with Crest Spinbrushes and similar products that have hard bristles caused my teeth to become sensitive over time, so be careful.</li>
            <li>challenge I have with this particular order is that they didn&#x27;t say that with the description of \\&quot;colors vary\\&quot; that it meant I would get all 3 the same color - dark</li>
            <li>and I start thinking of replacing them only after the longer filaments start getting bent a little, so it depends on how much and how vigorously I use them.</li>
            <li>Needed a very soft brush for ulcerated mouth due to chemo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, gentle, delicate and yet knows how to do a proper cleaning because it does not hurt the gums.</li>

            <li> If there&#x27;s any truth to these not being as effective as less-soft ones in getting rid of plaque, I&#x27;m just keeping a tougher grade toothbrush on hand to use (reluctantly) now and again.</li>

            <li> I bought 3 more.</li>
            <li> most toothbrush&#x27;s have their namebrand on them.</li>
            <li> I found one I like even better (softer and gentler on perio gums), but this one was my favorite until then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The even better toothbrush is the Nimbus Microfine:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LB8J06?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00</li>
            <li> , sensitivity was gone for me in two days and keeps my mouth feeling much better than Sensodyne ever did.</li>
            <li> This brush does not hurt my gums and cleans better than the electric brush I had.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> Love that you can buy them in a three-pack.</li>
            <li> I will gladly reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad i did.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to replace your brush when they get worn out.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best tooth brushes out there!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully these will help him to have better hygene with this.</li>
            <li> I wish it comes in in more colors.</li>

            <li> Glad I looked here.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes.</li>

            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but I can feel it working into the cracks btwn my teeth more.</li>
            <li> Better than anything I can get in the store, even the health food store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bristlings of softiness anti-irritates my gums and makes my enamelsweepings most pleasurable.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I now find my gums feel much better too.</li>
            <li> But it is somewhat of a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrushes she gives me</li>
            <li> I was very happy to finally find something like this, and it was cheaper for a pack of 3 than you&#x27;d pay for 1 or 2 toothbrushes at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I tried Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush and love it.  </li>
            <li> Very happy and will continue to order these in the future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This was the best deal (cheaper than the gas to drive from store to store) &amp; will definitely refer it</li>
            <li> Much better than the ones i&#x27;ve bought from the store.</li>
            <li> Simply the very best if you have gum problems.</li>
            <li> After using many &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes I was still having issues with receding gums.</li>

            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> glad I got the 3 pack</li>
            <li> I have receding gums as most people that find there way to specialized tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I will buy more to have on hand for guests and travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve all the top electric brushes</li>
            <li> i am totally pleased with the purchase.</li>

            <li> my dentist said I was doing much better.</li>
            <li> Except I brush with toothpaste, not butter, most of the time.  </li>
            <li> this is even better.  </li>
            <li> I really love them.  </li>

            <li> I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It is better than some.  </li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase, and after I use up all three brushes, I&#x27;ll definitely consider purchasing some more, as this product is great for the price.</li>
            <li> Really nice, and clean below the gumline without harming the gums.</li>
            <li> These are pretty much the best manual toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> Teeth feel really clean afterwards too!</li>
            <li> this tooth brush plus arm &amp; hammer(floss and tooth picks) is all i need for a clean mouth!</li>
            <li> However, coming from someone who has never had a cavity, these clean just fine while my gums remain happily intact ;)</li>
            <li> I use an electric tooth brush because I like for my mouth to feel clean and this toothbrush is prefect!</li>
            <li> I thank the other reviewers for their excellent comments in helping me to find this outstanding product.</li>

            <li> Really does a great job between the teeth, and also is so gentle on the gums but cleans the gumline</li>
            <li> just feels different,and in a good way!i would definitely buy some more.</li>
            <li> far these brushes are surprisingly durable, and a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li> I heard that soft tooth brushes are the best to use, but It always seemed to me that soft bristles wouldn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have that wonderfully sparkling clean shine and slippery feel, everyday...</li>
            <li> I originally received one for free</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and smooth after use.  </li>
            <li> After the first brushing I could tell the difference - my teeth had never felt more smooth.</li>
            <li> I thought the super soft toothbrushes from Gum was good...</li>
            <li> So the hunt was on for a good quality super soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft on your gums and gives them a great massage, soft on your teeth, the bristles are sturdy yet incredibly flexible, and it rests flat on counter tops</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> My original review still holds.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I gave these one star after first buying them more than a year ago.</li>
            <li> Years ago I was told they were receding some, so that&#x27;s an improvement, and I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> Well, Dr. Collins is the most gentle of all!</li>
            <li> No matter how long I brush my teeth, my gums feel really great when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get excited by a toothbrush</li>
            <li> Dentist has been wanting me to get surgery for some time to give me more gum where its receding, but I keep putting it off because I&#x27;m not in pain thanks to these!</li>
            <li> For the first I can brush my teeth without worrying to bleed. :)))))</li>
            <li> Smile!</li>
            <li> After a month, I have noticed a significant improvement of my gums.</li>
            <li> But I will certainly keep buying this brush until something better becomes available.</li>
            <li> The fine tips clean really thoroughly without causing more gum recession or bleeding.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came with some kind of tongue cleaner on the back side, but other than that, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product, extra soft brushes, brush well without harming the gums.</li>
            <li> I have gum line recession, so I chose those brushes to gently clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> After brushing my teeth feel squeaky clean like they do after having my teeth cleaned and polished at the dentists office.</li>
            <li> you know your teeth are clean without ripping up your gums in the process.</li>
            <li> And anything to make your brushing experience more comfortable to help you brush longer is what really matters in the end.</li>
            <li> my teeth felt soooo clean...</li>
            <li> polyester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and seems to reach areas between teeth and gums better than most.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> Extra Soft brushes from my dentist (which were awesome),</li>
            <li> They are soft, the angle is perfect for getting to molars, and the design is simple.</li>
            <li> Much more effective than regular</li>
            <li> I always thought you needed power tools and hooks to clean teeth like dentists do.</li>
            <li> Not so with this brush; my teeth feel polished and clean</li>
            <li> And when it&#x27;s all said and done, I know it&#x27;s not all clean because there are places</li>
            <li> After brushing, my mouth feels sparkling clean, so I plan to continue using these unless my dentist indicates they have caused a problem.</li>
            <li> you get floss like clean feeling.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t harm my gume; helps me clean insides of cheeks and surface of tongue, etc.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to write home about.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you don&#x27;t get that good initial clean.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to brush too hard and these are the perfect answer for that.</li>
            <li> Amazing, soooo super soft!</li>
            <li> For timings of great lengths, my past enamelsweepers have most harmfully irritatinglies my gums.</li>
            <li> Past generations of criticreviewers praise most excellentingly the feather-like softiness of the enamelsweepers, so I with interest much great orderbought</li>
            <li> The soft bristles feels amazing on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> my teeth still feel super clean.  </li>
            <li> I have a permanent retainer affixed to my front teeth, top and bottom and this toothbrush makes up for the fact that I can&#x27;t floss very well between the wires.       </li>
            <li> The claims are true...</li>
            <li> Full sized head saves on brushing time.</li>
            <li> They do a better job and are gentle on gums.</li>
            <li> This is the softest, most gentle toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> When it came time to replace the brush, I tried to find the same one and couldn&#x27;t, but I thought this would be a good substitute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered a full stock of them for my bathroom backups.</li>
            <li> The reviews singing the praises were true.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have really nice soft bristles.</li>
            <li> The most immediate thing I noticed about this brush was how gentle it is to your gums.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good toothbrush as the stores usually only carry two or three brands.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this brush gently massages my gums &amp; teeth</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, with a bristle configuration that helps get in between teeth as well as gums.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Answer Periowash Alcohol-free Mouthwash, Cool Mint, 16-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Not really so bad...</li>
            <li> These tooth brush is soft on the gum and still brushes your teeth pretty good.</li>
            <li> The gentle clean is well worth the cost in my opinion, as keeping your teeth and gums healthy is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Bristles are long which go into the space between teeth to clean out good</li>
            <li> so it does get your teeth very clean but is still very gentle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great, one step away from velvet, and hasn&#x27;t made my gums bleed once like other brands do.</li>
            <li> Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush is as close as we have been able to find anywhere and possibly even better than what we were using before.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are comfy however a tad smaller than a regular brush but does excellent.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is oft for sensitive gums and is good for anyone who wants to protect their gums and the enamel on their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles do not warp quickly and the bristles retain their shape well.</li>
            <li> great soft brush for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes I have ever used, I have been using them for about 3 years now and would never go back to regular ones.</li>
            <li> and I find it adequate.</li>
            <li> I will be buying many more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy them since at the time of my first purchase</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for better oral care.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really makes cleaning that area easy as the bristles fit right into the teeth crevices.</li>
            <li> It really gets em squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fabulously clean and polished- better than the clean you get with a sonic brush and light years ahead of standard brushes.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I was expecting a GOOD brush, but I was surprised to find out its an AMAZING brush... takes a lil longer to use than the sonicare, but my teeth and gums are actually cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle was pretty comfortable, though.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and the bristles are nice and soft and fit under the gum line without doing any damage to the tissues.</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would be so excited over a toothbrush, but these are so different than the run of the mill drugstore kind.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft, as our dentist has recommended, and they seem to get below the gumline and clean between the teeth better than any toothbrush you&#x27;ll find in the store.  </li>
            <li> very fine and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it feels and how clean my mouth felt after brushing!</li>
            <li> this toothbrush has sharp fine brissles  soft good to scrape off all the plaque I love it</li>
            <li> Having had sore gums and some Perio problems I thought it was time to try some new products to better care for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great brush leaves mouth feeling deep cleaned, the way normal tooth brushes can not do.  </li>
            <li> WOW finally here is a Perio toothbrush for older adults that actually is wonderful to use.</li>
            <li> It is just want I needed - my only regret is that it took so long to find the perfect toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I replace my toothbrushes every 3 months but could easily use this one for much longer.  </li>
            <li> I am going through chemo and my gums are very tender and bleed easily.  </li>
            <li> it is very soft and I feel it cleans better than the toothbrush found in the stores</li>
            <li> This is perfect - the head is big enough and the bristles really seem to clean well despite their softness.  </li>
            <li> finally found these toothbrushes after some browsing, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love how soft the bristles are!</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean and the bristles don&#x27;t bend or splay as easily as on regular toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far so good, it&#x27;s very soft</li>
            <li> The fine bristles really do get between my teeth, and they massage my gums, too.</li>
            <li> I wanted something gentle for my gums, and these fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the 10-pack of ABC toothbrushes that I purchased from Amazon a few months ago, these aren&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li> They are gentle on my gums and do a fabulous job on cleaning my teeth/</li>
            <li> and wow is it fantastic!  </li>
            <li> If it was a soft bristle, it would not be able to push all the way through the spacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so everything has been more sensitive since then.  </li>
            <li> Im always picking up \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes at many stores &amp; NEVER found a truly soft one.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleans better than the rest and it is feather soft on the gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different toothbrushes over the years, never have I used one as comfortable as Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I always used soft toothbrushes, but these are so much better than you can get in the toothbrush section in the store.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price</li>
            <li> I hope a long long time because this is the best performing toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothbrush it did feel pretty good, but afterwards my gums felt like I&#x27;d brushed with razorblades.</li>
            <li> Cleans between teeth better than my old sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I use a sonic toothbrush at night, but I can&#x27;t use it more than once a day, or my teeth get sensitive.</li>
            <li> You get 3 tooth brush in the pack and they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s actually better than OralB, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> I hope to keep my gums healthy until I die of old age.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> It makes it fun to brush.</li>
            <li> I actually could see and feel better clean the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually excited by the prospect of having this clean feeling being a part of my daily routine without all the time, effort, and hassle to get less than ideal results.</li>
            <li> and you really feel a different kind of clean feeling after brushing with this</li>
            <li> Super soft and easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> I keep extra toothbrushes for all kinds of reasons and I really like the products that Dr. Collins makes, they are all pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, the head of the toothbrush is perfectly sized for my relatively small palate.</li>
            <li> If you want a clean mouth and gentle bristles that</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes clean teeth really well without causing bleeding or damaging gums.</li>
            <li> This is very soft and the handles design makes it easy to brush with precision.</li>
            <li> These are very soft and easy on your gums.</li>
            <li> (Pack of 3), it is the softest and most effective toothbrush that has fine long soft bristles that clean better under the gumline, and my gums around my back teeth aren&#x27;t sore anymore, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth either.</li>
            <li> Teeth are super clean and love the soft, soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a soft toothbrush, this will fit your needs.&lt;br /&gt;2)Cleans well, but not so much better than the regular toothbrush that it will make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too soft to clean your teeth!  </li>
            <li> I will never use another kind of toothbrush as long as I can get my hands on these.  </li>
            <li> It gently massages your gums, and yet, because the bristles are so fine, it also cleans your teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> It gently massages your gums, and yet, because the bristles are so fine, it also cleans your teeth very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, I&#x27;ve used these for several years and have a sparkling smile with healthy gums !</li>
            <li> These brushes are just soft enough to let me get a good brush without bleeding to death.</li>
            <li> I know several Asian people who are always looking for a brush like this, which they could get at home, but have great difficulty finding in the states.</li>
            <li> The gentle action gum massage is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Preserve - Ultra Soft toothbrush for years and much prefer it over this for its appropriate sizing and softness.</li>
            <li> This really loosens up the bristles and restores the super softness.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but dense and I get a great clean - just as if I had used an electric toothbrush, though not as harsh on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are also VERY soft, and it&#x27;s rather comfortable for my gums.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is super super soft that I have no worry about hurting my gums and teeth!</li>
            <li> I normally purchase nimbus toothbrushes witch feel great in your hands and are extra soft.</li>
            <li> The brittles is so fine it will get in between the teeth and clean the left over food out.</li>
            <li> Very gentle bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush cleans my teeth, yet is very gentle on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Its very gently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked all over for bristles this fine and soft on store shelves.  </li>
            <li> However, I do prefer the colgate 360 extra soft ones a little more, they just feel better on my teeth and give me a better clean.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush very much and plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased a lot more of them and have distributed them throughout my extended family.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft and gentle and leaves my teeth with that squeaky clean feeling like I just came from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> The head is a nice size and the bristles are very close together, much closer than standard toothbrushes</li>
            <li> The bristles, for me, do not last for more than three weeks, and so I go through about three brushes every two months.</li>
            <li> But b/c kids&#x27; enamel is thinner and their teeth are more fragile, I would hand these toothbrushes to them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m back to purchase more.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> so I searched Amazon and found exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would go back to a manual toothbrush, but I really love this one.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that has ever given me a sensation in my gums after using it.</li>
            <li> I used to have perfect teeth that were impervious to cavities and such, but in recent times, I&#x27;ve had cavities and the most recent filling actually required a crown.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, I was amazed.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> seller sent it very well protected and in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will only buy these from now on, unless something miraculously comes along thats better.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful on my teeth, can&#x27;t go wrong with these things.</li>
            <li> It seems to be more durable than regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> so they get into crevices much better than standard ones.  </li>
            <li> IT really cleans the teeth and doesn&#x27;t shred your gums!</li>
            <li> Upon first use I was hooked on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It feels like a cloud brushing against my teeth and gums, gently coaxed along by a calm breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you have food stuch, then take those out with water or with tooth pick first before brushing with this.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft and therefore smooth on gums.  </li>
            <li> My gums are much happier!</li>
            <li> so I ordered this based off of its stellar amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> The first use, I was like \\&quot;oh, my,</li>
            <li> I LOVE the simple, sleek, lightweight design of the Perio.</li>
            <li> In fact, as my Dad is a dentist himself, I&#x27;ve seen first hand the number of people who swear by the sonicare...</li>
            <li> Simply put its my favorite brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling,but it feels like a very fine brush with a lot more bristles then my mouth is used to ,frankly!It</li>
            <li> just touching the bristles for the first time I knew this was something different, as states</li>
            <li> Short and sweet:  Fantastic toothbrush, but don&#x27;t count on a color variety--</li>
            <li> Better then anything in the local stores.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed taking the toothbrushes out of the box was the size.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday and for after you visit the dentist.</li>
            <li> Even though I floss everyday, I feel this also does a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dad has always said a good toothbrush should have very soft bristles, but it seems all the other brushes today are multi-colored, multi-angled, stiff bristled things that have all kinds of great featured that really tear up your gums.</li>
            <li> I know, i sound like a commercial, but they really are different and clean better in my experience.  </li>
            <li> Very effective toothbrush, didn&#x27;t find it too hard like some people reviewed.  </li>
            <li> and they are actually in Burbank, CA, very friendly, and give these out to their clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The super soft bristles glide in between teeth to remove plaque, while being super gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> tried different types of those brushes, and those seems like the most effective, and soft enough.</li>
            <li> bristles are soft and flexible, but the tips are so fine that they get into the spaces between teeth very well</li>
            <li> my teeth feel very clean when i am done brushing with this perio brush, i only wish there was an automatic version.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other kind of  toothbrush.</li>
            <li> lies flat on counter top.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell though how well they clean.</li>
            <li> These clean so well and are soft like I hoped for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dr. Collins Perio brush is SO soft, doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums, and yet my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Yes, soft toothbrushes will get your teeth clean IF you purchase this brand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush that really cleans and gets the job done without being too harsh on my gums.</li>
            <li> Good quality toothbrush, but not as soft as I expected.</li>
            <li> but I never achieved a super glossy clean with regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I am an adult and wearing my braces and these are pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Super soft, but do the cleaning trick!</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d kept better track of how long I used each one</li>
            <li> My gums are not as sore and their color looks better; more of a pink hue than red.</li>
            <li> Also, the narrow handle makes it very comfortable to hold!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ll run towards them, anxious to be grazed by this angelic brush of good fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever left my mouth feeling as clean, or as fresh-- and the feeling lasts all day.</li>
            <li> These simple, soft toothbrushes leave my teeth feeling clean and smooth every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found super soft in stores.  </li>
            <li> Was told by my dentist to get a super soft brush to prevent damage to my gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had super sensitive bleeding gums since I was like 18-19 (26 now) and could never keep it under control.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is SUPER soft just like advertised..</li>
            <li> I was looking for a super soft bristle toothbrush and the Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrushes were just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Super soft</li>
            <li> I have always been very particular about my toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much as good as it gets, at least from what it looks like now.</li>
            <li> This is so gentle yet strong enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> They are a sturdier material (Nylon) that last longer too, so are more economical at the slightly higher initial cost.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to actually brush my teeth without being super worried and careful.  </li>
            <li> but it turns yellow quickly!</li>
            <li> I will always Only buy Dr. Collins and with Amazon they were shipped so quickly too!  </li>
            <li> I really believe she can brush with a cactus if it had enough bristles and be fine.</li>
            <li> it feels good now, instead of dreading it and trying hard not to irritate my gums.</li>
            <li> Even though they are so soft, they still last quite a long time and get everything nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My son also uses it, he has braces and gum line recession, so, he uses those brushes and it works very well for him also.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend this brand.  </li>
            <li> These really help.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They hold up really well</li>
            <li> , I went on amazon in search of a real one.</li>
            <li> very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No toothbrush ever really seemed &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; to me.</li>
            <li> Give it a try - just remember to brush gently and let the bristles do the work.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works very well for me.</li>
            <li> The tapered bristles really get in there.</li>
            <li> teeth much easier</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The Dr. Collins brush leaves your teeth much cleaner for longer and gently massages your gums.</li>
            <li> and it is working very well</li>
            <li> The bristles get between your teeth very well too.  </li>
            <li> the heck could a toothbrush incite so much excitement in consumers?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Such a fantastic purchase.  </li>
            <li> but you might as well go buy a store brand at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like they cleaned my teeth very well</li>
            <li> I really like the way this toothbrush feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m remineralizing my teeth and this has helped by being so gentle.</li>
            <li> If they wear well they are highly recommended!</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s my problem for not making sure the zipper is all the way closed.</li>
            <li> The designer should be fired because I really almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of how it looks.  </li>
            <li> very well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not at all gentle on the gums and</li>
            <li> These toothbrush are very flexible and would reach all places in your mouth.</li>
            <li> really DO get every part of your tooth.</li>
            <li> This is getting my teeth sooooo much cleaner, like coming out of the dentist chair everyday!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is much gentler.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to apply too much pressure when I brush, even though I try to remember not to do that.</li>
            <li> I think the price is reasonable, for a 3pack.</li>
            <li> Very nice...best toothbrush ever.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The Dr. Collins perio works really well</li>
            <li> Besides all that, the package arrived very well done and the delivery was within the combined.</li>
            <li> I sincerely don&#x27;t think that anyone who tries it would ever want to use another brush.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m still feeling that bit of sensitivity after a really in depth flossing.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Dr. Collins.</li>
            <li> thanks, I will be using it very soon.</li>
            <li> and you start noticing  how much their hurting your gums.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li> I really like the density of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> I have very fussy gums with a propensity for sensitivity and infections.  </li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrushes, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> it so much bought it for the whole family.</li>
            <li> but most importantly it&#x27;s not extra soft</li>
            <li> These are my favorite extra soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find such a soft brush as this in stores.</li>
            <li> these bristles are baby soft and my mouth is thanking me!!!</li>
            <li> I do seem to like it very much, the bristles are very soft on the gums.</li>
            <li> I love how soft they are, yet they still clean your teeth really well without destroying your gums.  </li>
            <li> I just used my newly arrived brush for the first time.</li>
            <li> It is soft, it is just the right size and the bristles</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and make it easy to not only brush your teeth, but your gums too.</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes in the mail a second ago and was a bit excited to test it out.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, I don&#x27;t feel that sore/ sensitive sensation as I usually feel with the 360.</li>
            <li> I like it better than any other toothbrush, and have sent one of them to my ex-husband to try.</li>
            <li> Immediately ordered more along with the vanilla mint toothpaste (that does not make me gag like other mints).  </li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t look like a race car, it doesn&#x27;t have multicolored bristles, but it cleans your teeth better than any other brush I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried ABC, ORAL B, COLGATE and many other brands</li>
            <li> Seems much better than the other toothbrushes I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> The bottoms get gunked with toothpaste more so than other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;m still going strong on my first Perio toothbush and it&#x27;s been four whole months since I began using it, and not a single splayed bristle in sight.</li>
            <li> Very soft, yet efficient and effective at cleaning and getting into tight spots.  </li>
            <li> so I have to clean it out occasionally and</li>
            <li> You actually feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I started recently having some problems, my teeth becoming sensitive.</li>
            <li> My teeth actually feel clean after using it and my gums don&#x27;t feel assaulted.</li>
            <li> I recently got braces and needed a toothbrush that would help clean and wouldn&#x27;t lossed the braces.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft, I love this toothbrush and I will continue to use it for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if I could have chosen the colors of the brushes that arrived, but that is only a minor annoyance.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and most toothbrushes I buy just aren&#x27;t soft enough even if they say so on the package.</li>
            <li> only thing I like is the needle/like edges of the bristles, witch is good for cleaning gum&#x27;s, for no longer than 30 sec, apparently ;))).</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s great and any other &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brushes feel super hard.</li>
            <li> I recently had gum surgery and got a special &amp;#34;ultra soft&amp;#34; toothbrush from the periodontist.</li>
            <li> that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, these actually last a good 2 to 3 months, not the typical 30 days.</li>
            <li> They are soft and yet they do get my teeth very clean, that is as long as the bristles are not worn....</li>
            <li> so much softer than normal brushes.  </li>
            <li> You can feel the difference the first time, so soft for how well the brush works/scrubs.</li>
            <li> an\d a nice small head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the first time I used these it felt soo soft</li>
            <li> and it was quite soft and noted that the bristles did have a needle-like shape that would be helpful in getting between tight teeth (like my own) and below the gum line.</li>
            <li> Easy on the gums, cleans the teeth well and lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> This brush feels so much better than my previous toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you really need a soft brush that lasts a reasonable period of time, this is the one.</li>
            <li> There are smaller version of similar to these, they are ok.</li>
            <li> Fortunately my gums have healed and I probably don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;ultra soft&amp;#34; anymore, but this may well not be soft enough for you if you are immediately post-op or have ongoing gum issues.</li>
            <li> The main advantage of this toothbrush is that the brushes are made of</li>
            <li> To get a halfway decent floss job done, I&#x27;m in front of the mirror for 10 minutes after they&#x27;ve gone to bed going through all the things I could</li>
            <li> so I still have many of them left over a year later.</li>
            <li> There only a few times in your life where you come across something so good</li>
            <li> I can say there are no over the counter brushes that are as soft, with as thin bristles and do a great job at cleaning teeth like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> these are very soft and gentle, yet get the job done.</li>
            <li> I find the Perio toothbrush very soft &amp; gentle on the gum.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and work very well for her.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles, much softer than oral-b.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and gums was was looking for a toothbrush that is gentle to use.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think a special toothbrush was going to make that big of a difference on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The bristles are VERY SOFT and don&#x27;t irritate used it after i came from the dentist.!</li>
            <li> I am starting to see some gumline recession due to my overzealous use of that sonicare darling (seriously, do not use it more than once a day and very gently at that.)  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I buy them in a pack of three and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend giving this toothbrush a try if you are experiencing bleeding or receding gums.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m hooked, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll ever use, highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> would recommend these to everyone, despite their high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe if they&#x27;ve done a major cleaning at the dentist and a professional hygienist has hovered over you with his/her assortment of sharp metal picks, hooks, and scraper, but you can&#x27;t do this kind of floss job with a strand at home.</li>
            <li> WOW this is the toothbrush I have been looking for!!</li>
            <li> I am glad I decided to try out a brand name I am not familiar with.</li>
            <li> However, I might be able to go a little bit longer with these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to explain if you haven&#x27;t used the brush.  </li>
            <li> But those are perfect, and the price isn&#x27;t bad also.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does a great job brushing my teeth and its not to expensive</li>
            <li> It is soft but cleans really well.  </li>
            <li> It is really soft, yet cleans very well.</li>
            <li> It is soft and gentle on your teeth, but I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the handle.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who wants a soft toothbrush for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> so I really needed &#x27;truly&#x27; soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is soft but cleans very well.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> You can feels the bristles really getting in between your teeth because they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li> Works really well, does the job of cleaning without hurting the soft tissues.</li>
            <li> It for sensitive teeth and it brushes gently.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and gentle on my gums yet</li>
            <li> Oh goodness, they really are soft.  </li>
            <li> but I can no longer use it daily so, in full blown panic mode, I&#x27;ve been searching for a really soft toothbrush, trying drugstore brand after drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li> The narrow bristle tips do seem to get between teeth better than others.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bunch of different soft tip toothbrushes just to try different brands, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use mouthwash or any kind of spinning toothbrush anymore, because that also made my teeth extremely sensitive in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought a few and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> , i normally switch it out every 2 months or so...</li>
            <li> I was of the opinion that pretty much all brand name toothbrushes were the same.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t scrub away everything like a normal toothbrush would.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad toothbrush by any means, but it&#x27;s really not a soft brush.</li>
            <li> Tapered bristles make a huge difference, and I noticed the brush doesn&#x27;t get super hard after a few weeks like most brushes.  </li>
            <li> Other than that its perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> But went back to normal right after.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Although there was a tendency towards fewer sites with gingival abrasion with the a tapered toothbrush, it was less effective than the a regular toothbrush in the removal of plaque biofilm and reduction of bleeding.\\</li>
            <li> So I started looking for soft brushes and I bought different toothbrushes for toddlers that are describes as \\&quot;super soft\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I mean my mouth feels amazing after using this brush.</li>
            <li> I guess many people haven&#x27;t used any other soft toothbrushes for comparison, but this toothbrush is not that soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also makes me see how all these other toothpastes are really marketed with their bell and whistles just to suck more money out of consumers when ALL we need is a standard brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my only brush in the house right now.  </li>
            <li> I found it very abrasive to my gums and the bristles are so long that I can&#x27;t fit the toothbrush into the space to reach the back teeth.  </li>
            <li> They live up to their claim.</li>
            <li> I have it for 4 months and it looks brand new.</li>
            <li> Been using it for months, and still looks new.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new tooth brush and came across this one in my search.</li>
            <li> This is my new toothbrush for life.</li>
            <li> new--</li>
            <li> Like it because of narrow head and soft bristles - just ok toothbrush</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered, I&#x27;ve got 3 hot pink toothbrushs</li>
            <li> You have to change them every three months or so, but I now wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, particularly the name brands found in grocery and drug stores, which are complete garbage.</li>
            <li> This product is really solid, much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I had been using a soft bristled toothbrush for years and never found one that really felt soft.  </li>
            <li> When brushing not only did I not feel irritation in the slightest, but I really felt the cleaning power, they really get in there and do work.</li>
            <li> , really soft and decently priced&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> then it was time for something new as my gum lines were getting very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> and they are very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush.  </li>
            <li> BUT this toothbrush is waaay easier on my gums and teeth, as i have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles that don&#x27;t hurt your gums.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are VERY soft, softer than any tooth brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These are very soft.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a very soft toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My gums are very sensitive and I needed a toothbrush that would not leave me with irritated gums.</li>
            <li> very soft.</li>
            <li> This plain looking toothbrush actually feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a search for a super soft toothbrush for a long time as I tend to brush away my enamel with the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; brushes that I&#x27;ve used throughout the years.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Actually makes brushing your teeth enjoyable, and I noticed my teeth felt cleaner than after using other toobrushes.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> I searched to get a soft toothbrush and bam!</li>
            <li> I have this toothbrush to thank for it because I haven&#x27;t made any other significant changes.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to the only one color, these were evidently custom printed for a Dr. Suzman (phone number also imprinted on the handle).</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are so soft!  </li>
            <li> On this brush density pretty regular for the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; type of toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> After opening the packaging for the first time, I thought it looked kind of weird.</li>
            <li> I want very soft one, but not too soft that it won&#x27;t do its job.</li>
            <li> Since it wasn&#x27;t a name brand apparently no one was interested.  </li>
            <li> , they felt kind of weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soft brushes before and always end up going back to a harder brush just because the soft ones never feel like they clean very well.</li>
            <li> Never thought I could be in love or have strong feeling about any toothbrush, but I really am crazy about these.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and initially it does not feel like it is doing much.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that I can get around my back teeth easily because of the smaller hear and bristles that seem to reach further in.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes because they&#x27;re super soft, which is what I need and can be difficult to find.</li>
            <li> And the bristles are so soft that it actually feels good to brush your teeth; all those store toothbrushes that say &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; on them still always felt very hard to me.</li>
            <li> I have no dental troubles at all except for using too hard brushes for most my adult life hitch</li>
            <li> More effective at removing stains than even the hard bristle premium brushes (which are impossible to find now), and these are super soft!</li>
            <li> It cleans really well for having such soft bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush also lasts much longer than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Anyone that needs a soft toothbrush will appreciate this one...</li>
            <li> B00206DXQ0 Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Toothpaste (4.4 oz]]</li>
            <li> when I used this my teeth feel sensitive, but I have never had sensitivity on my teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are highly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about time somebody improved on the old fashioned toothbrush, and with this one, they did.</li>
            <li> Thanks to ppl who came up with such brushes.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to use soft bristles yrs ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have an electric professional oral b brush, and I truly doubt I will ever use it again.  </li>
            <li> Soft on the gums, but cleans my teeth perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has extremely soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> Like flossing while you brush because the tiny bristles really get in there between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Just as described; this toothbrush is soft so it doesn&#x27;t harm the gums.  </li>
            <li> I realize now they were never that soft to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how soft it is.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the (standard) shipping was notably fast, faster than packages I ordered before it.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think that bristles this soft would get the job done well</li>
            <li> I would reccommend using this toothbrush for anyone with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I think that 1) comes with the territory for a soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and receding gums, my dentist&#x27;s office suggested I lay off the Sonicare..</li>
            <li> They are truly soft and remain soft for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and these bristles did not hurt my gums or teeth.  </li>
            <li> SO SOFT -</li>
            <li> My gums were receding and my teeth were getting sensitive</li>
            <li> Extra soft bristles gently cleans without abrasion for sensitive root surfaces.</li>
            <li> anyway.. if you don&#x27;t mind a manual toothbrush, and have needs for a soft head, this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> In addition, the design of the head and bristles do make the difference; I feel that the bristles get in between my teeth and eject food particles that my old 360 did not do well, and I can reach and brush my wisdom</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> My dentist used to provide the sensitive style that you could not find over the counter</li>
            <li> If you have sore gums, have had oral surgery or have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I keep it sanitized with a Dr. Tung&#x27;s natural toothbrush cap.</li>
            <li> So soft, and almost no bleeding when i brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended i get a soft bristle brush and brush horizontally than vertically.</li>
            <li> Soft, durable - no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Soft tooth brush</li>
            <li> and I will have them for a long time ;)</li>
            <li> I can tell that it is getting around every tooth because it is soft.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a child&#x27;s soft would work as well, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> But not so soft that they are ineffective.  </li>
            <li> It is really soft</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gems and teeth</li>
            <li> The problem is that the head is very big and the bristles very dense.</li>
            <li> My gums are sensitive, so I&#x27;d been looking for a soft brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt they were too soft, but my dentist convinced me to stay with them to protect tooth enamel</li>
            <li> Soft bristles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week now and brushing now hurts every time, and my whole mouth is actually aching as I write this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have sensitive teeth but haven&#x27;t had any problems with bleeding gums or sensitivity there before.</li>
            <li> soft.</li>
            <li> This Dr Collins Perio toothbrush is identical to the extremely soft toothbrushes my dentist always gives me.  </li>
            <li> The Dr. Collins Perio toothbrushes ARE soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is what soft bristles should feel like.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth or receeding gum line, this is the tooth brush for you.</li>
            <li> soft</li>
            <li> I need soft bristles that don&#x27;t scratch my gums and make them bleed.  </li>
            <li> Dentist recommended a soft brush but didn&#x27;t specify a brand, so I chose this one.</li>
            <li> Soft feel and</li>
            <li> He loves how soft they are.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth &amp; used to get OralB</li>
            <li> Even when they are labeled Soft (they are not).&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> The so-called soft bristles were still scratchy on my teeth and didn&#x27;t help with my receding gums.  </li>
            <li> , they are incredibly soft and I don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive mouth with them.</li>
            <li> I always look for soft toothbrush because I have to, or my gums would bleed.</li>
            <li> She was surprised to learn that it was because of the toothbrush I was using.</li>
            <li> These brushes are quite soft and goes between the teeth.</li>
            <li> sensitive gums makes be a Dr. Collins Perio brush convert.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and tender...</li>
            <li> I found these as an alternative to the sonicare which totally fixed me about 15 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare now makes a soft brush</li>
            <li> I use a Walgreens brand soft toothbrush now</li>
            <li> But I finally was given a softer bristled toothbrush by my dental hygeniest called Plak Smacker Ultra Gentle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll grab an old fashioned tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this inexpensive pack of 3 soft toothbrushes based on reviews.  </li>
            <li> The bristles themselves are so soft, it&#x27;s like velvet rubbing on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother the areas of my teeth where the dentin is showing.  </li>
            <li> This one is so soft.  </li>
            <li> Soft but the bristle arrangement works well for cleaning, even between teeth and at the gum line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo soft and the tapered bristles tickle.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is soft as advertised while still brushing the teeth well.</li>
            <li> my 3-pack came filled with all green ones.</li>
            <li> I needed a soft toothbrush with just bristles no plastic thingy&#x27;s or anything on them...</li>
            <li> A truely soft bristled brush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence and need a soft brush, try it.</li>
            <li> It is much, much softer than the \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I never knew that brushing my teeth could be painless, which isn&#x27;t something an adult should have to say.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m undergoing head and neck radiotherapy and was looking for a soft toothbrush that wouldn&#x27;t irriate my sore gums caused by the treatment.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use soft toothbrushes in my house because I never thought they would work well.</li>
            <li> There are a ton of soft bristles on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I used these for a few months and when I went back to the dentist, my numbers were mostly 1 and 2s vs 3s.</li>
            <li> Since it seems there is only one model of extra soft toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever been able to find in stores, one that&#x27;s really not all that soft anyhow</li>
            <li> I started using Dr. Collins toothbrushes a few years back and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are amazingly soft and comfortable yet manage to sweep away debris that my stiff electric can miss.  </li>
            <li> But... i found the sonicare and back then they guaranteed right on the box, to cure gingivitis and peridontal issues or your money back.  </li>
            <li> it is a bit stiff with no curves to make holding it comfortable.  </li>
            <li> My dentist has to special order extra soft toothbrushes and recommends only extra soft brushes.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to push hard, just gentle circular motions gets everything clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the nimbus which is also available on Amazon, but they poked my gums and caused my entire jaw to ache due to the gum pain.</li>
            <li> To me it seems much softer than other brushes I have tried and much easier on the gums, I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I felt like the bristles were really getting my teeth clean with the least amount of wear and tear.  </li>
            <li> This tooth brush was very soft and easy on my delicate gums.</li>
            <li> I usually buy extra soft toothbrushes, but this one is way better.</li>
            <li> So I have searched high and low for a soft bristled toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I prefer soft tooth brushes and these toothbrushes are highly recommended by several forums.</li>
            <li> I have bought extra soft toothbrushes from oral b at the store but these bristles are softer; however due to their compactness, my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t still have the box, but I think the one that arrived may have said medium or hard on the top, whereas the one pictured only says soft.  </li>
            <li> They are soft enough not to irritate my mouth, which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> apparently its not going to be as soft as &amp;#34;GUM&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Only problem is that it needed to be replaced after about a month of usage instead of two to three months for a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> they are soft, small bristles so they can sneak in between your teeth and clean out the food and what not.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old prefers these over any other tooth brush because they are so incredibly gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> My husband felt the same when he used his new brush.  </li>
            <li> I enthusiastically gave one of my three new brushes to my partner, who said the same thing.    </li>
            <li> My only concern is that it looks like the \\&quot;filaments\\&quot; might eventually get loose as they look a bit flimsy and sometimes crooked, but apparently they are supposed to last longer than standard nylon bristles that most brushes have.  </li>
            <li> I have been giving these toothbrushes out to my family and the only complaint is that now that their teeth feel so clean they really notice when they need to brush again.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started brushing, I said \\&quot;aaahhhhh\\&quot; - I have sensitive teeth/gums, and I have had no luck finding extra soft toothbrushes in the store.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft, but they last much longer than regular extra soft brushes, which seem to splay out after a couple brushes.</li>
            <li> But no where near the pain or discomfort of a professional cleaning or traditional flossing.</li>
            <li> My gums are slowly turning a healthy pinkish again instead of red and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These have very soft bristles, in fact even softer than the children&#x27;s version of this same brand.  </li>
            <li> very soft ,especially after they tighten or changed ,this is recommended</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect if you want a soft brush but are unhappy with the job that ordinary toothbrushes do.</li>
            <li> It still cleans like no other</li>
            <li> FINALLY a toothbrush that actually IS soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first use my gums did feel a bit sore, like some other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> Super-soft bristles like no other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My dentist said i need to use a extra soft toothbrush!</li>
            <li> These brushes have very soft and gentle bristles and will not clean adult teeth well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very soft for the first few weeks, after that it starts to harden up a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My tongue keeps rubbing my teeth because they feel so slick and clean.  </li>
            <li> But after a few days I became accustomed and realized that regular soft are super</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to extra soft toothbrushes from my dentist due to receeding gums.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extra-soft but yet firm enough to thoroughly clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy Oral B , but even the extra soft oral B brushes do not compare to these in terms of softness.</li>
            <li> I will now only use this brand and the Colgate 360 Sensitive Pro.</li>
            <li> He indicated that it was crucial for me to use an ultra soft toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have lost some teeth and needed something really soft on the gums for daily use.</li>
            <li> Of course you still have to floss and use mouthwash, but WOW this makes such a difference!</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to get a extra soft toothbrush, this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I am sticking to my Colgate Extra Soft brushes.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, but just angled enough to get between the gumline and tooth.  </li>
            <li> I got the set of three thinking that if is soft it wont last...</li>
            <li> I was using a soft brush prior to finding these</li>
            <li> Brushing with my former toothbrush brand was uncomfortable, and if I tried to brush more gently, my teeth didn&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li> I only bought this brush because I was buying a sensitive toothpaste, and stumbled upon it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I promise you if you try this toothbrush you will never go back to your old toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Over the years using only soft brushes I have undermined my dental roots.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are extra soft and seem durable.</li>
            <li> If you use an extra soft brush you must try this one.  </li>
            <li> I am confused as to how this product received so many 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how good this brush is.</li>
            <li> My dentist always yells at me for brushing too hard and always gives me a super soft toothbrush at the end of my visits.  </li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for: a slight crook in the handle, a tapered head, and very soft bristles in a flat arrangement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally sold on this new product I just recently learned about.</li>
            <li> Before, I&#x27;d tend to \\&quot;forget\\&quot; to brush my teeth (really, avoiding brushing) because it didn&#x27;t seem to do much or last very long.</li>
            <li> However, being able to fine an extra soft that was not a child&#x27;s toothbrush was annoying.</li>
            <li> head is smaller than what is standard on regular grocery store brushes but after getting used to it, I find that the small size is much better for getting back into those rear molars and inside surfaces.</li>
            <li> Hard to get excited about toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I need to brush 4-5 times a day due to my Invisalign and my mouth was taking a beating from that much exposure to my electric brush.  </li>
            <li> Where other toothbrushes have been rough on my gums, these toothbrushes have improved the health of my gums, even in a spot where there was mild receding occurring.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gums or gum recession from excessively hard brushing, this toothbrush is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> You really start realizing how bad these popular toothbrushes are when you have something like braces(which</li>
            <li> Polyester bristles are a major improvement over standard nylon brushes.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy a different style of toothbrush every time, then I got a prototype of one of these a few years ago as a free gift for buying a rather expensive mild-flavor sensitivity toothpaste &amp; now I won&#x27;t use any other kind of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> yet firm enough to feel right.  </li>
            <li> (and bigger, those are kind of small, they designed for a small mouth)</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice daily and it leaves my mouth feeling tingly and clean.  </li>
            <li> Super hard tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> They are a tad pricy, but the bristles don&#x27;t wear out or fall out as fast as they do in a typical toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Soft and last long.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not going to pretend I&#x27;m one of those ultra conscientious and fastidious dental hygienists that brushes and flosses completely 3 times a day, but I do brush every single day.</li>
            <li> You can really see up close the tiny filaments at the ends, and some of them curl slightly at the tips.  </li>
            <li> I normally have an unfortunate layer of biofilm on the top of my teeth next to the gum line that even flossing couldn&#x27;t tackle, but this brush makes it easier for me to scrub harder without damaging or wearing away my gums at the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles but very long lasting, Most people brush too hard with brushes that are too stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite effective, &amp; I believe that being overzealous in the past with Crest Spinbrushes and similar products that have hard bristles caused my teeth to become sensitive over time, so be careful.</li>
            <li> challenge I have with this particular order is that they didn&#x27;t say that with the description of \\&quot;colors vary\\&quot; that it meant I would get all 3 the same color - dark</li>
            <li> and I start thinking of replacing them only after the longer filaments start getting bent a little, so it depends on how much and how vigorously I use them.</li>
            <li> Needed a very soft brush for ulcerated mouth due to chemo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, gentle, delicate and yet knows how to do a proper cleaning because it does not hurt the gums.</li>
            <li> I since switched back to a normal brush and my gums have come down a bit but still not fully repaired.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothbrush with soft bristles but they seemed stiff and were not as soft as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I had seen these in amazon before but thought hey how much difference can a toothbrush make aren&#x27;t they all the same but after using it I&#x27;m realizing this toothbrush can save thousands because half the reason our enamels are wearing off is because of the sandpaper-on-a-stick were all buying, even IF you buy the super soft expensive stuff like I have.</li>
            <li> The enamel on my teeth is very thin, and this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t scrub off more enamel.</li>
            <li> Is the softer of all the toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried, without the chintzy give that other soft toothbrushes have, hence their &#x27;patented tapered ends&#x27;</li>
            <li> Softer than other soft tooth brushes that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is surely soft, but the bristles are too sharp for my tender gums.  </li>
            <li> The commercial &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes at my local drugstore were not soft enough.  </li>
            <li> Turns out, it&#x27;s not nearly as soft as the one I got from the office, and it seems roughly the same as my old &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> Other brands sold in stores are soft the first or second time, but then they become hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no durability issues, as they seem to last as long as a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more expensive per brush and the bristles are also not nearly as soft.</li>
            <li> The FIRST USE, it had gotten rid of this hard layer on one of my wisdom</li>
            <li> One reviewer mentioned it was a bit too hard at first.</li>
            <li> I used the colgate extra soft 360, but after they went up in price, and noticing that they lose they softness in less that 2 months, I looked into switching tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> They really do last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Last quite long</li>
            <li> I found myself brushing harder than normal because I didn&#x27;t feel the abrasion I was used to with my other brushes.</li>
            <li> Had perio issues with 3-7mm pockets all down to 3s now after using this and a natural mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It is soft, but a little big for my mouth.</li>
            <li> last very long.</li>
            <li> The tapered polyester bristles last a very long time and have saved my gums from wear and tear.</li>
            <li> It reaches nicely between the teeth, especially with the bottom front teeth, where plaque accumulates badly for me.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft yet firm enough to do the job on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I ran across this toothbrush under a different name on the discount shelf at our local military commissary.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, though, the angle makes it easy to press a little too hard while brushing.</li>
            <li> but other reviewers did :O)</li>
            <li> Very soft but not sure if it actually cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> the material last very long!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a big deal, especially since my name begins with Suz, and it feels a little odd to order something new and discover they are from a companies custom order.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, which takes a little getting used to, but you can feel them hugging the gum line while you brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, I feel anger thinking of how many years I have abused my teeth with the trash these major companies are putting out to brush teeth with.</li>
            <li> I started to get receding gums from brushing to hard and to much.</li>
            <li> The dentist keeps complaining that I brush much too hard...</li>
            <li> was I thinking when I thought a hard bristle or even one of the supposedly \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes were really helping me keep my teeth and gums healthy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had braces earlier in life and brushed too hard on the gumline causing receding gums and sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> The wear indicators let me know when the brush needs replacement and at an average use of 2x daily they last around 4 months (2 minute brush time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to write a review to help anyone who is thinking about buying them, but is not sure if the bristles are soft enough.  </li>
            <li> annd notice an overall difference in my oral health but not much has changed.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was a really strange looking toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> brush IS NOT soft.  </li>
            <li> and i plan to keep using these as long as i remember to order em.</li>
            <li> Yet it cleans well and lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li> My gums/teeth are not as &#x27;sensitive&#x27; now that I have been using this brush for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> it keeps form for a long time.</li>
            <li> I tend to have a heavy hand while brushing so soft bristles are a must.</li>
            <li> toothbrushes for infants were not soft enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also stays soft over time and does not harden after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> It might be too soft for those with a heavy hand and might prefer stiffer bristles, but not me.</li>
            <li> Long handle helps as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long but not too thick, I can tell much thought was put into</li>
            <li> /&gt;It occurred to me that maybe I was brushing too hard the first time, though I brushed as I normally would with any drugstore toothbrush (which I had been using previously, something Oral-B soft bristled), and have since decreased the pressure to almost nothing, but it still just _hurts_.</li>
            <li> My gums were receding hard and the only new thing in my dental regime was this brush.  </li>
            <li> The design is tapered at the ends into tiny polyester filaments so it gets deeper down into the gums and tiny spaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although more expensive than other competitors, this has THEE softest bristles I&#x27;ve ever tried...bar none!  </li>
            <li> If you want a plain old toothbrush, you could buy this one</li>
            <li> They are extra long compared to my other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It has extra long bristles that massage your gums and make your teeth feel cleaner than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes feel different than any other toothbrush I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had enough with all the fancy stuff other companies have come out with.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using these brushes for several years now and wouldn&#x27;t want to use any other brand.</li>
            <li> The bristles are made differently than other toothbrushes I have used</li>
            <li> It looks so basic but outperforms all the other toothbrushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other micro britsle toothbrushes as well - but these last longer.</li>
            <li> NEVER, EVER, EVER going back to those other toothbrushes (Colgate, Crest, etc etc).</li>
            <li> I also use a Sonicare, but now only once a day; for the 2-3 other brushings, I grab the Dr. Perio.</li>
            <li> These soft, white nylon bristle toothbrushes are hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is that I did not switch to these brushes years ago - before I developed problems resulting from too hard brushes.</li>
            <li> I have to use extra soft toothbrushes because I brush too hard.  </li>
            <li> After using, you should dry the bristles though, just take some tissue paper and squeeze the bristles; otherwise, you might start to see a brownish color on the bottom of the handle where the bristles go into the handle.</li>
            <li> so they have the chance to dry well between uses.</li>
            <li> That only lasted a few weeks, and my mouth was back to bleeding again.</li>
            <li> every single one of your teeth flossed 360?</li>
            <li> The brush heads are soft and small.  </li>
            <li> I did not realize that bleeding gumlines was not normal.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good toothbrush - makes me wonder why I was using other crap on the market.</li>
            <li> so I figured I had nothing to loose and ordered one.</li>
            <li> teeth are actually getting cleaner between the teeth, my gums are getting healthier, AND I am not having the continual irritations to my gums caused by ALL the other toothbrushes I have used for the last few decades...</li>
            <li> once you use these you wont want to go back to the typical mainstream toothbrushes thats a guarantee</li>
            <li> I also brush very softly and be careful not to brush too hard.  </li>
            <li> It is odd that extra soft brushes are so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I hardly feel like its brushing its so soft.</li>
            <li> You can brush as hard as you want and it will still be soft in the mouth, if you&#x27;re worried about gum soreness or recession.  </li>
            <li> Soft toothbrushes in the store were still way too hard.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a soft brush that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> To me this toothbrush was too hard, maybe my gums are too sensitive ,but I had too find a softer one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the GUM brand brush but having trouble finding it recently.</li>
            <li> I do not worry about being too rough on the gums.</li>
            <li> Is it my imagination or have \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes gotten harder and harder?</li>
            <li> I can see and feel the difference in only a few weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dr Collins you got a lifelong customer</li>
            <li> I had a green, pink and blue brush in my set.</li>
            <li> Added with Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Toothpaste, there is no better relief!</li>
            <li> So, can&#x27;t go wrong, right?  </li>
            <li> little expensive, but they do last quite a bit longer than normal brushes, so i think they come out to close to the same.  </li>
            <li> The handle is functional, mostly flat rather than round, and has textured pads to help avoid slipping.</li>
            <li> I have three different electric toothbrushes (costing hundreds of dollars), but after some recent trauma to a molar, I had some serious sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid that this brush won&#x27;t clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> We used to buy a Japanese brand of toothbrush when we were living overseas and were very disappointed to not be able to find something similar in stores here in the US.  </li>
            <li> it felt like a was brushing with velvet or some other pleasurable substance.  </li>
            <li> That being said, they also leave my teeth feeling cleaner that other toothbrushes, even electric.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical when I read all the glowing reviews on the Perio</li>
            <li> Other toothbrushes feel like scrub brushes compared to this one.</li>
            <li> teeth that I just couldn&#x27;t get off with my other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Feels weird at first</li>
            <li> I am an agressive brusher and wear out any other toothbrush in about 1 month, bending the bristles over.  </li>
            <li> Gets teeth their cleanest, and teeth feel smoother after brushing than with any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> He threw out all of his other brushes as soon as he put this brush on his teeth after just having said, \\&quot;lets hold onto our other brushes in case we don&#x27;t like these.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I used to often bleed or hurt my gums with other brushes until trying these.</li>
            <li> My mother, on the other hand, does not like them due to liking medium/hard toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Those are a pain to find in the stores, and I usually don&#x27;t have an extra half-hour to search among the hundreds of toothbrushes hanging there.  </li>
            <li> Only the tips (about 2 mm) are extra thin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth with the receding gums that come with age, which makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> you want to run down the street and tel everyone about it whether it&#x27;s big or small</li>
            <li> There is less pressure on my gums using the same stroke force when comparing to my other past toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;26 years of using crap toothpaste with fluoride and other junk, using ridiculous hyped up marketing super colorful toothbrushes, and that harsh mouthwash that makes you wanna</li>
            <li> At the same time extra soft toothbrushes have become nearly impossible to find.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how hard they are to find in the standard pharmacies and supermarkets, so I decided to look on Amazon and found these Dr. Collins Perio brushes.  </li>
            <li> I always brushed too hard, (habit I guess)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that a couple of bristles have come off under my gum line.</li>
            <li> They all got much harder with a few weeks&#x27; use and, mind you,</li>
            <li> /&gt;2)Somewhat pricey (although they brought down the price).</li>
            <li> I am now extremely outraged and offended by all those cheaply made (yet more expensive than the Perio!)</li>
            <li> Looks like it&#x27;s going to be extremely durable and long-lasting, too!</li>
            <li> All other toothbrushes should be outlawed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an invisalign patient and have previously gone through perio treatments.  </li>
            <li> As for someone in a previous review commenting about the name on the toothbrush making them feel like it&#x27;s a dentist advertisement.</li>
            <li> I bleed less.</li>
            <li> I feel like this truly cleans my pockets and leaves for less flossing.</li>
            <li> I would have less gum recession.  </li>
            <li> my dentist was giving me was beating my gums half to death.  </li>
            <li> The only dental problems I have had in life are the odd cavity, but I&#x27;ve never liked brushing with stiff bristled brushes.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding these in the USA, but this brand and also one other (see my other reviews) are what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> And, the abrasive nature of all other toothbrushes leaves my gums a little raw.  </li>
            <li> but it is just weird to order something you expect to be a new product-</li>
            <li> was a little put off that the toothbrushes came with a dentist&#x27;s name and phone number on them.</li>
            <li> I wish the handle were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little cheaper though</li>
            <li> No one should use any other toothbrush!!  </li>
            <li> I want people to know what they are missing.  </li>
            <li> All the store brushes labeled \\&quot;soft\\&quot; have been too harsh for me..</li>
            <li> I saw this one on Amazon and read the reviews--and now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months I agree.</li>
            <li> Tired of the costco packs of regular toothbrushes I turned to amazon reviews for some guidance.</li>
            <li> The handle broke few days after we bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that even though a toothbrush is labeled &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; it&#x27;s still firm in my opinion , so I had to resort to buying kids</li>
            <li> The individual bristles are quite thin, and there are about a million of them.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a bit too harsh on your gums.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get brittle and hard like a few other brushes do.</li>
            <li> I now spend less time in the dental chair for cleanings as a result - and i like that!</li>
            <li> This is the softest toothbrush I could find (even the other toothbrushes that say \\&quot;soft\\&quot; on the package were too hard).  </li>
            <li> Even the softest toothbrushes in the stores are ridiculously stiff compared to the ones my dentist gives me and they always cause my gums to bleed.  </li>
            <li> store bought toothbrushes are so Stiff.  </li>
            <li> I was doing serious damage to my teeth (and my mouth) using these so roughly and so often.  </li>
            <li> These are clearly very bare and simplistic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> However, these are cheaper and stand in for a person who&#x27;s on a tight budget!</li>
            <li> and these at least soften the blow a little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not okay with that.</li>
            <li> It was kinda weird to have all the same colored brush with my mom.</li>
            <li> which is a comment I didn&#x27;t usually get before.  </li>
            <li> This booth brush, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t last longer than ordinary toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more pain whatsoever when brushing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one did not stop the gums from receding Further.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive compared to fancy electric ones, and works just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> The larger head is difficult to maneuver without gagging.</li>
            <li> I usually have to change my toothbrush every 30 days per my dentist recommendation.</li>
            <li> There are these weird long bristles around the edge that feel like scratchy whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I could only find pink and purple :(</li>
            <li> I was not happy with my previous toothbrush</li>
            <li> Because the bristles are as hard as needles.  </li>
            <li> Since I discovered Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrushes I can scrub hard and as often as I please.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time with receding gums.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to brush too hard.</li>
            <li> Keep medium and hard brushes for cleaning grout.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find, which is why I gave this a shot.  </li>
            <li> But you&#x27;re not supposed to brush hard as it will hurt your teethes enamel.  </li>
            <li> This brush minimizes damage should you brush too hard.</li>
            <li> I brush too hard.</li>
            <li> but I moved away &amp; they are hard to find in stores or online.</li>
            <li> However, if you brush your teeth with like hard stuffs still stuck on your teeth</li>
            <li> After using this brush, I think my oral B was too hard</li>
            <li> My dentist have told me I brush to hard.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t reach no matter how hard I try.</li>
            <li> If you are one of those who find the so-called extra-soft toothbrushes too hard, you should try this one.</li>
            <li> grind my teeth and have always had a tendency to brush too hard and have gotten toothbrush erosion as a result , but with the perio I feel like I am being kinder to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush helps overcome that bad habit of mine, because the bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li> I had some dental work done and needed a soft tooth brush because my gums were painful.  </li>
            <li> I brush my teeth, gums, tongue, roof, walls and floor inside my mouth at least 4 times a day which use to sometimes cut or inflame the tissue.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy these because I hate soft toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Also, like I said before, I normally hate soft toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Dr. Collins sucks!</li>
            <li> I know, dumb.  </li>
            <li> Significantly cutting down on flossing time.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are VERY hard.  </li>
            <li> This is apparently a very common problem as we age.  </li>
            <li> The head is not too thin like some-fits the mouth</li>
            <li> The bristles are thin &amp; tips are tapered to a point</li>
            <li> bristles on this brush are thin and get in between your teeth.</li>
            <li> In the past, my toothbrushes felt like they were cutting my gums.  </li>
            <li> Battling tooth enamel loss due to Soda :(  </li>
            <li> Before using these toothbrushes my gums would bleed terribly after nearly every brushing.</li>
            <li> hope this experience is not the mere effect of changing a toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t that expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they were out of stock that day</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even that expensive at all anyways</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was a one-time purchase at the commissary.  </li>
            <li> Scary..</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I found these brushes on Amazon while browsing random stuff and decided to order them along with the Restore toothpaste (which I am holding off on reviewing until after another dentist visit).</li>
            <li> The end tips are angled and diameter if each strand is very thin...</li>
            <li> None of that stupid crazy grip, stupid colorful bristles, or retarded packaging.</li>
            <li> Other brushes were just brutal!  </li>
            <li> Really unhappy with these.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about these as others were -</li>
            <li> no \\&quot;whitening cups\\&quot; and \\&quot;rubber scrubbers\\&quot;  and crazy colors</li>
            <li> I have moved on, sorry Doc!</li>
            <li> wrong!</li>
            <li> I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> I hate the contoured brushes because it&#x27;s so difficult to brush thoroughly with them.</li>
            <li> &quot;    Read for yourself: [...]</li>
            <li> :-((  </li>
            <li> these aren&#x27;t nylon crap their polyester.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would still brush that area and make myself miserable.</li>
            <li> I hated this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a horrible flosser,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the feel of these brushes and the reach with the compact head.  Good hold and quality.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used! I love the way it fits in my hand, I love the soft bristles, I love the size of the toothbrush head, I love how my gums no longer bleed when I brush yet my teeth still feel super clean.  If you are wavering at all on buying these, don&#x27;t.  Just buy them, you will never regret it.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL TRULY LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH .. PAIRED WITH PERIO TOOTHPASTE... THE VERY BEST FOR YOUR TEETH</li>
            <li> You will brush longer. It&#x27;s soft on your gums and gives them a great massage, soft on your teeth, the bristles are sturdy yet incredibly flexible, and it rests flat on counter tops so you can apply toothpaste with the brush sitting on the counter without fear of it rolling over and paste getting on the ground. This brush also lasts much longer than a standard toothbrush. A good buy!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush that really cleans and gets the job done without being too harsh on my gums. Would I buy it again? No, I was expecting to be wowed with it annd notice an overall difference in my oral health but not much has changed. I get the same results with 99 cent toothbrushes so why bother with the price and shipping? I&#x27;m happy with the brushes and I think it&#x27;ll last me a good year or so but I&#x27;ll be looking into electronic toothbrushes next time.</li>
            <li> Anyone that needs a soft toothbrush will appreciate this one...these are very soft and gentle, yet get the job done. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are probably the best manual brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. More effective at removing stains than even the hard bristle premium brushes (which are impossible to find now), and these are super soft! The head is angled properly and I can even reach the back of the molars (without wisdom teeth; removed). The wear indicators let me know when the brush needs replacement and at an average use of 2x daily they last around 4 months (2 minute brush time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YouTube these brushes to get an idea of the most effective way to use the unique bristle design while brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush isn&#x27;t going to work for me.  I found it very abrasive to my gums and the bristles are so long that I can&#x27;t fit the toothbrush into the space to reach the back teeth.  I purchased it because an overwhelming number of people said they loved it.  Happy for them, but it didn&#x27;t work out for me.  My husband, who can use any toothbrush, will be using these.</li>
            <li> The only tooth brush that I have found that does not hurt when brushing. If you really need a soft brush that lasts a reasonable period of time, this is the one. I buy them in a pack of three and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes because they&#x27;re super soft, which is what I need and can be difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I hardly feel like its brushing its so soft. It does a great job brushing my teeth and its not to expensive</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes if you need soft bristles! Try them and see; if you really don&#x27;t like them, they&#x27;ll make great guest brushes. Can&#x27;t lose for the price.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are amazingly soft and comfortable yet manage to sweep away debris that my stiff electric can miss.  I&#x27;m an invisalign patient and have previously gone through perio treatments.  I need to brush 4-5 times a day due to my Invisalign and my mouth was taking a beating from that much exposure to my electric brush.  These brushes are great for getting the job done comfortably.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I will use these from this point on.</li>
            <li> I think the stars say it all !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a search for a super soft toothbrush for a long time as I tend to brush away my enamel with the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; brushes that I&#x27;ve used throughout the years.  Once I started using this brush it felt like a was brushing with velvet or some other pleasurable substance.  I felt like the bristles were really getting my teeth clean with the least amount of wear and tear.  My husband felt the same when he used his new brush.  I&#x27;ve recently purchased a lot more of them and have distributed them throughout my extended family.  I want people to know what they are missing.  It&#x27;s the \\&quot;cadillac\\&quot; of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft, I love this toothbrush and I will continue to use it for as long as I can. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing toothbrush.  I originally received one for free and I thought it was a really strange looking toothbrush.  I gave it a try and wow is it fantastic!  The bristles are super soft and gentle and leaves my teeth with that squeaky clean feeling like I just came from the dentist.  It also lasts forever.  It is truly the best manual toothbrush on the market and the cheapest since it outlasts conventional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I find the Perio toothbrush very soft &amp; gentle on the gum. It also effectively cleans between teeth. I used to buy Oral B , but even the extra soft oral B brushes do not compare to these in terms of softness. Dr. Collins Perio&#x27;s toothbrush is now my favorite. I will now only use this brand and the Colgate 360 Sensitive Pro. Oh, and I love the assorted colors of toothbrushes that came in this order too! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Very gentle bristles. It cleans your teeth without damaging&lt;br /&gt;the enamel. If you want a clean mouth and gentle bristles that&lt;br /&gt;work on teeth as well as gums, this is the brush to use. Use a good toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;with it. I loved it with this one:[[ASIN:B00206DXQ0 Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Toothpaste (4.4 oz]]</li>
            <li> Very good quality! The bristles on this toothbrush are perfect.</li>
            <li> when I used this my teeth feel sensitive, but I have never had sensitivity on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. The head is a nice size and the bristles are very close together, much closer than standard toothbrushes and they are very soft. It is just what I was looking for in a toothbrush. I have bought extra soft toothbrushes from oral b at the store but these bristles are softer; however due to their compactness, my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> We used to buy a Japanese brand of toothbrush when we were living overseas and were very disappointed to not be able to find something similar in stores here in the US.  Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush is as close as we have been able to find anywhere and possibly even better than what we were using before.  The bristles are extremely soft, as our dentist has recommended, and they seem to get below the gumline and clean between the teeth better than any toothbrush you&#x27;ll find in the store.  I have a permanent retainer affixed to my front teeth, top and bottom and this toothbrush makes up for the fact that I can&#x27;t floss very well between the wires.       This toothbrush is a definite need for anyone with senstivie gums or gum disease.  They are a tad pricy, but the bristles don&#x27;t wear out or fall out as fast as they do in a typical toothbrush.  We just sterilize them once a month in hydrogen peroxide and they seem to last forever.  We bought kid-sized versions for our children too.  The gentle clean is well worth the cost in my opinion, as keeping your teeth and gums healthy is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am confused as to how this product received so many 5 star reviews.  Did every employee at the company purchase a toothbrush and review it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 40.  I have receding gums.  My teeth are highly sensitive.  Recently, I had an appointment with my periodontist.  He indicated that it was crucial for me to use an ultra soft toothbrush.  He recommended that I spend the extra money and purchase the G*U*M brand of brush.  I wish that I would have listened to him.  I went against his advice and was won over by the star ratings of this brush.  BIG MISTAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush IS NOT soft.  The bristles are VERY hard.  If you were to press the bristles on to the back of your hand, it would leave an indentation.  The bristles do penetrate through the space between each tooth.  Why?  Because the bristles are as hard as needles.  If it was a soft bristle, it would not be able to push all the way through the spacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has left my mouth sore after each brushing.  My gums bleed.  I end up taking a Tylenol after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may wonder why I&#x27;m still using the brush (I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times now)?  It&#x27;s my only brush in the house right now.  I have the G*U*M brush on order.  It can&#x27;t get here soon enough.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product, extra soft brushes, brush well without harming the gums. I have gum line recession, so I chose those brushes to gently clean my teeth. Really nice, and clean below the gumline without harming the gums. My son also uses it, he has braces and gum line recession, so, he uses those brushes and it works very well for him also. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect if you want a soft brush but are unhappy with the job that ordinary toothbrushes do. I&#x27;ve tried soft brushes before and always end up going back to a harder brush just because the soft ones never feel like they clean very well. This brush solves that problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and flexible, but the tips are so fine that they get into the spaces between teeth very well and also there are a great quantity/density of bristles so it does get your teeth very clean but is still very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is smaller than what is standard on regular grocery store brushes but after getting used to it, I find that the small size is much better for getting back into those rear molars and inside surfaces. I would not want to go back to a big brush after using this one. You will never jab or poke your gums with this because it just fits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this type of brush after using similar ones on a trip to China. I had a hard time finding these in the USA, but this brand and also one other (see my other reviews) are what I was looking for. It&#x27;s about time somebody improved on the old fashioned toothbrush, and with this one, they did. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> These are the SOFTEST toothbrushes I&#x27;ve found.... I had some dental work done and needed a soft tooth brush because my gums were painful.  The commercial &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes at my local drugstore were not soft enough.  I bought these and I could brush my teeth without pain.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Although there was a tendency towards fewer sites with gingival abrasion with the a tapered toothbrush, it was less effective than the a regular toothbrush in the removal of plaque biofilm and reduction of bleeding.\\&quot;    Read for yourself: [...]</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner after brushing, honestly. I make my own toothpaste at home, and I really enjoyed the combination of this brush and my toothpaste.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes feel different than any other toothbrush I have ever tried. That being said, they also leave my teeth feeling cleaner that other toothbrushes, even electric.  Where other toothbrushes have been rough on my gums, these toothbrushes have improved the health of my gums, even in a spot where there was mild receding occurring.  Give these a try!</li>
            <li> Excellent. very fine and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth, gums, tongue, roof, walls and floor inside my mouth at least 4 times a day which use to sometimes cut or inflame the tissue. I would still brush that area and make myself miserable. Oh, ick!  Maybe that&#x27;s more information than you need. Since I discovered Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrushes I can scrub hard and as often as I please.</li>
            <li> I used to buy a different style of toothbrush every time, then I got a prototype of one of these a few years ago as a free gift for buying a rather expensive mild-flavor sensitivity toothpaste &amp; now I won&#x27;t use any other kind of toothbrush. They brush, floss, &amp; leave your teeth feeling as polished as if you&#x27;d just walked out of a dentist&#x27;s office. If you have sensitive teeth &amp; detest electric toothbrushes, these Perios are your best bet. I also use them to massage my gums &amp; roof when they get toast-scrapes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are soft and yet they do get my teeth very clean, that is as long as the bristles are not worn.... and that is the one flaw. The bristles, for me, do not last for more than three weeks, and so I go through about three brushes every two months. Not really so bad... I just wished they would last longer. But I will certainly keep buying this brush until something better becomes available.</li>
            <li> There are smaller version of similar to these, they are ok. But those are perfect, and the price isn&#x27;t bad also.&lt;br /&gt;I tried different types of those brushes, and those seems like the most effective, and soft enough. Thanks to ppl who came up with such brushes.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to use soft bristles yrs ago.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this brand.  The bristles are divine;&lt;br /&gt;you can tell it&#x27;s a well made brush.  Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is like nothing I&#x27;ve tried from the store.  I have an electric professional oral b brush, and I truly doubt I will ever use it again.  I love this brush and how it feels against my gums and teeth.  Simply love it.</li>
            <li> I just had some extensive perio work done in my mouth (my penalty for not going to the dentist for 5 years) so everything has been more sensitive since then.  The dentist tried to get me to buy some $200 power brush but I heard about these through the grapevine as a great perio alternative.  And they work great.  Even though they are so soft, they still last quite a long time and get everything nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The reason for the 3-star review is that I would rather recommend these toothbrushes for kids rather than adults. These brushes have very soft and gentle bristles and will not clean adult teeth well. But b/c kids&#x27; enamel is thinner and their teeth are more fragile, I would hand these toothbrushes to them. The brushes with nylon bristles sold at stores are too abrasive for children&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> I think the toothbrush is fine, if not as miraculous as some reviewers here claim.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little put off that the toothbrushes came with a dentist&#x27;s name and phone number on them. It&#x27;s not like that having something printed on the handle is affecting how i use this brush- but it is just weird to order something you expect to be a new product- but it seems to be some sort of leftover overstock product.</li>
            <li> I started to get receding gums from brushing to hard and to much. These really help.</li>
            <li> love these.  so much softer than normal brushes.  yet firm enough to feel right.  doesn&#x27;t irritate gums or anything.  little expensive, but they do last quite a bit longer than normal brushes, so i think they come out to close to the same.  this is my second set and i plan to keep using these as long as i remember to order em.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  It is soft but cleans really well.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing away my gums anymore.  I doubt it&#x27;s related, but my hygienist said I went from 5m pockets to 4m pockets in one place in my mouth, so that was an improvement.</li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other toothbrush.  Soft on the gums, but cleans my teeth perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to write home about.</li>
            <li> You can brush as hard as you want and it will still be soft in the mouth, if you&#x27;re worried about gum soreness or recession.  It has extremely soft bristles.  My only concern is that it looks like the \\&quot;filaments\\&quot; might eventually get loose as they look a bit flimsy and sometimes crooked, but apparently they are supposed to last longer than standard nylon bristles that most brushes have.  You can really see up close the tiny filaments at the ends, and some of them curl slightly at the tips.  The design is tapered at the ends into tiny polyester filaments so it gets deeper down into the gums and tiny spaces.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much as good as it gets, at least from what it looks like now.</li>
            <li> Like flossing while you brush because the tiny bristles really get in there between the teeth.  Very soft brush.  Yet it cleans well and lasts a really long time.  Nice gum massage and my new favorite which I use in rotation with my Oral B Sonic thing (mostly because it has a 2 minute timer!)</li>
            <li> Just as described; this toothbrush is soft so it doesn&#x27;t harm the gums.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Like it because of narrow head and soft bristles - just ok toothbrush</li>
            <li> I am starting to see some gumline recession due to my overzealous use of that sonicare darling (seriously, do not use it more than once a day and very gently at that.)  It still cleans like no other but I can no longer use it daily so, in full blown panic mode, I&#x27;ve been searching for a really soft toothbrush, trying drugstore brand after drugstore brand.  They all got much harder with a few weeks&#x27; use and, mind you, I realize now they were never that soft to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received my order two days ago and I love, LOVE this toothbrush.  I cannot believe how soft it is.  It gently massages your gums, and yet, because the bristles are so fine, it also cleans your teeth very well.  As another reviewer mentioned, some of the bristles are longer to reach that tricky space between the teeth.  I think this is what it actually means to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; teeth.  I am now extremely outraged and offended by all those cheaply made (yet more expensive than the Perio!) \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot; toothbrushes offered at the drugstore.  Compared to this they&#x27;re more like scrubbers.  Honestly, you cannot brush with those without ending up scrubbing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/11/2012 UPDATE:  My original review still holds.  These are great toothbrushes and I&#x27;m back to purchase more.  The three I bought almost two years ago have lasted me well until now - the last one I&#x27;m using is not in any need of immediate replacement just yet.  They really do last a long time.  I wish I&#x27;d kept better track of how long I used each one but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  They hold up really well and I start thinking of replacing them only after the longer filaments start getting bent a little, so it depends on how much and how vigorously I use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time with receding gums. Soft toothbrushes in the store were still way too hard. I used these for a few months and when I went back to the dentist, my numbers were mostly 1 and 2s vs 3s.</li>
            <li> Since it seems there is only one model of extra soft toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever been able to find in stores, one that&#x27;s really not all that soft anyhow, I went on amazon in search of a real one. This toothbrush is great, one step away from velvet, and hasn&#x27;t made my gums bleed once like other brands do. If there&#x27;s any truth to these not being as effective as less-soft ones in getting rid of plaque, I&#x27;m just keeping a tougher grade toothbrush on hand to use (reluctantly) now and again. I just hope this product won&#x27;t disappear from amazon in my lifetime! Plus, the (standard) shipping was notably fast, faster than packages I ordered before it.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes clean teeth really well without causing bleeding or damaging gums. You wouldn&#x27;t think that bristles this soft would get the job done well but this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there. The claims are true...the difference is in the bristles. My teeth have that wonderfully sparkling clean shine and slippery feel, everyday...just like after having them cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> WOW finally here is a Perio toothbrush for older adults that actually is wonderful to use. I have lost some teeth and needed something really soft on the gums for daily use. My dentist said everyone should use a softer brush. The handle is comfortable to hold. The bristles are comfy however a tad smaller than a regular brush but does excellent. I would reccommend using this toothbrush for anyone with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Im always picking up \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes at many stores &amp; NEVER found a truly soft one. This one is just what I&#x27;d imagined! The head is not too thin like some-fits the mouth well. It&#x27;s perfect for anyone with problem teeth or gums. Teeth feel really clean afterwards too! I cant imagine using anything else after Dr Collins.&lt;br /&gt;PS I also use the toothpaste &amp; it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is oft for sensitive gums and is good for anyone who wants to protect their gums and the enamel on their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush also gets your teeth/gums very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides are that 1) food gets stuck in the brush so I have to clean it out occasionally and 2) I wish the handle were a little thicker. I think that 1) comes with the territory for a soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and receding gums, my dentist&#x27;s office suggested I lay off the Sonicare.. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this toothbrush! I feel like it is doing the job, but is very comfortable too!</li>
            <li> No toothbrush ever really seemed &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; to me. I did some research and came across the Perio toothbrushes and decided to give them a shot. They are truly soft and remain soft for quite some time. They also feel really good on the gums and seem like they get in between the teeth very well. I&#x27;ve had enough with all the fancy stuff other companies have come out with. These simple, soft toothbrushes leave my teeth feeling clean and smooth every time.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a friend who was undergoing chemotherapy.  They&#x27;re very soft and work very well for her.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to actually brush my teeth without being super worried and careful.  Other brushes were just brutal!  I am so happy with these!!</li>
            <li> Gum tenderness.  These brushes are just soft enough to let me get a good brush without bleeding to death. I like &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever used. Teeth feel cleaner and brush is easy on the gums. I would recommend Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush to everyone. I Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Battling tooth enamel loss due to Soda :(  These are perfect!  Super soft, but do the cleaning trick! So glad I found them here! I&#x27;ve never found super soft in stores.  :)</li>
            <li> Very soft, but very effective.  I know several Asian people who are always looking for a brush like this, which they could get at home, but have great difficulty finding in the states.</li>
            <li> Wonderful tooth brush.  My wife tried one of the three pack I got, and had to order three more.  This brush cleans my teeth, yet is very gentle on my gums.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothbrush I have ever used. After brushing my teeth feel squeaky clean like they do after having my teeth cleaned and polished at the dentists office.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth with the receding gums that come with age, which makes it worse.  After using this toothbrush for the last 3 months, I can honestly say that my gums no longer bleed after brushing, and they feel better!  The bristles are soft, which takes a little getting used to, but you can feel them hugging the gum line while you brush.  Kind of hard to explain if you haven&#x27;t used the brush.  Give it a try - just remember to brush gently and let the bristles do the work.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using these brushes for several years now and wouldn&#x27;t want to use any other brand. The bristles are so soft against the gums, yet do an excellent job of cleaning, even between the teeth.</li>
            <li> The softest toothbrush! It has helped me improve a recurring canker sore problem. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes in the mail a second ago and was a bit excited to test it out.  Very soft bristles, much softer than oral-b.  I have sensitive teeth and these bristles did not hurt my gums or teeth.  Glad I ordered these.  Too early to tell though how well they clean.</li>
            <li> No one should use any other toothbrush!!  SO SOFT - you know your teeth are clean without ripping up your gums in the process.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works very well for me. I like the weight and angle of the handle. I love the softness yet effectiveness of the brush. My gums/teeth are not as &#x27;sensitive&#x27; now that I have been using this brush for a few weeks. I have a tendency to brush too hard. I find with this brush, my teeth/gums feel they are getting properly cleaned, so I&#x27;m not over brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Soft enough to use around the insides of the mouth/cheek and of course the tongue, without scratching.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best toothbrushes I have ever bought. They are extremely soft yet firm enough to do the job on your teeth. I have burning mouth syndrome and regular toothbrushes hurt! I bought 3 more. my wife loves them too. Can&#x27;t recommend the enough. 5 Stars</li>
            <li> GOOD BRUSHES FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Great brush leaves mouth feeling deep cleaned, the way normal tooth brushes can not do.  Full sized head saves on brushing time.</li>
            <li> With some toothbrushes, I feel like I need to brush again when I&#x27;m through.  This one does a great job the first time.</li>
            <li> My gums were receding and my teeth were getting sensitive so I stopped using electric toothbrushes and switched to this tooth brush.  I don&#x27;t seem to accumulate plaque any quicker than with the electric brush but my gums are recovering!</li>
            <li> These are great tooth brushes. The softest I have ever used. They do a better job and are gentle on gums. Good for everyday and for after you visit the dentist.</li>
            <li> These have very soft bristles, in fact even softer than the children&#x27;s version of this same brand.  So I actually recommend these to adults but also to families with children!  My 2 year old prefers these over any other tooth brush because they are so incredibly gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been diagnosed with gum disease and have had issues with my gums. They can become easily irritated now when I brush. So I have searched high and low for a soft bristled toothbrush. All the store brushes labeled \\&quot;soft\\&quot; have been too harsh for me.. even the \\&quot;Dentist Recommended\\&quot; brushes.  FINALLY a toothbrush that actually IS soft! And it cleans really nicely! The tapered bristles really get in there. Of course you still have to floss and use mouthwash, but WOW this makes such a difference! I enjoy brushing my teeth it feels good now, instead of dreading it and trying hard not to irritate my gums. And the handle is so comfortable, it is perfect to get that 45 degree angle. It&#x27;s also a light weight brush and that seems to make brushing easier. And anything to make your brushing experience more comfortable to help you brush longer is what really matters in the end. As for someone in a previous review commenting about the name on the toothbrush making them feel like it&#x27;s a dentist advertisement. It&#x27;s just the name of the brand and most toothbrush&#x27;s have their namebrand on them. It doesn&#x27;t bother me how it looks, it&#x27;s how it performs that matters most! And this one gets 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li> Extra soft bristles gently cleans without abrasion for sensitive root surfaces. Keep medium and hard brushes for cleaning grout. Yay</li>
            <li> I am used to an automatic toothbrush, and to be honest, i miss by oral b automatic brush. BUT this toothbrush is waaay easier on my gums and teeth, as i have very sensitive teeth. my teeth feel very clean when i am done brushing with this perio brush, i only wish there was an automatic version. anyway.. if you don&#x27;t mind a manual toothbrush, and have needs for a soft head, this is the brush for you. LOVE how soft it is and how good it feels to brush my teeth/gums</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to get a extra soft toothbrush, this fits the bill. The handle is nicely angled and the head is a good size.</li>
            <li> Yup, definitely toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It is really soft, yet cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums. I used the colgate extra soft 360, but after they went up in price, and noticing that they lose they softness in less that 2 months, I looked into switching tooth brushes. I stumbled on Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrushes about a week ago. I bought them to try them and for the good price. 3/10 shipped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Perio toothbrush for 4 days, I see and feel the difference. My gums are not as sore and their color looks better; more of a pink hue than red. More importantly, I don&#x27;t feel that sore/ sensitive sensation as I usually feel with the 360. In addition, the design of the head and bristles do make the difference; I feel that the bristles get in between my teeth and eject food particles that my old 360 did not do well, and I can reach and brush my wisdom teeth much easier now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this experience is not the mere effect of changing a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good! I like this toothbrush very much and plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is what it claims to be. Very easy on the gums but I feel like it still cleans well. My only complaint is that a couple of bristles have come off under my gum line. Generally I&#x27;m happy with it though.</li>
            <li> This is a very good toothbrush.  I found one I like even better (softer and gentler on perio gums), but this one was my favorite until then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The even better toothbrush is the Nimbus Microfine:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LB8J06?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is so soft and good. Where have I been all my life. One simple thing and my life is made happier bc of it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft. I bleed less.</li>
            <li> It is soft and gentle on your teeth, but I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the handle.  it is a bit stiff with no curves to make holding it comfortable.  I am sticking to my Colgate Extra Soft brushes.  They are hard to find, which is why I gave this a shot.  I have moved on, sorry Doc!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleans better than the rest and it is feather soft on the gums. The bristles do not warp quickly and the bristles retain their shape well. This is the only tooth brush I will use. If I could I would give every human one of these toothbrushes because they are that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck,&lt;br /&gt;Matthew</li>
            <li> My dentist used to provide the sensitive style that you could not find over the counter so I searched Amazon and found exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have receding gums and I&#x27;ve been looking for a good ultra soft toothbrush for years. I&#x27;d been using the GUM brand brush but having trouble finding it recently. I saw this one on Amazon and read the reviews--and now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months I agree. The bristles are soft and comfortable. They don&#x27;t get brittle and hard like a few other brushes do. And they do a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started brushing, I said \\&quot;aaahhhhh\\&quot; - I have sensitive teeth/gums, and I have had no luck finding extra soft toothbrushes in the store.  This is perfect - the head is big enough and the bristles really seem to clean well despite their softness.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really good toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading about the polyester fibers being softer and longer lasting than the nylon brushes. WOW! They are not kidding. This is the softest, most gentle toothbrush I have ever used. I have used an electric brush for years (the former Crest, now Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush) and it does not compare. The Dr. Collins brush leaves your teeth much cleaner for longer and gently massages your gums. I never thought I would go back to a manual toothbrush, but I really love this one. Having had sore gums and some Perio problems I thought it was time to try some new products to better care for my teeth. I use this brush with Dr. Katz&#x27;s Perio Therapy toothpaste gel and Oral Rinse and it is working very well, sensitivity was gone for me in two days and keeps my mouth feeling much better than Sensodyne ever did. This brush does not hurt my gums and cleans better than the electric brush I had. The gentle action gum massage is fantastic! I thank the other reviewers for their excellent comments in helping me to find this outstanding product. If you have sore gums, have had oral surgery or have sensitive teeth and/or want to be gently on your teeth and gums, you will love this brush! I keep it sanitized with a Dr. Tung&#x27;s natural toothbrush cap. I highly recommend this product for better oral care.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! This is the first one that has ever given me a sensation in my gums after using it. I feel like this truly cleans my pockets and leaves for less flossing. Had perio issues with 3-7mm pockets all down to 3s now after using this and a natural mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Like brushing with clouds.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes.  The brush heads are soft and small.  The brush fits in my mouth perfectly and is easy to use.  Would recommend to anyone who wants a soft toothbrush for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> Good quality toothbrush, but not as soft as I expected. I recently had gum surgery and got a special &amp;#34;ultra soft&amp;#34; toothbrush from the periodontist. When it came time to replace the brush, I tried to find the same one and couldn&#x27;t, but I thought this would be a good substitute. Turns out, it&#x27;s not nearly as soft as the one I got from the office, and it seems roughly the same as my old &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brushes. Fortunately my gums have healed and I probably don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;ultra soft&amp;#34; anymore, but this may well not be soft enough for you if you are immediately post-op or have ongoing gum issues. But for everyone else, it seems to get the job done and isn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different toothbrushes over the years, never have I used one as comfortable as Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush.  Actually makes brushing your teeth enjoyable, and I noticed my teeth felt cleaner than after using other toobrushes.  I paid 10 bucks for a pack of three, and I feel like that was a steal!</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I was introduced to Dr. Collins Perio toothbrushes, but can&#x27;t remember by what dentist.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these toothbrushes ever since.  They&#x27;re great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time, I mistakenly ordered the child&#x27;s version, so I gave them to my grandchildren and placed another order of adult-sized Dr. collins Perio toothbrushes for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these toothbrushes to my friends, my relatives, and anyone else.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  So far, they are the best i&#x27;ve ever used.  I love how soft they are, yet they still clean your teeth really well without destroying your gums.  The bristles get between your teeth very well too.  I think my gums look healthier since i&#x27;ve started using them.  Love that you can buy them in a three-pack.</li>
            <li> Best ultra soft tooth brush I ever tried.  Easy on the gums, cleans the teeth well and lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! So soft, and almost no bleeding when i brush my teeth. I will gladly reorder. I wish they were a little cheaper though</li>
            <li> GREATEST TOOTHBRUSH EVER.  If, like me, you &amp;#34;saw&amp;#34; at your teeth and irritate your gums, this is your brush.  The fine tips clean really thoroughly without causing more gum recession or bleeding.  Using a regular toothbrush now feels like torture.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is perfect for my braces... very soft ,especially after they tighten or changed ,this is recommended</li>
            <li> My gum bleeds often so I really needed &#x27;truly&#x27; soft toothbrush. This toothbrush is absolutely AMAZING. It&#x27;s perfect and I love it.</li>
            <li> Was told by my dentist to get a super soft brush to prevent damage to my gums. I love these brushes! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very good product, soft on gUm. Will buy again !!</li>
            <li> this toothbrush has sharp fine brissles  soft good to scrape off all the plaque I love it I will be buying another</li>
            <li> I have an irrational fear of tooth decay. I used to have perfect teeth that were impervious to cavities and such, but in recent times, I&#x27;ve had cavities and the most recent filling actually required a crown. I&#x27;m not okay with that. I have good toothbrushing and flossing habits but I never achieved a super glossy clean with regular toothbrushes. Another problem was that my gums would become scratched and injured as I tried to scrub at the gum line. The dentist said to use a softer tooth brush, but I was using the softest tooth brush I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, I decided that Amazon&#x27;s ratings could help me, and you guys have not let me down in introducing me to the best toothbrush ever! After opening the packaging for the first time, I thought it looked kind of weird. It has a very basic handle and no fancy design. It&#x27;s just bristles and plastic. I felt the brush and it was quite soft and noted that the bristles did have a needle-like shape that would be helpful in getting between tight teeth (like my own) and below the gum line. After using it for the first time, I was amazed. I had read awesome reviews and was thinking, &amp;#34;How the heck could a toothbrush incite so much excitement in consumers?&amp;#34; Well, I am now one of those who have derived joy from this toothbrush. I haven&#x27;t had bleeding gums since the day I&#x27;ve used this brush, and after every cleaning I notice that they become more and more smooth clean. I normally have an unfortunate layer of biofilm on the top of my teeth next to the gum line that even flossing couldn&#x27;t tackle, but this brush makes it easier for me to scrub harder without damaging or wearing away my gums at the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also gave one to my mom, who is now beginning to experience age related gum recession. She doesn&#x27;t like anything. But this, she said was amazing and wants me to order more. So yes, this toothbrush is the best. I&#x27;ve already ordered a full stock of them for my bathroom backups.</li>
            <li> My teeth are in bliss!  The dentist keeps complaining that I brush much too hard... Now, she does not have to worry- these bristles are baby soft and my mouth is thanking me!!!</li>
            <li> Only toothbrush I use!!!</li>
            <li> I read about Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush in a magazine. I checked the reviews on Amazon and decided to try them. They live up to their claim. The bristles do a good job at cleaning. You actually feel squeaky clean. I am using them with Weleda toothpaste (another great discovery).</li>
            <li> I keep extra toothbrushes for all kinds of reasons and I really like the products that Dr. Collins makes, they are all pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> The best manual toothbrush for sensitive and receding gumlines.  I had braces earlier in life and brushed too hard on the gumline causing receding gums and sensitive teeth.  My dentist recommended i get a soft bristle brush and brush horizontally than vertically. I wasn&#x27;t able to get a good clean brushing horizontal with drugstore toothbrushes so i gave these a try. I&#x27;m so glad i did.  The bristles are soft, but just angled enough to get between the gumline and tooth.  Just be sure to replace your brush when they get worn out. Otherwise, you don&#x27;t get that good initial clean.</li>
            <li> Tired of the costco packs of regular toothbrushes I turned to amazon reviews for some guidance. At first I was skeptical when I read all the glowing reviews on the Perio but it wasn&#x27;t that expensive so I figured I had nothing to loose and ordered one. All I can say is WOW! The reviews singing the praises were true. After the first brushing I could tell the difference - my teeth had never felt more smooth. I&#x27;m now signed up with the subscribe and save for this brush, and also the  [[ASIN:B001792Y02 Dr. Collins  Restore Toothpaste, 4-Ounce Box]] - an amazing combo. Why they don&#x27;t sell either of these products at any store I shop in is beyond me. I guess Crest and Colgate have a monopoly with CVS, Rite-Aid, Safeway, etc.</li>
            <li> So at first I liked this product... I thought it was great... my teeth felt soooo clean... then my guns started hurting... then I went to the dentist and he was like &amp;#34;WTF did you do?&amp;#34;  My gums were receding hard and the only new thing in my dental regime was this brush.  I since switched back to a normal brush and my gums have come down a bit but still not fully repaired.  I don&#x27;t still have the box, but I think the one that arrived may have said medium or hard on the top, whereas the one pictured only says soft.  This may have been the problem, but either way, be weary... just because it feels like a good brush doesn&#x27;t make it a good brush.</li>
            <li> The handle is functional, mostly flat rather than round, and has textured pads to help avoid slipping. The narrow bristle tips do seem to get between teeth better than others. Only the tips (about 2 mm) are extra thin. The remainder of the bristle is thicker and stiffer.</li>
            <li> Such a fantastic purchase.  Very soft bristles that don&#x27;t hurt your gums.  Will definitely be buying more.  Can already see results.</li>
            <li> Really unhappy with these. I don&#x27;t like the feel of this toothbrush in my hands but most importantly it&#x27;s not extra soft like I wanted. I normally purchase nimbus toothbrushes witch feel great in your hands and are extra soft. Unfortunately they were out of stock that day and I needed to order.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome.  I think if I started using it in my 20s I would have less gum recession.  Other toothbrushes feel like scrub brushes compared to this one.</li>
            <li> Teeth are super clean and love the soft, soft bristles.  Definitely one of the best tooth brushes out there!</li>
            <li> Soft, durable - no complaints.  My gums say thank you for using this toothbrush.  It is just want I needed - my only regret is that it took so long to find the perfect toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Soft tooth brush and it works good on my teeth and gums. Well made product.</li>
            <li> Nice product but not my favorite...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, plus good delivery time - thanks!</li>
            <li> The enamel on my teeth is very thin, and this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t scrub off more enamel. I like it better than any other toothbrush, and have sent one of them to my ex-husband to try.</li>
            <li> Dr. Collins sucks! The handle broke few days after we bought it.</li>
            <li> Is the softer of all the toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried, without the chintzy give that other soft toothbrushes have, hence their &#x27;patented tapered ends&#x27;</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this toothbrush.  The soft bristles are recommended by my dentist and are great for getting around the gum line.  Will keep ordering these!</li>
            <li> I have gum recession and needed a gentler, softer toothbrush to brush multiple times a day, since I am using Invisalign.  These are perfect! They clean beautifully while being gentle on my gums. I wish I had found them years ago. I think I could have avoided some of the recession.</li>
            <li> This is a great product i initally bought these because i have a son that has sensitive gums as well as teeth so he doesnt like brushing. Hopefully these will help him to have better hygene with this. Product came as promised and the price was awesome. I would order these again as well as purchase from this seller. Packaging was also great. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> There is nothing great about this toothbrush. I used it for about three months because I paid for it and gave the other(s) away. If you want a plain old toothbrush, you could buy this one but you might as well go buy a store brand at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite extra soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive teeth.  Only problem is that after brushing, I sometimes have some film on my teeth.  Maybe you can&#x27;t have no irritation and perfect cleaning all at once.</li>
            <li> Theses are indeed softer bristles which I had to get used to. I found myself brushing harder than normal because I didn&#x27;t feel the abrasion I was used to with my other brushes. But you&#x27;re not supposed to brush hard as it will hurt your teethes enamel.  You don&#x27;t get to choose the color though. I had a green, pink and blue brush in my set.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush after gum surgery, no contest.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever used . Very soft bristles but very long lasting, Most people brush too hard with brushes that are too stiff. This brush minimizes damage should you brush too hard. (don&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a soft brush that gets the job done. This toothbrush is soft but cleans very well.&lt;br /&gt;Also the material last very long! I got the set of three thinking that if is soft it wont last... wrong! it keeps form for a long time. I got the set of three and I will have them for a long time ;)&lt;br /&gt;I definitely Recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;The seller sent it very well protected and in a timely manner! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I moved to US 2 years ago and couldn&#x27;t find the brand of toothbrush I used before (Victory). I want very soft one, but not too soft that it won&#x27;t do its job. I ordered a bunch of different soft tip toothbrushes just to try different brands, and this one is my favorite. The size is perfect, softness is great. I wish it comes in in more colors. I could only find pink and purple :(</li>
            <li> I tend to have a heavy hand while brushing so soft bristles are a must. I&#x27;ve found that even though a toothbrush is labeled &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; it&#x27;s still firm in my opinion , so I had to resort to buying kids toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;I finally found these toothbrushes after some browsing, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! These clean so well and are soft like I hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use my gums did feel a bit sore, like some other reviewers mentioned. But went back to normal right after. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it and I&#x27;ve been using it for months.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> great soft brush for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about these as others were - I don&#x27;t feel like they cleaned my teeth very well, they felt kind of weak.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush for sensitive teeth.  I don&#x27;t use mouthwash or any kind of spinning toothbrush anymore, because that also made my teeth extremely sensitive in the past. I now only use a Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush, (colors vary) (Pack of 3), it is the softest and most effective toothbrush that has fine long soft bristles that clean better under the gumline, and my gums around my back teeth aren&#x27;t sore anymore, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth either. This Dr. Collins Perio Brush is better than the Oral B toothbrush the dentist gave me. I also brush very softly and be careful not to brush too hard.  Read my review for the best sensitive toothpaste, that I use along with this toothbrush.    http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CBW5VK9ZJ0QY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00206DXQ0</li>
            <li> So glad I found these toothbrushes. I was first introduced to extra soft toothbrushes from my dentist due to receeding gums. However, being able to fine an extra soft that was not a child&#x27;s toothbrush was annoying. Glad I looked here. Love these toothbrushes. I was using a soft brush prior to finding these and I was having sensitivity around my gums. Got these and my gums feel a million times better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stunned. I actually could see and feel better clean the very first time I used it. I enthusiastically gave one of my three new brushes to my partner, who said the same thing.    This brush beats all others I&#x27;ve ever used.    Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I really like the way this toothbrush feels. I can tell that it is getting around every tooth because it is soft. What a difference! I always used soft toothbrushes, but these are so much better than you can get in the toothbrush section in the store. Perhaps a child&#x27;s soft would work as well, I don&#x27;t know. I cannot imagine going back to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrushes again. I do not worry about being too rough on the gums.</li>
            <li> work great - very soft!</li>
            <li> So this toothbrush is the best one I have ever used... Ever. It actually makes my teeth feel very clean. The FIRST USE, it had gotten rid of this hard layer on one of my wisdom teeth that I just couldn&#x27;t get off with my other toothbrush. The bristles are also VERY soft, and it&#x27;s rather comfortable for my gums. Totally worth the price (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even that expensive at all anyways but other reviewers did :O) So I would def. recommend this to someone.</li>
            <li> To me this toothbrush was too hard, maybe my gums are too sensitive ,but I had too find a softer one.</li>
            <li> The bristles on these are the softest I have used.  But not so soft that they are ineffective.  I wanted something gentle for my gums, and these fit the bill.  Just remember when brushing:  &amp;#34;gentle, but thorough&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with continued purchase of this item.</li>
            <li> I brush too hard. Good product</li>
            <li> I like it It is really soft</li>
            <li> This is the only toothbrush I have ever used that I had bristles that came out - had to pick some out of my teeth. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes I have ever used, I have been using them for about 3 years now and would never go back to regular ones. The super soft bristles glide in between teeth to remove plaque, while being super gentle on the gums. I&#x27;m remineralizing my teeth and this has helped by being so gentle. Absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Very soft but not sure if it actually cleans my teeth. Thats the only POSSIBLE draw back from this item. Other than that its perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gems and teeth so I don&#x27;t want to get the hurting feeling in my mouth anymore. I searched to get a soft toothbrush and bam! I love this toothbrush. I will order this one again after using these 3 (the package comes with 3).    I ordered those again and found they actually have different colors! The first time I ordered, I&#x27;ve got 3 hot pink toothbrushs but now I realize I can have different colors. Why don&#x27;t they let users have an option to choose colors? It was kinda weird to have all the same colored brush with my mom. Come on, don&#x27;t we recognize which toothbrush belongs to who by colors?</li>
            <li> I hope a long long time because this is the best performing toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used them all.  You can feel the difference the first time, so soft for how well the brush works/scrubs. I&#x27;ll never go back to nylon, ever.  If they wear well they are highly recommended!</li>
            <li> After trying \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes for several years, I decided to give these a try. Its very gently but I can feel it working into the cracks btwn my teeth more. They rock, they are awesome. Better than anything I can get in the store, even the health food store. I will only buy these from now on, unless something miraculously comes along thats better.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful toothbrushes!!</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I have ever used. The bristles are VERY soft, softer than any tooth brush I have ever used. It takes a minute to get used to, but it is perfect for sensitive gums. You can feels the bristles really getting in between your teeth because they&#x27;re so soft. Also, the narrow handle makes it very comfortable to hold!</li>
            <li> For timings of great lengths, my past enamelsweepers have most harmfully irritatinglies my gums. With great desperations, I browserered the Nile (TM) to find Dr. Collins Perio Enamelsweepers. Past generations of criticreviewers praise most excellentingly the feather-like softiness of the enamelsweepers, so I with interest much great orderbought the Dr. Collins Perio Enamelsweepers to ascertain the purportedly kingliness of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon with examinations most scrutinous, I concludings that this enamelsweeper is indeed of caliber most excellent. It&#x27;s bristlings of softiness anti-irritates my gums and makes my enamelsweepings most pleasurable. I would orderbuy this enamelsweeper again with antihesitation!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have really nice soft bristles. It feels wonderful on my teeth, can&#x27;t go wrong with these things. At the price it is a bargain.</li>
            <li> My gums used to always bleed after brushing my teeth. Not anymore!</li>
            <li> I guess many people haven&#x27;t used any other soft toothbrushes for comparison, but this toothbrush is not that soft. The problem is that the head is very big and the bristles very dense. The density takes away the softness because the bristles have no room to move. It ends up being close to regular toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is very good though. It seems to be more durable than regular toothbrushes. I have it for 4 months and it looks brand new.</li>
            <li> My gums are sensitive, so I&#x27;d been looking for a soft brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ones in the grocery stores by the leading brands that are marked &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; were too rough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even toothbrushes for infants were not soft enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve had is they fall out the backpack pocket where I keep them. But that&#x27;s my problem for not making sure the zipper is all the way closed.</li>
            <li> Is it my imagination or have \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes gotten harder and harder? At the same time extra soft toothbrushes have become nearly impossible to find. Thank goodness I just discovered the perio toothbrush. My gums thank you Dr. Collins!</li>
            <li> This plain looking toothbrush actually feels amazing.  The designer should be fired because I really almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of how it looks.  I mean my mouth feels amazing after using this brush. Amazing.</li>
            <li> Perio!!  Where have you been all my life????!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most awesome brush I have ever used!!  It is so soft, yet does a fabulous cleaning job!!!  I like it so much better than the Sonicare electric toothbrushes!  It cleans so much better!!  Really does a great job between the teeth, and also is so gentle on the gums but cleans the gumline very well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold for life!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush.  The bristles are extra-soft but yet firm enough to thoroughly clean my teeth.  Plus it is durable as well.  I replace my toothbrushes every 3 months but could easily use this one for much longer.  I used to order Oral B extra-soft toothbrushes but they stopped selling them on Amazon.  That&#x27;s when I decided to try Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush and I am so glad I did.  I will definitely order these again and again.</li>
            <li> I gave these one star after first buying them more than a year ago. I felt they were too soft, but my dentist convinced me to stay with them to protect tooth enamel and I now find my gums feel much better too. You have to change them every three months or so, but I now wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, particularly the name brands found in grocery and drug stores, which are complete garbage.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I felt like the popular brand of toothbrush my dentist was giving me was beating my gums half to death.  Brushing with my former toothbrush brand was uncomfortable, and if I tried to brush more gently, my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dr. Collins Perio brush is SO soft, doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums, and yet my teeth feel clean.  I&#x27;ve been using these for months, and my dentist has said my gums look good--which is a comment I didn&#x27;t usually get before.  Years ago I was told they were receding some, so that&#x27;s an improvement, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I have this toothbrush to thank for it because I haven&#x27;t made any other significant changes.  I would highly recommend giving this toothbrush a try if you are experiencing bleeding or receding gums.  It&#x27;s all I use anymore!</li>
            <li> Very nice tooth brush. Soft bristles an\d a nice small head.</li>
            <li> I seem to be the only one with this problem. The first time I used this toothbrush it did feel pretty good, but afterwards my gums felt like I&#x27;d brushed with razorblades. It&#x27;s been a week now and brushing now hurts every time, and my whole mouth is actually aching as I write this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth but haven&#x27;t had any problems with bleeding gums or sensitivity there before. I only bought this brush because I was buying a sensitive toothpaste, and stumbled upon it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occurred to me that maybe I was brushing too hard the first time, though I brushed as I normally would with any drugstore toothbrush (which I had been using previously, something Oral-B soft bristled), and have since decreased the pressure to almost nothing, but it still just _hurts_.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> I started recently having some problems, my teeth becoming sensitive. So I started looking for soft brushes and I bought different toothbrushes for toddlers that are describes as \\&quot;super soft\\&quot;. Well, Dr. Collins is the most gentle of all! (and bigger, those are kind of small, they designed for a small mouth) I&#x27;d definitely recommend if you have sensible teeth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how good this brush is. Cleans between teeth better than my old sonicare electric toothbrush. The individual bristles are quite thin, and there are about a million of them. Been using it for months, and still looks new. One reviewer mentioned it was a bit too hard at first. I ran mine under hot tap water for a moment, and that made it the perfect degree of firmness.</li>
            <li> I hated this toothbrush!  Not at all gentle on the gums and the head is way too big.  There are these weird long bristles around the edge that feel like scratchy whiskers.  The handle was pretty comfortable, though.  I&#x27;ve used the Preserve - Ultra Soft toothbrush for years and much prefer it over this for its appropriate sizing and softness.</li>
            <li> The main advantage of this toothbrush is that the brushes are made of polyester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and seems to reach areas between teeth and gums better than most. This booth brush, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t last longer than ordinary toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)Very soft. If you are looking for a soft toothbrush, this will fit your needs.&lt;br /&gt;2)Cleans well, but not so much better than the regular toothbrush that it will make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1)Doesn&#x27;t last very long. After two weeks, my toothbrush needed replacing. I expect my toothbrushes to last around 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;2)Somewhat pricey (although they brought down the price). But it is somewhat of a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great super soft quality. Feels weird at first then it&#x27;s great and any other &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brushes feel super hard. I have a tendency to brush too hard and these are the perfect answer for that. My dentist gives these and I needed one between cleanings.</li>
            <li> My dentist always yells at me for brushing too hard and always gives me a super soft toothbrush at the end of my visits.  I love the toothbrushes she gives me but I can never find anything even close to them in the stores.  Even the softest toothbrushes in the stores are ridiculously stiff compared to the ones my dentist gives me and they always cause my gums to bleed.  This Dr Collins Perio toothbrush is identical to the extremely soft toothbrushes my dentist always gives me.  I was very happy to finally find something like this, and it was cheaper for a pack of 3 than you&#x27;d pay for 1 or 2 toothbrushes at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect if you have sensitive gums! The bristles are VERY SOFT and don&#x27;t irritate used it after i came from the dentist.!</li>
            <li> I have three different electric toothbrushes (costing hundreds of dollars), but after some recent trauma to a molar, I had some serious sensitivity.  I tried Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush and love it.  Immediately ordered more along with the vanilla mint toothpaste (that does not make me gag like other mints).  I&#x27;ll keep several of these on hand for traveling and in case a house guest forgets to bring a brush!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and most toothbrushes I buy just aren&#x27;t soft enough even if they say so on the package. The Dr. Collins Perio toothbrushes ARE soft and sturdy. They are inexpensive compared to the so-called &amp;#34;extra soft&amp;#34; brushes sold in stores. Very happy and will continue to order these in the future.</li>
            <li> These are great toothbrush. This is what soft bristles should feel like.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush.  What a brilliant design!  The bristles are thin &amp; tips are tapered to a point so they get into crevices much better than standard ones.  They are a sturdier material (Nylon) that last longer too, so are more economical at the slightly higher initial cost.  When I checked online, it said some stores carried them, but I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  This was the best deal (cheaper than the gas to drive from store to store) &amp; will definitely refer it/them to others.  Ooh!  Maybe I should give them for Christmas presents to show others how great they work.</li>
            <li> This is my toothbrush from now on. It&#x27;s very sturdy and the bristles are nice and soft and fit under the gum line without doing any damage to the tissues. It reaches nicely between the teeth, especially with the bottom front teeth, where plaque accumulates badly for me. This toothbrush really makes cleaning that area easy as the bristles fit right into the teeth crevices. Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes will spoil you for the drugstore brands. I use a sonic toothbrush at night, but I can&#x27;t use it more than once a day, or my teeth get sensitive. These toothbrushes are really soft, but do a great job cleaning your pearly whites.</li>
            <li> These tooth brush is soft on the gum and still brushes your teeth pretty good. You get 3 tooth brush in the pack and they are well worth the price. These toothbrush are very flexible and would reach all places in your mouth. If you have sensitive teeth or receeding gum line, this is the tooth brush for you. I promise you if you try this toothbrush you will never go back to your old toothbrush again. The brittles is so fine it will get in between the teeth and clean the left over food out. Get it  and try it, you have nonthing to lose.</li>
            <li> no receding gums with these brushes. the fine bristles are great. this tooth brush plus arm &amp; hammer(floss and tooth picks) is all i need for a clean mouth!</li>
            <li> Unquestionably my favorite toothbrush! Super-soft bristles like no other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> soft but it turns yellow quickly!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new tooth brush and came across this one in my search. It had a lot of good reviews so I thought i would give it a try. I do seem to like it very much, the bristles are very soft on the gums. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve had one before this pleasant to brush with. Much better than the ones i&#x27;ve bought from the store. I would buy more when its time to restock on more brushes, so for now i will enjoy these. i would recommend.</li>
            <li> Wow!  After using this toothbrush, going back to a regular brush is like using steel wool.  My wife loves these too.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Simply the very best if you have gum problems. They are pricey but very soft and yet they feel like they do a good job in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> These soft, white nylon bristle toothbrushes are hard to find in stores.  I need soft bristles that don&#x27;t scratch my gums and make them bleed.  No matter how long I brush my teeth, my gums feel really great when I&#x27;m done.  The size of the head is just right and gives great coverage while brushing.</li>
            <li> After using many &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes I was still having issues with receding gums. Dentist recommended a soft brush but didn&#x27;t specify a brand, so I chose this one. Works really well, does the job of cleaning without hurting the soft tissues.</li>
            <li> WOW this is the toothbrush I have been looking for!! IT really cleans the teeth and doesn&#x27;t shred your gums! It is soft, it is just the right size and the bristles really DO get every part of your tooth. My teeth actually SQUEAK at times while using it!!! You don&#x27;t need to push hard, just gentle circular motions gets everything clean. I will never ever use a store bought toothbrush again, I will never use that electric toothbrush again. This is getting my teeth sooooo much cleaner, like coming out of the dentist chair everyday!&lt;br /&gt;I can actually feel my gums getting healthier! LOVE THIS BRUSH!</li>
            <li> The most immediate thing I noticed about this brush was how gentle it is to your gums. It&#x27;s the most comfortable manual brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush once you use these you wont want to go back to the typical mainstream toothbrushes thats a guarantee.. gotta restock, I cant keep using the same toothbrush month after month after month but Its damn sure not being replaced with a mainstream one so ill just have to reorder and wait.</li>
            <li> I have some receding gumlines, so my dentist recommended an &amp;#34;extra soft&amp;#34; toothbrush.  I was amazed how hard they are to find in the standard pharmacies and supermarkets, so I decided to look on Amazon and found these Dr. Collins Perio brushes.  I have been INCREDIBLY happy with them -- they leave my teeth feeling very clean, but they are EXTREMELY soft on the gums.  Another review said they &amp;#34;gently massage&amp;#34; the gums, and I think that&#x27;s a perfect way to describe it.  I&#x27;ve had no durability issues, as they seem to last as long as a standard toothbrush.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Hard to get excited about toothbrushes but this one I did.  I had been looking for a good toothbrush as the stores usually only carry two or three brands.  Saw this one and thought I would try it.  For awhile I looked forward to brushing my teeth.  That has passed, but I am still impressed.  Soft feel and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Compared to the 10-pack of ABC toothbrushes that I purchased from Amazon a few months ago, these aren&#x27;t all that great. They&#x27;re more expensive per brush and the bristles are also not nearly as soft. Not a bad toothbrush by any means, but it&#x27;s really not a soft brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very very nice. Best toothbrush i have ever used. The price is amazing also. Great purchase.... .</li>
            <li> My son has autism and does not like to have his teeth brushed.  When I used this tooth brush he said &amp;#34;thanks mom!&amp;#34;  He loves how soft they are.  Before it irritated his gum line.  Now he lets me brush.  Thank you for a  nice brush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  My teeth feel so clean after using it.  It gently massages your gums, and yet, because the bristles are so fine, it also cleans your teeth very well. As another reviewer mentioned, some of the bristles are longer to reach that tricky space between the teeth. This brush feels so much better than my previous toothbrush. Love it!</li>
            <li> It really gets em squeaky clean! Feels wonderful to use this brush. Never have I used a toothbrush that felt this good and worked this well.</li>
            <li> Needed a very soft brush for ulcerated mouth due to chemo.  These are very soft.  Would recommend for sore mouths.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve found for my receding and sensitive gums.  Very soft, yet efficient and effective at cleaning and getting into tight spots.  Outstanding product!</li>
            <li> I ran across this toothbrush under a different name on the discount shelf at our local military commissary.  Since it wasn&#x27;t a name brand apparently no one was interested.  I bought a few and fell in love.  Unfortunately it was a one-time purchase at the commissary.  I searched the Internet for 3 years before this Dr. Collins toothbrush showed up.  The ultra-thin, polyester  bristles are the trick.  I am an agressive brusher and wear out any other toothbrush in about 1 month, bending the bristles over.  And, the abrasive nature of all other toothbrushes leaves my gums a little raw.  With the Dr. Collins brush, my teeth get cleaner (gets into every nook and cranny), there is no abrasion and the brush lasts for more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s perfect in that I have sensitive gums.  The bristles are soft.  Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Upon first use I was hooked on this toothbrush. I have sensitive teeth &amp; used to get OralB Extra Soft brushes from my dentist (which were awesome), but I moved away &amp; they are hard to find in stores or online. I love the way this brush gently massages my gums &amp; teeth &amp; it&#x27;s actually better than OralB, which surprised me. Don&#x27;t be afraid that this brush won&#x27;t clean your teeth. It&#x27;s quite effective, &amp; I believe that being overzealous in the past with Crest Spinbrushes and similar products that have hard bristles caused my teeth to become sensitive over time, so be careful. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I must say that this toothbrush is truly the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was I thinking when I thought a hard bristle or even one of the supposedly \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes were really helping me keep my teeth and gums healthy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush is absolutely excellent all around. I can see and feel the difference in only a few weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are actually getting cleaner between the teeth, my gums are getting healthier, AND I am not having the continual irritations to my gums caused by ALL the other toothbrushes I have used for the last few decades...yes, you read that correctly, decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A challenge I have with this particular order is that they didn&#x27;t say that with the description of \\&quot;colors vary\\&quot; that it meant I would get all 3 the same color - dark pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the only one color, these were evidently custom printed for a Dr. Suzman (phone number also imprinted on the handle). It isn&#x27;t a big deal, especially since my name begins with Suz, and it feels a little odd to order something new and discover they are from a companies custom order. Perhaps Dr. Suzman has found a way to advertise thru Amazon...lol. I called the number and they are actually in Burbank, CA, very friendly, and give these out to their clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, great toothbrush and a generous gift to yourself for improving and maintaining healthy teeth and gums. [[ASIN:B0036ZA40W Dr. Collins  Perio Toothbrush,  (colors vary) (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> It feels like a cloud brushing against my teeth and gums, gently coaxed along by a calm breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a toothbrush that was softer than this and you&#x27;ll never have to fear your gums receding from these bristles... they&#x27;ll run towards them, anxious to be grazed by this angelic brush of good fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got the 3 pack and it&#x27;s well worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plaques off to you, Dr. Collins!</li>
            <li> Dr. Collins Toothbrushes are the Best there is!&lt;br /&gt;The store bought toothbrushes are so Stiff.  Even when they are labeled Soft (they are not).&lt;br /&gt;All the stores have the same brands and no Dr. Collins.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy when I looked on line and found that Amazon had this brand toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 3 pack...I will always Only buy Dr. Collins and with Amazon they were shipped so quickly too!  Only way to go![[ASIN:B0036ZA40W Dr. Collins  Perio Toothbrush,  (colors vary) (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> Amazing, soooo super soft! My dentist said i need to use a extra soft toothbrush! Cant find these at stores!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think a special toothbrush was going to make that big of a difference on my sensitive teeth. This one has helped immensely! No more pain whatsoever when brushing. I didn&#x27;t think that was possible without changing anything else about my dental routine. This is my new toothbrush for life.</li>
            <li> I have receding gums as most people that find there way to specialized tooth brushes. Unfortunately this one did not stop the gums from receding Further. I had to go to the dentist and get a nerve filling. I would stick to nimbus. It is much gentler.</li>
            <li> Softer than other soft tooth brushes that I have tried.  Will continue buying them.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a cheap yet fine haired toothbrush, and choose this one based on the good reviews. Have used it for awhile now and I find it adequate.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are teeth savers. Nice and soft, with a bristle configuration that helps get in between teeth as well as gums. My only regret is that I did not switch to these brushes years ago - before I developed problems resulting from too hard brushes. I have a tendency to apply too much pressure when I brush, even though I try to remember not to do that. Anyway, the Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush helps overcome that bad habit of mine, because the bristles are so soft. I ordered two sets of three as I like to switch my brush out every couple of months. I will buy more to have on hand for guests and travel. Never thought I could be in love or have strong feeling about any toothbrush, but I really am crazy about these.</li>
            <li> It may look generic, but don&#x27;t let its looks fool you. Easily the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. They really do feel awesome.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush. I think the price is reasonable, for a 3pack. People have teased me, though, saying that I&#x27;m paying for some dentist&#x27;s leftover personalized toothbrushes. haha&lt;br /&gt;I like them fine.</li>
            <li> Yes! This is very soft and the handles design makes it easy to brush with precision. I hope to keep my gums healthy until I die of old age.</li>
            <li> One toothbrush to rule them all, one toothbrush to find them,&lt;br /&gt;One toothbrush to bring them all and in the plaque bind them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God I am a nerd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is amazing!  It is so gentle on your gums and is the perfect firmness.  I&#x27;ve all the top electric brushes but I&#x27;m finding that a good manual is the best way to go ... and way cheaper.</li>
            <li> A great toothbrush alternative to my sonicare.</li>
            <li> Very nice...best toothbrush ever.  i am totally pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> this is more expensive than regular tooth brush. but this is really good for my teeth i htink. However, if you brush your teeth with like hard stuffs still stuck on your teeth it won&#x27;t come out bc this kind of tooth brush is not meant for that. It for sensitive teeth and it brushes gently. So if you have food stuch, then take those out with water or with tooth pick first before brushing with this. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The Dr. Collins perio works really well, it feels amazing on your gums and leaves your mouth feeling incredible clean, not to mention that it leaves your teeth pretty white. I am very pleased with this purchase, and after I use up all three brushes, I&#x27;ll definitely consider purchasing some more, as this product is great for the price.</li>
            <li> This product is really solid, much better than I expected. I read many Amazon reviews and bought it on a whim--I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it feels and how clean my mouth felt after brushing!</li>
            <li> This the best soft toothbrush I have tried.  Other brands sold in stores are soft the first or second time, but then they become hard.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get excited by a toothbrush but this one is so good, I had to add my two cents.  I had been using a soft bristled toothbrush for years and never found one that really felt soft.  The so-called soft bristles were still scratchy on my teeth and didn&#x27;t help with my receding gums.  I saw this one on Amazon and given the great reviews and good price I decided to order and am pleased with the result.  The bristles are perfect and they feel good against my teeth and gums, not scratchy, and it cleans my teeth exceptionally well.  The bristles are made differently than other toothbrushes I have used and I definitely prefer this type to others. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Highest quality, softest tapered toothbrushes. Dentist has been wanting me to get surgery for some time to give me more gum where its receding, but I keep putting it off because I&#x27;m not in pain thanks to these! (been using them for over 2 years now)</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever! I love how soft the bristles are! They&#x27;re soft, but they last much longer than regular extra soft brushes, which seem to splay out after a couple brushes.</li>
            <li> These are clearly very bare and simplistic toothbrushes. They&#x27;re bristles and that&#x27;s it. I like them, they are incredibly soft and I don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive mouth with them. They&#x27;re sturdy and not at all cheaply made. However, I do prefer the colgate 360 extra soft ones a little more, they just feel better on my teeth and give me a better clean. However, these are cheaper and stand in for a person who&#x27;s on a tight budget! I will definitely buy these again and have recommended them to my family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally sold on this new product I just recently learned about. Every good thing you&#x27;ve read that this product says it does is TRUE! Gets teeth their cleanest, and teeth feel smoother after brushing than with any other toothbrush. And the bristles are so soft that it actually feels good to brush your teeth; all those store toothbrushes that say &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; on them still always felt very hard to me. Finally, I&#x27;m still going strong on my first Perio toothbush and it&#x27;s been four whole months since I began using it, and not a single splayed bristle in sight. Looks like it&#x27;s going to be extremely durable and long-lasting, too!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this toothbrush. I ordered it after I found it on Amazon and read the great reviews. It is so soft and gentle on my gums yet it cleans my teeth fantastically. It looks so basic but outperforms all the other toothbrushes I have tried. I will be ordering more and giving them to my family.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft and therefore smooth on gums.  I only wish the size of the head should have been smaller.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Ordered  again  more Dr  Collins perio toothbrushes, we love em, and no cavies report from our dentist. We go for a teeth cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Every 6 months.. remember to foss  also.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m use to an electric tooth brush, but I like this I think better. After using this brush, I think my oral B was too hard&lt;br /&gt;on my gums, as the dentist notice my gums are starting to recede ! Scary..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on this brush are thin and get in between your teeth. Even though I floss everyday, I feel this also does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I have bought Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush&#x27;s, and I and my husband like them.&lt;br /&gt;In this pack all 3 toothbrushs have a different color so you know, Who&#x27;s is Who&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am an adult and wearing my braces and these are pretty cool. they are soft, small bristles so they can sneak in between your teeth and clean out the food and what not. I like them a lot, i normally switch it out every 2 months or so...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked all over for bristles this fine and soft on store shelves.  Finally came across these on Amazon and decided to give them a try.  Now I&#x27;m hooked, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll ever use, highly recommended.  I always brushed too hard, (habit I guess) and these at least soften the blow a little.  My gums are much happier!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used since my gums are very sensitive.  It cleans really well for having such soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Have been using the toothbrushes for a while now and am very pleased. They do not hurt my gums and the longer bristles get between the teeth with out making them bleed. Very good buy.</li>
            <li> I always look for soft toothbrush because I have to, or my gums would bleed. This toothbrush is super super soft that I have no worry about hurting my gums and teeth! Plus, it&#x27; s a bargain because you get 3 in a pack. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Will be buying these regularly. They are soft, the angle is perfect for getting to molars, and the design is simple. Not much more to say. Just among the best on the market, and you can get a good deal on them with the subscribe and save program if you get 5 products in one month and get the 15% off.</li>
            <li> My dentist have told me I brush to hard. But since I have started using Dr. Collins Perio my dentist said I was doing much better. She was surprised to learn that it was because of the toothbrush I was using.</li>
            <li> These brushes are quite soft and goes between the teeth. Much more effective than regular toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other micro britsle toothbrushes as well - but these last longer.</li>
            <li> This is the softest toothbrush I have ever used.  I would compare it to butter, or perhaps a butterfly wing.  In fact, if you just rub butter all over some butterflies and shove them in your mouth, as they futilely attempt to escape it will feel a lot like using this toothbrush.  Except I brush with toothpaste, not butter, most of the time.  So let&#x27;s save the butterflies and buy these toothbrushes instead.  Spread the word!</li>
            <li> Although more expensive than other competitors, this has THEE softest bristles I&#x27;ve ever tried...bar none!  I thought the super soft toothbrushes from Gum was good...this is even better.  The end tips are angled and diameter if each strand is very thin...so when you brush it actually digs between your teeth and gumline.  There is less pressure on my gums using the same stroke force when comparing to my other past toothbrushes.  I alternate using this and a Sonicare...latter works great on the surface, but overtime I think it&#x27;s a bit too harsh on your gums.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with my previous toothbrush so I ordered this based off of its stellar amazon reviews. This toothbrush did not disappoint. The bristles are very soft and initially it does not feel like it is doing much. I always thought you needed power tools and hooks to clean teeth like dentists do. I was wrong. This gentle brush is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums and my teeth feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel cleaner than they ever before. My tongue keeps rubbing my teeth because they feel so slick and clean.  I have been giving these toothbrushes out to my family and the only complaint is that now that their teeth feel so clean they really notice when they need to brush again. The brush doesn&#x27;t look like a race car, it doesn&#x27;t have multicolored bristles, but it cleans your teeth better than any other brush I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will be buying many more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are so soft!  I really love them.  After using, you should dry the bristles though, just take some tissue paper and squeeze the bristles; otherwise, you might start to see a brownish color on the bottom of the handle where the bristles go into the handle.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Very soft bristles that don&#x27;t irritate the gums, but still does a great job at cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the nimbus which is also available on Amazon, but they poked my gums and caused my entire jaw to ache due to the gum pain. I&#x27;m sticking with Dr. Collins Perio.</li>
            <li> The teeth must be treated with care. The gums also. This toothbrush was my best discovery. It&#x27;s soft, gentle, delicate and yet knows how to do a proper cleaning because it does not hurt the gums. Marvelous! I indicated to my friends and relatives. Besides all that, the package arrived very well done and the delivery was within the combined. I have only praise to do. Therefore is the second time I buy (a lot of) these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Oh goodness, they really are soft.  I wish I would have found these years ago!</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes came in a plastic baggie, opened.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have used and nothing else compares. It&#x27;s inexpensive compared to fancy electric ones, and works just as well if not better. My teeth actually feel clean after using it and my gums don&#x27;t feel assaulted.</li>
            <li> I was of the opinion that pretty much all brand name toothbrushes were the same.  I was wrong!  Polyester bristles are a major improvement over standard nylon brushes.  My teeth feel fabulously clean and polished- better than the clean you get with a sonic brush and light years ahead of standard brushes.  The thinner polyester bristles get between teeth and gum line incredibly well.  Significantly cutting down on flossing time.  I am using with Squiggle Tooth Builder toothpaste and am really pleased with the results - and knowing that I am not using chemicals or brushes that damage sensitive gums makes be a Dr. Collins Perio brush convert.

            <li> I wish I had this toothbrush my entire life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had super sensitive bleeding gums since I was like 18-19 (26 now) and could never keep it under control. Every time I brushed, blood everywhere. Nothing I could do about it except go for a teeth cleaning with the dentist. That only lasted a few weeks, and my mouth was back to bleeding again. Also my gums were always inflamed and red. Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT now that I&#x27;ve been using the Perio toothbrush for a week...HOLY mother of all that is sweet and awesome. NEVER, EVER, EVER going back to those other toothbrushes (Colgate, Crest, etc etc). The Perio has reduced my gum sensitivity and bleeding by about 90%. Amazing! The first use, I was like \\&quot;oh, my, god\\&quot; it felt SO good massaging my gums. My gums are slowly turning a healthy pinkish again instead of red and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered a tube of Xyliwhite toothpaste (non-flouride) [[ASIN:B000MGWIE8 Xyliwhite Non-Fluoride Toothpaste Gel 6.40 Ounces]] along with an alcohol-free mouthwash called PerioWash [[ASIN:B000I4C22C Nature&#x27;s Answer Periowash Alcohol-free Mouthwash, Cool Mint, 16-Ounce]] and I&#x27;ve never felt cleaner, fresher, and healthier in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;26 years of using crap toothpaste with fluoride and other junk, using ridiculous hyped up marketing super colorful toothbrushes, and that harsh mouthwash that makes you wanna cry...NEVER AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I LOVE the simple, sleek, lightweight design of the Perio. None of that stupid crazy grip, stupid colorful bristles, or retarded packaging.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and tender... Good for people with tooth sensitivity like me. Added with Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Toothpaste, there is no better relief!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever had. For the first I can brush my teeth without worrying to bleed. :)))))</li>
            <li> I am over 60 and I did not think that a toothbrush could ever be a pleasure to use until I tried this one. I sincerely don&#x27;t think that anyone who tries it would ever want to use another brush. All other toothbrushes should be outlawed!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much better this toothbrush feels compared to the grocery-store brushes and even Oral Bs I&#x27;ve been using! The fine bristles really do get between my teeth, and they massage my gums, too. Before, I&#x27;d tend to \\&quot;forget\\&quot; to brush my teeth (really, avoiding brushing) because it didn&#x27;t seem to do much or last very long. Not so with this brush; my teeth feel polished and clean when I&#x27;m finished brushing, and I actually look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I found these as an alternative to the sonicare which totally fixed me about 15 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I has peridontal treatments done at the dentist 15 years ago.  I did not know my dentist at the time was a quack.  I went every year since a kid.  Any inkling of a cavity was filled.  I did it all.  I was early 20&#x27;s.  I did not realize that bleeding gumlines was not normal.  I know, dumb.  But... i found the sonicare and back then they guaranteed right on the box, to cure gingivitis and peridontal issues or your money back.  So, can&#x27;t go wrong, right?  YOU BET!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then it was time for something new as my gum lines were getting very sensitive.  They were receding. So the hunt was on for a good quality super soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried ABC, ORAL B, COLGATE and many other brands i don&#x27;t even remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These by far, are the greatest brushes ever made, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had a cavity since using these and my gumlines are healthy again.  Sonicare now makes a soft brush so i switch between this Dr. Collins Perio and the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to everyone, despite their high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, i would not recommend more than one or two until you know if you like them simply becuase they are expensive.  If you like them, buy them by the dozen, it&#x27;s cheaper that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, these actually last a good 2 to 3 months, not the typical 30 days.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes. The tapered polyester bristles last a very long time and have saved my gums from wear and tear.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is SUPER soft just like advertised.. but it&#x27;s too soft to clean your teeth!  Doesn&#x27;t scrub away everything like a normal toothbrush would.  TBH I use a Walgreens brand soft toothbrush now and it&#x27;s perfect and is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes. They are soft enough not to irritate my mouth, which is very sensitive. I will not use any other kind of  toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and gums was was looking for a toothbrush that is gentle to use.  I have not found this toothbrush to be the answer for me. It is better than some.  But I finally was given a softer bristled toothbrush by my dental hygeniest called Plak Smacker Ultra Gentle.  It works!  I have yet to find them in any store so I can purchase it myself.</li>
            <li> The longer the bristles, the softer toothbrush would be,apparently.&lt;br /&gt;This brush have short bristles so... apparently its not going to be as soft as &amp;#34;GUM&amp;#34; company toothbrush would.&lt;br /&gt;The density of the bristles can also affect the softness in-general. On this brush density pretty regular for the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; type of toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I like is the needle/like edges of the bristles, witch is good for cleaning gum&#x27;s, for no longer than 30 sec, apparently ;))).</li>
            <li> I only ordered it because of the combination of it being the highest rated and most popular, and im glad I did. softest bristles i&#x27;ve ever come across. I actually enjoy brushing my teeth now.</li>
            <li> I was having problems with my gums bleeding every time I brushed.  This toothbrush put an end to that and feels very nice.  It still cleans my teeth well and leaves them with that smooth feeling.  I also like the fact that I can get around my back teeth easily because of the smaller hear and bristles that seem to reach further in.</li>
            <li> I use a Soniccare Toothbrush, but sometimes when it needs a charge ---or sometimes I just feel like brushing manually I&#x27;ll grab an old fashioned tooth brush.  I heard that soft tooth brushes are the best to use, but It always seemed to me that soft bristles wouldn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well.  I purchased this inexpensive pack of 3 soft toothbrushes based on reviews.  Yes, soft toothbrushes will get your teeth clean IF you purchase this brand.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will buy Dr. Collins tooth brushes here on amazon again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare for the last 8 years or so and I have always heard/considered it to be the best. In fact, as my Dad is a dentist himself, I&#x27;ve seen first hand the number of people who swear by the sonicare... I like this Perio brush better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Perio with the idea of a travel brush so I don&#x27;t need to pack around the charger and stuff... After reading all the positive reviews I was expecting a GOOD brush, but I was surprised to find out its an AMAZING brush... takes a lil longer to use than the sonicare, but my teeth and gums are actually cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dad has always said a good toothbrush should have very soft bristles, but it seems all the other brushes today are multi-colored, multi-angled, stiff bristled things that have all kinds of great featured that really tear up your gums. This brush feels so good on the gums and cleans even better. Simply put its my favorite brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought the six pack, but if anyone is looking for reviews they&#x27;ll hit this spot so I&#x27;m adding it here. I just used my newly arrived brush for the first time. Know what it feels like to have every single one of your teeth flossed 360? No? Neither did I until now. Maybe if they&#x27;ve done a major cleaning at the dentist and a professional hygienist has hovered over you with his/her assortment of sharp metal picks, hooks, and scraper, but you can&#x27;t do this kind of floss job with a strand at home. The bristles themselves are so soft, it&#x27;s like velvet rubbing on your teeth and gums. But you can feel them going between your teeth all the while. Now I&#x27;m not going to pretend I&#x27;m one of those ultra conscientious and fastidious dental hygienists that brushes and flosses completely 3 times a day, but I do brush every single day. With three little kids, that&#x27;s most times the best I can do. To get a halfway decent floss job done, I&#x27;m in front of the mirror for 10 minutes after they&#x27;ve gone to bed going through all the things I could/should/ and would rather be doing with those 10 minutes of peace and quiet in my mind. And when it&#x27;s all said and done, I know it&#x27;s not all clean because there are places I just can&#x27;t reach no matter how hard I try. My husband also can&#x27;t find a toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t hurt him. \\&quot;Extra soft\\&quot; and \\&quot;Ultra soft\\&quot; still hurt him and he has excellent teeth and gum health so it&#x27;s not because he&#x27;s got an issue. He threw out all of his other brushes as soon as he put this brush on his teeth after just having said, \\&quot;lets hold onto our other brushes in case we don&#x27;t like these.\\&quot; Now I&#x27;m not going to say I feel like a dollup of a cloud like substance was just rubbed over my mouth. I felt it. I felt it working. And I&#x27;m still feeling that bit of sensitivity after a really in depth flossing. But no where near the pain or discomfort of a professional cleaning or traditional flossing. I&#x27;m actually excited by the prospect of having this clean feeling being a part of my daily routine without all the time, effort, and hassle to get less than ideal results. Buying more for the rest of the family and replaced our kids brushes with the kid version!</li>
            <li> Super soft and easy on the gums. Best toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> This is a really good toothbrush - makes me wonder why I was using other crap on the market. The wife loves it, and I have ordered some for the kids.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a super soft bristle toothbrush and the Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrushes were just what I was looking for. I will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> Excellent tooth brushes, nice and soft.  Lasts quite a while too!</li>
            <li> Very effective toothbrush, didn&#x27;t find it too hard like some people reviewed.  Does a good job of polishing the teeth, massaging the gums, and the angle of the brush makes it more effective.  Be careful, though, the angle makes it easy to press a little too hard while brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother the areas of my teeth where the dentin is showing.  It also stays soft over time and does not harden after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Super hard tooth brushes. Made my teeth and gengives bleed! Refund ASAP.</li>
            <li> What a difference in my teeth. These are great. I&#x27;m never buying a different type or brand ever again! Super soft and you really feel a different kind of clean feeling after brushing with this</li>
            <li> Great truly soft toothbrushes. My teeth and gums love this toothbrush. The bristles are soft, the head of the toothbrush is perfectly sized for my relatively small palate. Perfect.</li>
            <li> These have been my ideal and favorite toothbrushes. I used to often bleed or hurt my gums with other brushes until trying these. Although these are soft, the cleaning feels flawless and perfect. My mother, on the other hand, does not like them due to liking medium/hard toothbrushes. I really believe she can brush with a cactus if it had enough bristles and be fine. However, coming from someone who has never had a cavity, these clean just fine while my gums remain happily intact ;)</li>
            <li> I have always been very particular about my toothbrushes.  I prefer a very soft toothbrush.  This one is so soft.  In the past, my toothbrushes felt like they were cutting my gums.  This is so gentle yet strong enough to get the job done.  My gums felt great.  Thanks, Dr. Collins.</li>
            <li> Seems much better than the other toothbrushes I&#x27;ve purchased. Last quite long so I still have many of them left over a year later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushes for about a year and am very happy with them. I also use a Sonicare, but now only once a day; for the 2-3 other brushings, I grab the Dr. Perio. These are especially good if you have sensitive teeth and/or gums. Good quality. Soft but the bristle arrangement works well for cleaning, even between teeth and at the gum line. I actually do get that &amp;#34;hygienist clean&amp;#34; feel on my teeth with the Dr. Perio brush. I&#x27;ve purchased sets of three on 2-3 occasions. I alternate between them so they have the chance to dry well between uses. I change them out after about 3 months. If you want a good quality brush, you should be happy with these.</li>
            <li> I am going through chemo and my gums are very tender and bleed easily.  This is the softest toothbrush I could find (even the other toothbrushes that say \\&quot;soft\\&quot; on the package were too hard).  I use it at least twice daily and it leaves my mouth feeling tingly and clean.  Only problem is that it needed to be replaced after about a month of usage instead of two to three months for a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> this is the softest toothbrush that I&#x27;ve ever used. I usually buy extra soft toothbrushes, but this one is way better. Cleans my teeth better and I can brush my teeth for the recommended 3 minutes without hurting my gums and that&#x27;s important. It might be too soft for those with a heavy hand and might prefer stiffer bristles, but not me.</li>
            <li> I love this one. It is soft, but a little big for my mouth. Still I love it, want to buy them again.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very soft for the first few weeks, after that it starts to harden up a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find an easy fix for this however. Turn your sink to the hottest it will go, and run the brush under it for about 30 seconds. This really loosens up the bristles and restores the super softness. Just make sure you do it every time you brush.</li>
            <li> Such an awesome toothbrush! It&#x27;s soooo soft and the tapered bristles tickle. It makes it fun to brush. Very clean feeling after too. Extremely happy!</li>
            <li> I am glad I decided to try out a brand name I am not familiar with.It&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling,but it feels like a very fine brush with a lot more bristles then my mouth is used to ,frankly!It just feels different,and in a good way!i would definitely buy some more.</li>
            <li> have not used it yet,  I am confident that it will be good.  thanks, I will be using it very soon.</li>
            <li> If you are one of those who find the so-called extra-soft toothbrushes too hard, you should try this one. This is the best toothbrush I ever used.</li>
            <li> Im writing this review immediately after using this product. There only a few times in your life where you come across something so good you want to run down the street and tel everyone about it whether it&#x27;s big or small and that&#x27;s how I feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I feel anger thinking of how many years I have abused my teeth with the trash these major companies are putting out to brush teeth with. You really start realizing how bad these popular toothbrushes are when you have something like braces(which I do) and you start noticing  how much their hurting your gums. This pain and frustration is what made me buy this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon just touching the bristles for the first time I knew this was something different, as states these aren&#x27;t nylon crap their polyester. When brushing not only did I not feel irritation in the slightest, but I really felt the cleaning power, they really get in there and do work. Also the size of the head is great it&#x27;s long but not too thick, I can tell much thought was put into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also makes me see how all these other toothpastes are really marketed with their bell and whistles just to suck more money out of consumers when ALL we need is a standard brush no \\&quot;whitening cups\\&quot; and \\&quot;rubber scrubbers\\&quot;  and crazy colors it&#x27;s all a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending this to all of my friends. I had seen these in amazon before but thought hey how much difference can a toothbrush make aren&#x27;t they all the same but after using it I&#x27;m realizing this toothbrush can save thousands because half the reason our enamels are wearing off is because of the sandpaper-on-a-stick were all buying, even IF you buy the super soft expensive stuff like I have. brushing with this saves teeth and my gums so dr Collins you got a lifelong customer</li>
            <li> I recently got braces and needed a toothbrush that would help clean and wouldn&#x27;t lossed the braces. This toothbrush is soft as advertised while still brushing the teeth well.</li>
            <li> Very happy to have found these wonderfully soft brushes. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush it is very soft and I feel it cleans better than the toothbrush found in the stores</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes get between my closely packed teeth. My teeth feel so clean and smooth after use.  I give out brushes to family and friends and they are hooked.</li>
            <li> The only dental problems I have had in life are the odd cavity, but I&#x27;ve never liked brushing with stiff bristled brushes. I found these brushes on Amazon while browsing random stuff and decided to order them along with the Restore toothpaste (which I am holding off on reviewing until after another dentist visit). This brush&#x27;s bristles are very soft, but still do a surprisingly good job at cleaning! After brushing, my mouth feels sparkling clean, so I plan to continue using these unless my dentist indicates they have caused a problem.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles - great toothbrush - feels like a mini massage in your mouth. Highly reccomend it! Great brush! Smile!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. The best I ever had. Soft and last long.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find such a soft brush as this in stores. The perio toothbrush is wonderful. The bristles are tapered at the ends like fine fur or filaments. It is also very easy to clean and the bristles don&#x27;t bend or splay as easily as on regular toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;I grind my teeth and have always had a tendency to brush too hard and have gotten toothbrush erosion as a result , but with the perio I feel like I am being kinder to my teeth. A great product and I will certainly re-order.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet:  Fantastic toothbrush, but don&#x27;t count on a color variety--my 3-pack came filled with all green ones. :-((  The super-thin bristles massage gums, get into tight spaces and is a perfect brush for in-between using my Sonic-Care every day. Highly recommended, I&#x27;ve used these for several years and have a sparkling smile with healthy gums !</li>
            <li> I needed a soft toothbrush with just bristles no plastic thingy&#x27;s or anything on them...these are great, really soft and decently priced&lt;br /&gt;I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy these because I hate soft toothbrushes. I was swayed, however, by all of the reviews. I&#x27;m glad I gave in, because these toothbrushes are the best I have ever used. Nothing has ever left my mouth feeling as clean, or as fresh-- and the feeling lasts all day. Also, like I said before, I normally hate soft toothbrushes. I used to buy regular &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; toothbrushes and replace them every two weeks so that they still felt new-- I was doing serious damage to my teeth (and my mouth) using these so roughly and so often.  Please, get rid of whatever else you may be using and get Dr. Collins brushes.</li>
            <li> These are pretty much the best manual toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used. They&#x27;re very soft and make it easy to not only brush your teeth, but your gums too.</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would be so excited over a toothbrush, but these are so different than the run of the mill drugstore kind.  The bristles are soft but dense and I get a great clean - just as if I had used an electric toothbrush, though not as harsh on my teeth.  You have to get these for the cleanest teeth ever!</li>
            <li> These are great and will reorder again at some time if still available.  A truely soft bristled brush. Better then anything in the local stores.</li>
            <li> I really like the density of the bristles.  However, I wish it came in a compact head.  The larger head is difficult to maneuver without gagging.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I have tried so far</li>
            <li> My periodontist recomended for my receding gum line. This tooth brush was very soft and easy on my delicate gums.</li>
            <li> To me it seems much softer than other brushes I have tried and much easier on the gums, I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great Toothbrush! These are very soft and easy on your gums. After a month, I have noticed a significant improvement of my gums. I would recommend this if you are looking for an affordable and effective toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I started using Dr. Collins toothbrushes a few years back and absolutely love them. They are gentle on my gums and do a fabulous job on cleaning my teeth/gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a horrible flosser, but I do go to my dentist every 6 months and he and his hygienist also give me compliments on the health and cleanliness of my teeth/gums.</li>
            <li> They feel nice.  The bottoms get gunked with toothpaste more so than other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My dentist has to special order extra soft toothbrushes and recommends only extra soft brushes.  It is odd that extra soft brushes are so hard to find.  Over the years using only soft brushes I have undermined my dental roots.  This is apparently a very common problem as we age.  A toothbrush like these is what we should have been using sine grade school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the first time I used these it felt soo soft I thought they would not work for me.  But after a few days I became accustomed and realized that regular soft are super rough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far these brushes are surprisingly durable, and a pleasure to use.  I have no dental troubles at all except for using too hard brushes for most my adult life hitch has caused some gum recession, sensitivity, and root erosion.</li>
            <li> You know that awesome, super smooth feeling your teeth have after you get them cleaned at the dentist? Now imagine having that every night before you go to bed. Yup, this toothbrush does that - without damaging your gums or stripping away enamel. It feels like a gum massage every time you brush your teeth. I wish it came with some kind of tongue cleaner on the back side, but other than that, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Have used the pero before and use has greatly improved my gum issues!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very soft and gentle. I use an electric tooth brush because I like for my mouth to feel clean and this toothbrush is prefect!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush (Pack of 3) while doing some research on teeth sensitivity products. I prefer soft tooth brushes and these toothbrushes are highly recommended by several forums. The first thing I noticed taking the toothbrushes out of the box was the size. They are extra long compared to my other toothbrushes. The bristles are extra soft and seem durable. I usually have to change my toothbrush every 30 days per my dentist recommendation. However, I might be able to go a little bit longer with these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Before using these toothbrushes my gums would bleed terribly after nearly every brushing. These have been a life saver. It would have been nice if I could have chosen the colors of the brushes that arrived, but that is only a minor annoyance.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes! I&#x27;ve bought them for years. I know, i sound like a commercial, but they really are different and clean better in my experience.  I have Fibromyalgia &amp; Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  I have very fussy gums with a propensity for sensitivity and infections.  I find these brushes clean the best without abrasion. I now spend less time in the dental chair for cleanings as a result - and i like that!</li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrushes, nothing fancy. The soft bristles feels amazing on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush you will ever use.  Tapered bristles make a huge difference, and I noticed the brush doesn&#x27;t get super hard after a few weeks like most brushes.  Maybe because it&#x27;s made of polyester and not nylon.</li>
            <li> Bristles are long which go into the space between teeth to clean out good&lt;br /&gt;and you get floss like clean feeling. Long handle helps as well.&lt;br /&gt;loved it so much bought it for the whole family.</li>
            <li> The best design I ever had and cleans like a champ!</li>
            <li> If you use an extra soft brush you must try this one.  It has extra long bristles that massage your gums and make your teeth feel cleaner than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH!!  I&#x27;ve been using these for over two years now. I decided to write a review to help anyone who is thinking about buying them, but is not sure if the bristles are soft enough.  My gums are very sensitive and I needed a toothbrush that would not leave me with irritated gums. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy them since at the time of my first purchase I had already bought almost all toothbrushes that I could get a hold off at the local stores to see if I could find on that was very soft and did a good job at cleaning my teeth.  I can say there are no over the counter brushes that are as soft, with as thin bristles and do a great job at cleaning teeth like this toothbrush.  If you&#x27;re on the fence and need a soft brush, try it.</li>
            <li> So far so good, it&#x27;s very soft which is just what I need being I have had several gum grafts. Will be reordering these.</li>
            <li> I have to use extra soft toothbrushes because I brush too hard.  Those are a pain to find in the stores, and I usually don&#x27;t have an extra half-hour to search among the hundreds of toothbrushes hanging there.  It finally dawned on me to check amazon; I found this toothbrush and read some of the reviews.  I am so glad I tried it!  This toothbrush feels AMAZING on my gums and it cleans my teeth well too.  It is much, much softer than the \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot;.  If you have sensitive gums or gum recession from excessively hard brushing, this toothbrush is worth a try.  My husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> I will never use another kind of toothbrush as long as I can get my hands on these.  The difference between these and a standard drugstore toothbrush is night and day.  I never knew that brushing my teeth could be painless, which isn&#x27;t something an adult should have to say.  I&#x27;ll be recommending them every chance I get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m undergoing head and neck radiotherapy and was looking for a soft toothbrush that wouldn&#x27;t irriate my sore gums caused by the treatment.  This toothbrush is surely soft, but the bristles are too sharp for my tender gums.  I had to stop using it.  If you&#x27;re gums aren&#x27;t sore, it would be a dandy toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for: a slight crook in the handle, a tapered head, and very soft bristles in a flat arrangement.  I hate the contoured brushes because it&#x27;s so difficult to brush thoroughly with them.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t harm my gume; helps me clean insides of cheeks and surface of tongue, etc. very soft. lies flat on counter top. (doesn&#x27;t roll over) and easy to handle for arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles (Brushing area).</li>
            <li> I have never heard of this brand before but I&#x27;m so happy I found it on Amazon! We don&#x27;t use soft toothbrushes in my house because I never thought they would work well. I saw this when browsing at Amazon.com and gave it a chance. There are a ton of soft bristles on this toothbrush. It doesn&#x27;t hurt your teeth and it does a great job cleaning. My kids love it too which says a lot. I recommend this product for everyone, kids and adults!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothbrush with soft bristles but they seemed stiff and were not as soft as I wanted.</li>
