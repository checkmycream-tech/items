            <li>It was used as the free samples in the rooms.</li>
            <li>The product is great, but only on my hair</li>
            <li>I stayed at a hotel in Vegas that had it in the bathrooms and bought my sister and I an 8.7 oz lotion in the Gift Shop because she said it was her favorite and now my new favorite</li>

            <li>It is made from blood oranges it smells so fresh and clean and really different.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy the scent left on my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a very light conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I was a little leary because of the price, but wow, we enjoy it and we don&#x27;t need to use as much as compared to other conditioners.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down but puts strenght and bounce in it.</li>
            <li> The plastic bottle came with a crack in the bottom of it - I just flipped it upside down and use it that way.</li>

            <li> Before the first time I got to use this lovely conditioner, the bottle fell and cracked in my shower! BOO</li>
            <li> This is a very light conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.  It leaves it soft and manageable and I love the fresh orange scent.</li>
            <li> I found this for the first time when in a LV hotel room when my husband was in the hospital.  Cali Tarocco - the shampoo and the conditioner - work really great on my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best conditioner.  Doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down but puts strenght and bounce in it.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a very nice hotel in Ft. Lauderdale.  All winter my hair has been full of static and flat.  I&#x27;ve tried several conditioners.  This one makes my hair feel silky. When I got back from Florida, I continued to use it and the static has practically disappeared.  Wish Amazon still had the 8.7 oz size.</li>
            <li> I ordered on bottle of Cali Tarocco Shampoo and on bottle of the Cali Conditioner and was sent two bottles of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Too expensive. I found similar products later for fraction of the price I paid. I thought I can not find similar products in the stores. Sorry I bought.</li>
            <li> We originally used this when a hotel provided it.  It is so fragrant and love the way it conditions. We liked it so much, we searched for it.  I was a little leary because of the price, but wow, we enjoy it and we don&#x27;t need to use as much as compared to other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I first used Tarrocco in an upscale hotel at the Jersey shore. It was used as the free samples in the rooms. I am very picky about scents and I loved it!! It is made from blood oranges it smells so fresh and clean and really different.</li>
            <li> Love this condition.  Especially when teamed with shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of the tarocco soaps/lotions ect.. how ever feel like Amazon has it over priced. I stayed at a hotel in Vegas that had it in the bathrooms and bought my sister and I an 8.7 oz lotion in the Gift Shop because she said it was her favorite and now my new favorite but they were $5 each. I could buy 3 of them for the price listed. I do however reccomend the product. It&#x27;s one of my favorite scents and my favorite item in my purse next to my phone..and money. :)</li>
            <li> I  used some of this product that I have had for FIVE years or more and it was just as good as NEW!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but my hair feels a little dry. Not sure if its the product. The plastic bottle came with a crack in the bottom of it - I just flipped it upside down and use it that way. Not worth it for me to return it. Probably won&#x27;t purchase this again</li>
            <li> I love the luxurious feel of the conditioner and the way it leaves my hair.  I thoroughly enjoy the scent left on my hair.</li>
            <li> Just like the shampoo this conditioner is watered down.  I have medium length hair and I had to use 1/4 of a bottle just to be able to run my fingers through my hair.  Very disappointed for the price that I paid.</li>
            <li> I also received it from a hotel. Notice the trend? It is hotel quality conditioner-meaning, it must smell good and feel good, and is also packaged well, so you think the $200 room is worth it. However, it is not salon quality. If it was, it would be sold in salons.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on time and I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> The bottle was not taped shut....and it leaked all over the package.  The product is great, but only on my hair</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful but really weighs my hair down and flattens it out when I try to style my hair</li>
            <li> Love the Tarocco products;  Body Wash, Shampoo and Conditioner!  Love it all!</li>
