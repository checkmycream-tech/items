            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was what we saw on The Today Show</li>
            <li>I was looking for a way to keep my vanity more organized.  </li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li>Now, I have this magical sticky thing that allows me to hang my tools from my makeup stand and have easy access to them instead of bending over to put it down/pick it up while dividing my hair and stuff.</li>
            <li>Nice and safe resting place for the hot curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to fit a straightener, curling wand, and two brushes with no problem.</li>
            <li>This is a great invention and it does a wonderful job at protecting my bathroom counter, however I only use the flat part b/c</li>
            <li>It arrived very quick and was packaged well.  </li>

            <li>I really liked this holster when I first got it.</li>
            <li>This silicon holster works really well to hold your hot styling tools very handy.</li>

            <li>Great product I got for my daughter to give to a friend as I had gotten us both one last year on qvc....</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Love this product, worth the money</li>
            <li>Basically this product works great if your using your flat iron within 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li>I love this hot iron holster.  </li>
            <li>I have to put one of my makeup drawer sets on top of it to make it stay, which defeats the purpose of the hot pad on the desk.  </li>
            <li>I even unplug hot iron &amp; put it in the holster, then store it in a drawer.....while it&#x27;s still hot!!!  </li>
            <li>but I took it off the counter to clean under it</li>
            <li>Love having a place for holster my hot curling iron instead of leaving it on the counter to cool.  </li>
            <li>Slips off sometimes but overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it on Amazon for a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and keep the hot iron out of the way.  </li>
            <li>Love this but wish the &amp;#34;flap&amp;#34; was clear or light colored.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this Hot Iron Holster because I don&#x27;t have to rest hot styling tools on damp hair towels anymore</li>
            <li>This product holds my hair straighter and my hair dryer, it is super practical, sticks super</li>
            <li>If they can find a way to make it stick to the counter better, I would love one, but this DID NOT LAST!</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better is if it were designed to better hold my hair dryer, too.</li>
            <li>Feel secure resting my hot Chi in this while styling my hair.</li>
            <li>Both stick very well to my countertop and easily hold each tool.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>It adheres to almost any surface and is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This sits right on my makeup table and has not budged once.</li>
            <li>It sticks to our granite tops like it was glued, but pulls right up effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>But I still like the storage ability and the fact I can put hot curling irons in it.</li>
            <li>This thing didn&#x27;t stick to my wooden vanity or my marble counter top.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says though it attracts dust.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take away any space for my makeup and is much nicer looking then throwing my curling iron on the floor!</li>
            <li>This is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I like the convenience &amp; safety of storing hot styling tools in the Holster once finished with them</li>
            <li>and/or the ability to pack a hot tool in a Holster when in a pinch.</li>
            <li>During that time the heat from the end had traveled up the silicone and made the handle really hot.</li>
            <li>My wife doesn&#x27;t have to rest her hot iron on the tub edge anymore.  </li>
            <li>It stuck well for the first week or so</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>and I am very comfortable putting my hot flat iron in the holster when I am done.  </li>
            <li>While holding a 1.5&amp;#34; large hot styling brush, the Holster still had room to spare.  </li>
            <li>Big enough to fit both a straightener and my hair dryer - a great way to keep my clutter to a minimum without clogging up my storage spaces with these tools that I use every single day.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and cleaned it then made sure it was completely dry</li>
            <li>Got this to protect my new, wooden counter top from the heat.  </li>
            <li>she really likes it as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It kept my curling iron off of the counter and worked very well; HOWEVER, after about two weeks the holster stopped adhering to the counter.</li>
            <li>I feel like what I really threw away was my money.</li>
            <li>This thing REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work all that well.  </li>
            <li>Shipped wicked fast and really stays put.</li>
            <li>This works really well for both my daughter and myself.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty obnoxious to have a black flap on top of the counter.  </li>
            <li>and I can heat it up while doing other things without it getting in the way or burning my counter top.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure I could have found a much nicer looking holster to nail down.</li>
            <li>I took it to Italy with me and came in so handy in the small bathrooms with no counter space.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It works well with my straightener rod that has high temperatures and it does not slip.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite little &amp;#34;things&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>I can put everything I use aside from hot irons such as a brush, comb, and hair spray.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put the hair spray and hot iron in holder at the same time!</li>
            <li>I ordered it initially from QVC for a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>I tried a few different things to try to get it to stick, but eventually ended up throwing it away after only two weeks of good use.</li>
            <li>It holds so much that would normally sit on a counter glasses, pens, pencils,wide enough for a memo pad, TV remotes etc.</li>
            <li>I have a small vanity and this is so handy to keep my brush or other small items handy</li>
            <li>I find that when I put my flat iron in the holster, it make the handle too hot to use.  </li>
            <li>I have to rinse it off frequently.</li>
            <li>You may have to move it out of the way of drawers in order to open them, but it sticks really well and doesnt budge unless you want it to.</li>

            <li> I followed the instructions and cleaned it then made sure it was completely dry</li>
            <li> Got this to protect my new, wooden counter top from the heat.  </li>
            <li> she really likes it as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It kept my curling iron off of the counter and worked very well; HOWEVER, after about two weeks the holster stopped adhering to the counter.</li>
            <li> I feel like what I really threw away was my money.</li>
            <li> This thing REALLY works.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work all that well.  </li>
            <li> Shipped wicked fast and really stays put.</li>
            <li> This works really well for both my daughter and myself.  </li>
            <li> Its pretty obnoxious to have a black flap on top of the counter.  </li>
            <li> and I can heat it up while doing other things without it getting in the way or burning my counter top.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure I could have found a much nicer looking holster to nail down.</li>
            <li> I took it to Italy with me and came in so handy in the small bathrooms with no counter space.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works well with my straightener rod that has high temperatures and it does not slip.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite little &amp;#34;things&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I can put everything I use aside from hot irons such as a brush, comb, and hair spray.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put the hair spray and hot iron in holder at the same time!</li>
            <li> I ordered it initially from QVC for a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few different things to try to get it to stick, but eventually ended up throwing it away after only two weeks of good use.</li>
            <li> It holds so much that would normally sit on a counter glasses, pens, pencils,wide enough for a memo pad, TV remotes etc.</li>
            <li> I have a small vanity and this is so handy to keep my brush or other small items handy</li>
            <li> I find that when I put my flat iron in the holster, it make the handle too hot to use.  </li>
            <li> I have to rinse it off frequently.</li>
            <li> You may have to move it out of the way of drawers in order to open them, but it sticks really well and doesnt budge unless you want it to.</li>
            <li> My counter is flat, not slanted into the sink like the picture shows, so I was a bit concerned when I ordered this that it would adhere well enough, but it does.  </li>
            <li> I did knock off one star because I had left my 1 inch flat iron on for about 45 minutes before I used it.</li>
            <li> and so I bought two of these, one for my hair dryer and one for my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> There is no issue with leaving my flat iron in the holder as it heats up</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I have a toddler who likes to pull on the cord of my flat iron.</li>
            <li> and I can put both my curling iron and flat iron in it.</li>
            <li> I put my flat iron and my blow dryer in it.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not really an issue.</li>
            <li> Finally a place for my curling iron, no more burning myself by having the iron fall off the counter.  </li>
            <li> Works extremely well - no slip.  </li>
            <li> I had to implement other iron holding devices.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I’m no longer afraid of cracking the sink or toilet tank cover by resting hot styling tools on them.  </li>
            <li> But we usually keep the counter bone dry.</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised on an airline in their airmall magazine, but amazon&#x27;s price was a bit less plus no shipping.  </li>
            <li> It would stick for a few seconds and then as soon as I tried to stick my straightener in it, down</li>
            <li> am I gonna burn the house down!</li>
            <li> what a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d def recommend purchasing one of these if you have little counter space or just want to declutter what space you have!</li>
            <li> I have very little bathroom counter space</li>
            <li> No more worrying:</li>
            <li> No more cluttered counter or tangled cords!</li>
            <li> No more tripping over wires or melting/damaging furniture!!!!!</li>
            <li> This sticks to my counter for about six hours and then randomly falls.</li>
            <li> This thing is useless, it stuck to NOTHING.</li>
            <li> To bad I had to give it a review because I would had rated 0 ...</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my sister and was so disappointed,, to bad she throw out the box because I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> Slides off my desk a lot :(  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for keeping things organized &amp; off the sink.  I bought another because it is so convenient.</li>
            <li> Works great. Hangs off the side of my solid-surface counter top and stays in place. This one holds my iron and I can heat it up while doing other things without it getting in the way or burning my counter top. Will definitely be ordering another one for my dryer. I think maybe if I had gotten the larger one, it would have held both.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.  It arrived very quick and was packaged well.  It works perfectly, holds well to the makeup table and can be moved around easily without leaving any marks.  Nice and safe resting place for the hot curling iron.  I&#x27;d recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my sister and was so disappointed,, to bad she throw out the box because I would have returned it. To bad I had to give it a review because I would had rated 0 ...what a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, just as advertised. I&#x27;m able to fit a straightener, curling wand, and two brushes with no problem. I&#x27;d def recommend purchasing one of these if you have little counter space or just want to declutter what space you have!</li>
            <li> It does not stick to every surface. It will not stick to my wooden topped drawer set. But I still like the storage ability and the fact I can put hot curling irons in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. stays wherever you put it. I use it for my heat gun when crafting, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being in the way.</li>
            <li> This thing didn&#x27;t stick to my wooden vanity or my marble counter top. I followed the instructions and cleaned it then made sure it was completely dry and it still didn&#x27;t work. It would stick for a few seconds and then as soon as I tried to stick my straightener in it, down it went. I ended up nailing it to my vanity so I could actually get some use out of it. But I&#x27;m sure I could have found a much nicer looking holster to nail down.</li>
            <li> Great idea. We use it to keep our hair dryer, rather than having to pull it out every AM. It will slip off, if water gets underneath it. But we usually keep the counter bone dry. So it&#x27;s not really an issue.</li>
            <li> This silicon holster works really well to hold your hot styling tools very handy. I don&#x27;t like lots of thing son the counter, but don;t like putting hot instruments underneath in the cabinet after use, so this is a great compromise. My counter is flat, not slanted into the sink like the picture shows, so I was a bit concerned when I ordered this that it would adhere well enough, but it does.  I saw this advertised on an airline in their airmall magazine, but amazon&#x27;s price was a bit less plus no shipping.  I gave my daughter one as a gift, too,a d she really likes it as well.</li>
            <li> Love this item. It does exactly what it says though it attracts dust. I have to rinse it off frequently.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> they reall do work and stick to any surface</li>
            <li> Love this! So simple yet so great! I am always looking for organizers that won&#x27;t take up my entire vanity or sink and will actually hold what I need in it. This sits right on my makeup table and has not budged once. Doesn&#x27;t take away any space for my makeup and is much nicer looking then throwing my curling iron on the floor!</li>
            <li> Feel secure resting my hot Chi in this while styling my hair. It grips a porcelain surface well but does not grip to a formica counter.  For me it is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I always leave my curlers and straighteners plugged in and they end up on the floor and kicked around. Now, I have this magical sticky thing that allows me to hang my tools from my makeup stand and have easy access to them instead of bending over to put it down/pick it up while dividing my hair and stuff. No more tripping over wires or melting/damaging furniture!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product gives you more counter space and keeps your hot things safe.</li>
            <li> This is exactly as advertised.  I have very little bathroom counter space and so I bought two of these, one for my hair dryer and one for my flat iron.  Both stick very well to my countertop and easily hold each tool.  There is no issue with leaving my flat iron in the holder as it heats up and I am very comfortable putting my hot flat iron in the holster when I am done.  Thanks for the great product!!</li>
            <li> my rating might be jaded a bit, but i thought this would stick to anything - well, it doesn&#x27;t stick to slate.</li>
            <li> I love it! It clings to my sink and anything that is porcelain, perfectly! I would recommend this to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> This is a great invention and it does a wonderful job at protecting my bathroom counter, however I only use the flat part b/c I find that when I put my flat iron in the holster, it make the handle too hot to use.  Overall, I still like it and it sticks with no problem!</li>
            <li> Love this but wish the &amp;#34;flap&amp;#34; was clear or light colored.  Its pretty obnoxious to have a black flap on top of the counter.  I cut mine off, attached double sided tape to the holster part and stuck it to the side of my cabinet. Perfect!!  I have a small vanity and this is so handy to keep my brush or other small items handy but out of the way.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.  It works on my tiny sink counter and I&#x27;ve also stuck it to itself around my towel rod.  Brilliant invention!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mother. She was balancing her curling iron off of a hanging towel rack.  She loves it and we will order another one for my aunt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this Hot Iron Holster because I don&#x27;t have to rest hot styling tools on damp hair towels anymore &amp; I’m no longer afraid of cracking the sink or toilet tank cover by resting hot styling tools on them.  This Holster stays in place &amp; can handle large/heavy styling tools.  While holding a 1.5&amp;#34; large hot styling brush, the Holster still had room to spare.  I like the convenience &amp; safety of storing hot styling tools in the Holster once finished with them and/or the ability to pack a hot tool in a Holster when in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Finally a place for my curling iron, no more burning myself by having the iron fall off the counter.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent and frees up space on my vanity - don&#x27;t have to worry about burning.  Just a wonderful product all around</li>
            <li> I needed something to hold my hair straighter in a safe, space efficient way. This product holds my hair straighter and my hair dryer, it is super practical, sticks super well, I&#x27;ve had it on my sink for about 3 months now, defiantly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I love my holster. It is great to have a place to put my curling iron and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Sure it was a great idea but it wont stay suctioned. I have a sink just like the one shown in picture an it sits on the floor beside the sink because every time I place my straightener in the dang thing falls there so I just leave it now. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and keep the hot iron out of the way.  Works extremely well - no slip.  Great for keeping the iron out the way while using and cooling.</li>
            <li> Holds amazingly well on just about any surface (porcelain, wood, laminate counter tops, etc).  Helps keep the sink and vanity uncluttered.</li>
            <li> I find the holster to be great when using my hot styling tools. Attaches to vanity easily. Easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> Must buy! Great product!</li>
            <li> This sticks to my counter for about six hours and then randomly falls. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I have a toddler who likes to pull on the cord of my flat iron. This product helps keep it out of the way in a nice \\&quot;pocket\\&quot;. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t seem to slip at all on my counter service. I did knock off one star because I had left my 1 inch flat iron on for about 45 minutes before I used it. During that time the heat from the end had traveled up the silicone and made the handle really hot. Basically this product works great if your using your flat iron within 5-10 minutes but I would not leave your tool on for any length of time.</li>
            <li> Slips off sometimes but overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this hot iron holster.  It stays put and I can put both my curling iron and flat iron in it.</li>
            <li> I got one of these as a gift over a year ago and I use it on a varnished wooden end table for holding a couple of remotes. It hangs between the table and couch arm, out of sight, and has never slipped or moved once. The person who bought it didn&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t use a curling iron, so I put it to another use. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Very nice and practical</li>
            <li> Everything it is advertised to be! One of my favorite little &amp;#34;things&amp;#34;! Works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to! No more worrying: am I gonna burn the house down!</li>
            <li> I really liked this holster when I first got it. It kept my curling iron off of the counter and worked very well; HOWEVER, after about two weeks the holster stopped adhering to the counter. I tried a few different things to try to get it to stick, but eventually ended up throwing it away after only two weeks of good use. I feel like what I really threw away was my money. If they can find a way to make it stick to the counter better, I would love one, but this DID NOT LAST!</li>
            <li> Love!  The only thing that would make it better is if it were designed to better hold my hair dryer, too.</li>
            <li> Perfect to store my straightener and curing iron on the side of my makeup vanity! Keeps everything neat and I have more room on my vanity.</li>
            <li> I got this to attach to the inside of my cabinet door. I attached it with thumb tacks. It actually stuck by itself on the vertical surface by itself for a while. It works great for putting my hot straightener in and not worry about burning anything.</li>
            <li> Love this! And it can hold two things at once.</li>
            <li> Brilliant!!  Work terrific!  My girls love it!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this but I took it off the counter to clean under it and now it will not stick at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was what we saw on The Today Show but it was and love it !</li>
            <li> All the women in my family now have these and love them, good quality, good delivery, worth the price. I would recommend to you to buy</li>
            <li> Great product I got for my daughter to give to a friend as I had gotten us both one last year on qvc....cheaper here.</li>
            <li> Love this product.! I saw it in a travel magazine and then found it on Amazon.  I took it to Italy with me and came in so handy in the small bathrooms with no counter space. I would recommend this to anyone who travels a lot.</li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t have to rest her hot iron on the tub edge anymore.  This thing REALLY works.  It sticks to our granite tops like it was glued, but pulls right up effortlessly.  Provided a nice resting place for her iron while heating and cooling off.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Got this to protect my new, wooden counter top from the heat.  It works wonderfully!!  I even unplug hot iron &amp; put it in the holster, then store it in a drawer.....while it&#x27;s still hot!!!  Love it!  Fairly priced.  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silicone so it attracts lint but overall it&#x27;s a great product. I can put everything I use aside from hot irons such as a brush, comb, and hair spray. Just don&#x27;t put the hair spray and hot iron in holder at the same time! Lol</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my needs! I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work all that well.  It doesn&#x27;t stay stuck on my sink... I had to implement other iron holding devices.  it really was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Shipped wicked fast and really stays put.</li>
            <li> Works great. Good space saver.</li>
            <li> Slides off my desk a lot :(  It stuck well for the first week or so but then it would constantly fall off.  I have to put one of my makeup drawer sets on top of it to make it stay, which defeats the purpose of the hot pad on the desk.  I&#x27;ve tried cleaning different ways and attaching to different surfaces, but it still slides off.  3 stars just because I am still using it.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely awesome!!!! No more cluttered counter or tangled cords!</li>
            <li> Big enough to fit both a straightener and my hair dryer - a great way to keep my clutter to a minimum without clogging up my storage spaces with these tools that I use every single day.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I was looking for a way to keep my vanity more organized.  Love having a place for holster my hot curling iron instead of leaving it on the counter to cool.  It sticks surprisingly well to the counter too.</li>
            <li> arrived on time in great condition and is as advertised.  It works well with my straightener rod that has high temperatures and it does not slip.</li>
            <li> love this product.  I ordered it initially from QVC for a much higher price.  So glad I found it on Amazon for a much lower price.  It holds so much that would normally sit on a counter glasses, pens, pencils,wide enough for a memo pad, TV remotes etc. It adheres to almost any surface and is well worth the money.  The one I bought at Amazon, is used in my bathroom to hold a straightening iron, brushes and a mirror.  Love this product, worth the money</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because I had to...if I could it would get none. This thing is useless, it stuck to NOTHING. Actually it did stick, you just couldn&#x27;t  put anything in it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this item!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do. I bought myself one and one for my daughter for Christmas. We both love it. I&#x27;m sure I will be buying more as gifts. It&#x27;s a great product. It&#x27;s amazing how it sticks to the counter without being sticky. I put my flat iron and my blow dryer in it.</li>
            <li> This works really well for both my daughter and myself.  You may have to move it out of the way of drawers in order to open them, but it sticks really well and doesnt budge unless you want it to.</li>
