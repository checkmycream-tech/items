            <li>I read the amazing reviews and decided to try it out..</li>
            <li>I trusted I would like it without sampling it because I just loved the original touch.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If you like Touch, you will love Touch with Love.</li>
            <li>and I just love it, when I saw Touch with Love being offerd</li>
            <li>I thought this perfume would smell much better because of the reviews</li>
            <li>buying another 2 bottles soon... :)</li>
            <li>Gave it to my friend who I purchase the  original TOUCH for and she loves it!</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance but fades very quickly on me</li>
            <li>My grandmother was in love with the original Touch and when she passed on my sister fell in love with it too -</li>
            <li>It has a old school smell that I find attractive.</li>
            <li>it dont smell cheap for price it wear off but it ok for what pay for it</li>
            <li>NOW I wanted something that would remind me but would suit me - that scent With Love is absolutely fantastic...</li>
            <li>i bought for bottle smooth smell</li>
            <li>Great purchase for christmast gift to your  relative.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this perfume, it smells so sweet and so sweet, the bottle is pink and cute!!</li>
            <li>I likeit but its a bit sweet.</li>
            <li>thanks :)</li>
            <li>It was a very hot summer, the hottest July on record in my area, so I should not have ordered perfume online.</li>
            <li>It is a soft elegant scent.</li>
            <li>I love the original touch, but this was totally different.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is dirt cheap, long lasting, smells great and is not widely worn, so I smell unique.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this fragrance to all the sundress Diva&#x27;s in the south who crave a clean soft scent that lingers, without being overpowering on your skin.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>the original Touch takes us back to being around our grandma...</li>
            <li>to me it just smells like its made for an older crowd.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The scent is powdery soft a little like the famous Baby Soft Perfume, it stays on for hours.</li>
            <li>I do not know what it normally smells like, so I may be blaming the weather/delivery unfairly, but I have tried Fred Hayman perfumes before and they have been OK.</li>

            <li> I have been wearing Touch for years so this time I thought I would try this version to be different. I trusted I would like it without sampling it because I just loved the original touch. It is a soft elegant scent. That is the best I can describe. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the original touch, but this was totally different. The verdict is still out on this one.</li>
