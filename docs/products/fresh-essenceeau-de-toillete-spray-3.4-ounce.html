            <li> Lovely fresh fragrance at a great price. I have recently paid twice as much for the exact same product Bloomingdales.</li>
            <li> I thought this was leftover stock since the scent was discontinued, but it isn&#x27;t David Yurman AT ALL. It smells nothing like it&#x27;s supposed to, and it burned my skin.</li>

            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this exact type in the department stores, however the same brand different fragrance was more expensive.  So not only was I please to find this here, but to get it cheaper was a plus.  The wife loves it so A+ in my books!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent. Fresh and bright. Smells amazing. Same as the one I bought at Nordstroms years back. Recommend.</li>
