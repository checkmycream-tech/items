            <li> This was totally beyond what I expected! I expected smaller, less bright...but it is bright and great size and very convenient with the suction cups to use or the pull out stand. I am a camper and sometimes the bathrooms have not enough light nor even a mirror. I have a tent trailer, which does not allow a lot of light for putting on makeup. Sometimes the campgrounds have no electric hookups, so this battery powered mirror is excellent! I love it!</li>
            <li> Great light. Happy with mirror size and suction stability so far.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I did many hours of research on this type of product before purchasing.  I have had many magnigying mirrors that have always fallen short.  This one is near perfect!  I use the suction cups so I can stand at the mirror to apply makeup.  The lights are bright. The horizontal shape is great as you can see a lot of your face.  It fits perfectly in the little protective pouch and worked great in my carry on suitcase. I am a budget shopper and considered this a splurge.  I do not regret it! This is a really worthwhile product.</li>
            <li> small and very portable, great magnification and suction cups work great.  light is nice and bright.</li>
            <li> I wish this mirror was a little bit bigger,  but other than that I love this mirror!</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT and had to buy another for my mom!!!!</li>
            <li> I am returning it as I wanted a double sided mirror</li>
            <li> Magnifies to see all your imperfections so be aware.  LOL!  I wish it were a bit larger in size but good for packing for trips.</li>
            <li> The size of the mirror is just right !&lt;br /&gt;Travels well. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great travel mirror and also very good for at home use.  The 10X magnification is just right.  I have tried 5X and 15X; the 5X isn&#x27;t powerful enough and the 15X is too much.  15X is great magnification but too much for normal makeup application.  The lighting is very bright.

            <li> smaller than expected.  lights didn&#x27;t work ever.  returned for full refund.  only sits at one angle when using kickstand.</li>
