            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>They are excellent.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go !  </li>
            <li>Colors are beautiful, and it&#x27;s like wearing a lip gloss that moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>This would make a great gift.</li>
            <li>Seller did a great job shipping them too.  </li>
            <li>These are particularly nice since they have a perfect amount of frost in them!  </li>
            <li>And the staying power of them seems great.  </li>
            <li>The orange is fairly bright and on trend for this summer.  </li>
            <li>They do have quite good staying power but do need to be reapplied during the day.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to eventually find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>stains the slips good</li>
            <li>So I searched the web for more and found them !</li>
            <li>Love them!  </li>
            <li>The staying power is amazing.</li>
            <li>Does everything a good lip product should do and to top it all off, is affordable.  </li>
            <li>Meets my expectations and was packaged quite nice.  </li>
            <li>they also have a nice pearl sheen to them.  </li>
            <li>Best lip stain lipstick so far!</li>
            <li>the price online was much better.</li>
            <li>Buy it!!  :-)</li>
            <li>These lipsticks turn to nice colors and go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have the matt Fran Wilson mood changing lipsticks and love them</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Glad to find these to replace my almost-used-up ones....</li>
            <li>I have used these mood lipsticks for years and love the way they leave color stained on your lips.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Been wearing it for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love these Lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>I love Fran Wilson Mood lipstick.</li>
            <li>It is long wearing and the color is great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other so-called long-lasting lipsticks, but Fran Wilson works best for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Fran Wilson lipstick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Fran Wilson lipstick.</li>
            <li>I have used these lipsticks before and still really enjoy them.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>The product was packaged well, quality great, and I will replace periodically so long as they are available.  </li>
            <li>, I love mine, I miss it so much when I am out-</li>
            <li>I love them, went back to order more and they ( QVC) had discontinued them.</li>
            <li>I really thought I would like the green color the best because it would be the brightest</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter which color she uses, they all turn a bright purplish pink on her and stain her lips.</li>
            <li>Pink is a nice pink that would look good on almost every skin and the brown is similar to a bright nude/pink.  </li>
            <li>Brings me back to the 80&#x27;s whwn they were popular.</li>
            <li>but pearlized is a fun alternative.</li>
            <li>great long lasting wear</li>
            <li>Each color is a bit different on my lips, but I love each of them.</li>
            <li>The color stays on pretty well after eating.  </li>
            <li>I love the regular mood catchers.  </li>
            <li>They can last a year or more.  </li>
            <li>but overall, I love them.  </li>
            <li>My only regret is that none is bright red.</li>
            <li>All the different colors look nice and natural...</li>
            <li>I love the colors and how long they stay on during the day, even when I am eating.</li>
            <li>I love these lipsticks and have used them for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I love these lipsticks and have used them for a long time.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old granddaughter thought they were cool so, keeping two as a lipstick primer, I gave the rest to her.</li>
            <li>The colors are NOT just the same old super bright fuchsia pink from the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The Fran Wilson MoodPearls show up as a lovely pink with a pearly glow.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again,</li>
            <li>Just really need to order ONE and stick with it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Orange, pink and brown are to my liking much more.  </li>
            <li>Each mood lipstick will change to different color from its original color when put on your lip.</li>
            <li>my favorites are Attitude and Envy (brown &amp; green)--colors look good on me and STAY on; only lipsticks I have found that actually stay on for several hours.</li>
            <li>They are just as good as the matt ones and give a little extra shine.</li>
            <li>I have been used them for a long time, it stays on very good, I only have to put on a few times a day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Interesting - a little like the mood rings of the 60s.</li>
            <li>Most, other lipstick only lasted until you eat or drink-</li>
            <li>The product was above my expectations, but it should be handled with more care as when i got it was half melt</li>
            <li>It is the only lip stick that I have used that really stays on until I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only lipstick that really STAYS on without smearing on cups, or glasses.  </li>
            <li>when I see my bare skin color when eat or drink  ! !</li>
            <li>These are disappointing considering how great the regular mood catchers by Fran Wilson are.</li>
            <li>And for less than $10, it is so worth the money.  </li>
            <li>They last a long time on your lips , I put them on lightly because if you put to much on it looks real dark.</li>
            <li>Of course, love the wild colors which really psyche my friends and family - who find it hard to believe the stick is green or blue, while the color on my lips is pink.</li>

            <li> This product is a long lasting lip stain, looks different color on everyone.</li>
            <li> They give lots of moisture and last long on the lips.</li>
            <li> They do last a long time.</li>
            <li> The color lasts and unlike other lipstains, does NOT dry your lips.  </li>
            <li> They are long wearing, and I do like all of the colors.</li>
            <li> They are creamy and stay on your lips a long time.  </li>
            <li> It lasts long without reapplying.  </li>
            <li> Whenever possible, I buy aloe based lipstick, which stays on my lips longer than other kinds do plus keeping my lips moist.  </li>
            <li> the colors are too similar to each other.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips like EVERY stain I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> The pearl ones however, seem to dry out my lips</li>
            <li> Even though there are six colors, they all really only show up as either pink or a maroonish pink.</li>
            <li> ALL THE COLORS ARE PINK</li>
            <li> The fuchsia Pink.</li>
            <li> Mostly pink, but some will change to red.&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li> Based on other review, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t turn any other color.</li>
            <li> The colors are subtle and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Not for little kids, though, as they will end up with pink, peach, and fuchsia stripes all over their face and body.</li>
            <li> Each one turns a slightly different pink on the lips - from shocking pink down to a light purple pink.  </li>
            <li> For example the green comes out pink even though the color of the stick is green.</li>
            <li> The shop closed and I was unable to find it in other local stores.  </li>
            <li> When you buy it, you think it is expensive, but there are a lot of lipsticks and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased these lip stains a few years ago an  </li>
            <li> crazy about the regular colors</li>
            <li> They all have a subtle change of color on me.  </li>
            <li> It provides a semi-permanent color base so that when you regular lipstick wears off you still have color on your lips.</li>
            <li> It is a very subtle pink/nude color.  </li>
            <li> I never buy expensive lipstick anymore</li>
            <li> but.. they are all red/pink when you put them on.. so sad</li>

            <li> I use this in conjunction with the Wood Matcher Lipsticks.  The product was packaged well, quality great, and I will replace periodically so long as they are available.  I had been searching local stores and having difficulty except at holidays to find this product and the price online was much better.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. Colors are beautiful, and it&#x27;s like wearing a lip gloss that moisturizes.  Buy it!!  :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great selection of colors! I have been wearing mood lipstick for 30 years. It provides a semi-permanent color base so that when you regular lipstick wears off you still have color on your lips. Not for little kids, though, as they will end up with pink, peach, and fuchsia stripes all over their face and body.</li>
            <li> Interesting - a little like the mood rings of the 60s. Each one turns a slightly different pink on the lips - from shocking pink down to a light purple pink.  My 16 year old granddaughter thought they were cool so, keeping two as a lipstick primer, I gave the rest to her. They do have quite good staying power but do need to be reapplied during the day.</li>
            <li> ALL THE COLORS ARE PINK BUT THEY DO STAY ON .... I THOUGHT they all would be different colors??????? Why not some browns???</li>
            <li> I have used these lipsticks before and still really enjoy them. The colors are subtle and long lasting.</li>
            <li> great long lasting wear</li>
            <li> These lipsticks turn to nice colors and go on so smoothly. They give lots of moisture and last long on the lips.</li>
            <li> I have the matt Fran Wilson mood changing lipsticks and love them so when I saw these I had to add them to the collection. They are just as good as the matt ones and give a little extra shine. Like all Fran Wilson of this type they stay on for hours.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Fran Wilson lipstick at a cosmetic shop in a nearby outlet mall.  The shop closed and I was unable to find it in other local stores.  I was delighted to eventually find it on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve tried other so-called long-lasting lipsticks, but Fran Wilson works best for me.  I especially like the moist and creamy nature of this lipstick.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Based on other review, I decided to try it.  What a wonderful product!  The color lasts and unlike other lipstains, does NOT dry your lips.  The Fran Wilson MoodPearls show up as a lovely pink with a pearly glow.  Does everything a good lip product should do and to top it all off, is affordable.  Of course, love the wild colors which really psyche my friends and family - who find it hard to believe the stick is green or blue, while the color on my lips is pink.</li>
            <li> I like Fran Wilson lipsticks.  They are long wearing, and I do like all of the colors. I&#x27;ve tried all of her lipsticks, and I have been wearing them for 12 years.  They are excellent.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and how long they stay on during the day, even when I am eating. Each color is a bit different on my lips, but I love each of them. I would recommend this set to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love these. Brings me back to the 80&#x27;s whwn they were popular.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Fran Wilson lipstick. The staying power is amazing. I never buy expensive lipstick anymore , this is \\&quot;stainier\\&quot; &amp; moister. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips like EVERY stain I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;More crazy about the regular colors but pearlized is a fun alternative.</li>
            <li> I love these lipsticks and have used them for a long time.  The color stays on pretty well after eating.  My favorites are the blue and purple.</li>
            <li> I read about this in the WALL STREET JOURNAL! Fabulous product. Highly recommend. This would make a great gift. Lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased these lip stains a few years ago an  I love them, went back to order more and they ( QVC) had discontinued them. So I searched the web for more and found them ! YEA !!!!  They last a long time on your lips , I put them on lightly because if you put to much on it looks real dark. Then I use a shimmer color gloss and I&#x27;m good to go !  Seller did a great job shipping them too.  Thanks again,</li>
            <li> So far... every color I&#x27;ve tried has turned PINK on me. The fuchsia Pink. So I have to wonder.... is it ME and MY chemical makeup or does the product just NOT do what it CLAIMS to do?</li>
            <li> I love these lipsticks and have used them for a long time. What a wonderful product! I&#x27;m a huge fan of Fran Wilson lipstick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter which color she uses, they all turn a bright purplish pink on her and stain her lips.</li>
            <li> Glad to find these to replace my almost-used-up ones....my favorites are Attitude and Envy (brown &amp; green)--colors look good on me and STAY on; only lipsticks I have found that actually stay on for several hours.</li>
            <li> The product was above my expectations, but it should be handled with more care as when i got it was half melt</li>
            <li> I love the regular mood catchers.  They are creamy and stay on your lips a long time.  The pearl ones however, seem to dry out my lips and I don&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;pearlized&#x27;&amp;#34; effect.  These are disappointing considering how great the regular mood catchers by Fran Wilson are.</li>
            <li> I have used these mood lipsticks for years and love the way they leave color stained on your lips.  These are particularly nice since they have a perfect amount of frost in them!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Whenever possible, I buy aloe based lipstick, which stays on my lips longer than other kinds do plus keeping my lips moist.  These lipsticks are all winners.  My only regret is that none is bright red.</li>
            <li> All colors was the same on me didnt like that</li>
            <li> the colors are too similar to each other. Just really need to order ONE and stick with it.</li>
            <li> just whst i was looking for. great product!</li>
            <li> When you buy it, you think it is expensive, but there are a lot of lipsticks and they last a long time. They can last a year or more.  It is the only lip stick that I have used that really stays on until I wash my face.  I have been using it for more than 15 years.  I love it.</li>
            <li> there all the same color RED! they don&#x27;t turn any other color. stains the slips good but i don&#x27;t want to wear red all the time!</li>
            <li> - One customer comment that it is no color or totally different color, that is not correct........That is why it is called Mood lipstick, it changes by your mood, also it is different with its color when on different people by the chemistry from the skin. Each mood lipstick will change to different color from its original color when put on your lip. Mostly pink, but some will change to red.&lt;br /&gt;-  I have been used them for a long time, it stays on very good, I only have to put on a few times a day.  Most, other lipstick only lasted until you eat or drink- then gone........&lt;br /&gt;-  Hope this will help you to decide, I love mine, I miss it so much when I am out-when I see my bare skin color when eat or drink  ! !</li>
            <li> This product is a long lasting lip stain, looks different color on everyone. Been wearing it for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years!  It&#x27;s the only lipstick that really STAYS on without smearing on cups, or glasses.  It lasts long without reapplying.  Meets my expectations and was packaged quite nice.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Even though there are six colors, they all really only show up as either pink or a maroonish pink.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be different color sticks.. but.. they are all red/pink when you put them on.. so sad</li>
            <li> Only the pinkish colors worked for me in the pearl lipsticks. They do last a long time. Next time, I will buy the regular (not pearlized) lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON VERIFIED</li>
            <li> I love these Lipsticks.  It is long wearing and the color is great!</li>
            <li> Either there&#x27;s no color or it&#x27;s completely different from the color of the stick. For example the green comes out pink even though the color of the stick is green.</li>
            <li> I love Fran Wilson Mood lipstick. I have worn it for years and this purchase was just what  said it was!</li>
            <li> I like how it stains my lips so that even when it wears off there is still some color...All the different colors look nice and natural...no matter what mood I&#x27;m in!!  I&#x27;m still looking for something that lasts for hours without getting my lips permanently tattooed!!  Oh well...</li>
            <li> I just bought these.  They are excellent. The colors are NOT just the same old super bright fuchsia pink from the 80&#x27;s.  They all have a subtle change of color on me.  Keep in mind that your body pH will determine the color but overall, I love them.  I really thought I would like the green color the best because it would be the brightest but it isn&#x27;t.  It is a very subtle pink/nude color.  Orange, pink and brown are to my liking much more.  The orange is fairly bright and on trend for this summer.  Pink is a nice pink that would look good on almost every skin and the brown is similar to a bright nude/pink.  Love them!  And for less than $10, it is so worth the money.  Oh yes, almost forgot...they also have a nice pearl sheen to them.  I wish they had the ability to add photos because I have one that shows the color of each on my inner arm.  And the staying power of them seems great.  I haven&#x27;t tested the wear out but it took makeup remover for it to come off my arm!  Best lip stain lipstick so far!</li>
