            <li>Amazon is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Diamon Deb nail files were just about as close as you could get to a perfect product: well designed, a great price, easy to find, and a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a good portion of my life, glad to have found them on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>I work with my hands all day and this file is perfect for keeping my nails manageable , clean and beautiful.</li>
            <li>What a wonderful surprise to fine them again on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, these are not as good as the originals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Diamon Deb nail files for years when I could find them and I loved them.</li>
            <li>Best nail file available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one like this for 40 years and have always loved it.  </li>
            <li>However, not quite as good as they used to be (because they are now made in China?).</li>
            <li>and I loved it; after a couple of moves I lost it and couldn&#x27;t find anymore..  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the files hold up like they did years ago, but nothing else I have tried is as good.</li>
            <li>Best Nail file used lost and had to get replacement had first one for over 25 years!</li>
            <li>Mine did, and for finding on the fly a Diamon Deb file, my love forever remains my love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just like my grandma, it will be my very favorite file.</li>
            <li>I have had one of these files for more than 30 years and it still does a great job</li>
            <li>The customer service is beyond excellent, I didn&#x27;t receive the first one I ordered &amp; they sent me another one w/o question or making any fuss.  </li>
            <li>Better than the file I had!</li>
            <li>I had a nail file like this already which I really liked --</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find a source for these too, but when I received them, they were stamped \\&quot;China\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>They are still superior to anything else on the market that I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>Diamon Deb nail file does a nice job filing your nails.  </li>
            <li>this one is very abrasive and perfect!</li>
            <li>Maybe it has an industrial or handy person use</li>
            <li>The new one works great!</li>
            <li>I think this is the best file I have ever used particularly because of the very unique pointed tip.</li>
            <li>Since I  had one that I have used some 20 years, I was delighted to see that they are still available.  </li>
            <li>This by far, in my opinion, is the best fingernail file ever made.  </li>
            <li>The grit is very fine and does not cause the nail to split or peel while filing.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting and working out great.</li>
            <li>They are very fantastic to work with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The ordering and receiving of this item went very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Apologies and words of love should not rely on a nail file.</li>
            <li>I am glad I decided to try to find it on the internet.</li>
            <li>It works better than any others on the market that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Wish this file were a bit wider--otherwise love it.</li>
            <li>I love these nail files.</li>
            <li>I have used these for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>so glad it happened.</li>
            <li>Love these nail files</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these files.</li>
            <li>These are simply the best.</li>
            <li>IMHO this is the best for the money last 20 times longer than those paper ones</li>
            <li>I was in the beauty business for most of my life.</li>
            <li>family 50+ more years.</li>
            <li>I have used these files for many years.  </li>
            <li>But, I have not been able to find it.  </li>
            <li>Many reviews here seem to use the names interchangably.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Diamon Deb files exclusively for many years.  </li>
            <li>this is okay for calluses though</li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased that this is now available on line.</li>
            <li>you always be on the ready to write your loved one by retaining a Diamon Deb file in your briefcase or bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores in my area and am so excited to find it is still being made.  </li>
            <li>It was still good after 20 years and couldn&#x27;t live without one!</li>
            <li>tad more flexible now, but still that great product that will last for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one I received after making this purchase has a more rounded tip, which doesn&#x27;t seem to clean under the nails as well.  </li>
            <li>When I was a teenager this was an easy to find item.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong -</li>
            <li>But if you do your nails a lot or are going to carry this in a purse you should be fine.</li>
            <li>An excellent investment for anyone looking for a good long lasting file.</li>
            <li>Your nails will be perfectly shaped, and smooth, without the little pieces of nail that snag everything from filing with another file.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of these files.  </li>
            <li>It files smoothly yet without a lot of pressure.</li>
            <li>They provide a smooth shaping of the nail and do not nick or damage it.</li>
            <li>These files are not as readily available as they once were.  </li>
            <li>this file replaced one that I have used for several years and is great.</li>
            <li>I smooth them afterward with superfine sandpaper and</li>
            <li>just not as smooth of a stroke over the nail . . .  </li>
            <li>This is a great nail file and it seems to last forever!</li>
            <li>Smooth filing.</li>
            <li>but it was cheap...</li>
            <li>An older woman with perfect nails heard my heart and my tale, and delivered romantic salvation with the Diamion Deb file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The original DiamonDeb files were fantastic.</li>
            <li>Experimentation with nail shape to produce the most consistent tone is a never ending process ...</li>
            <li>: Please do not dumb down this product one more time!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are the best finger nail files you can get and the Chinese knockoffs do not last.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get one just like it for my daughter, so on a whim typed the product name into my browser, and lo and behold, found it for sale on Amazon at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>As a professional pianist and keyboard player, my nails have to be at the perfect length all the time, and must also not be brittle as sometimes happens with other files or clippers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the 6 inch version for many years and decided it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>Quite powerful - does a quick job.</li>
            <li>sense sending it back because the postage would cost more than the item itself!</li>
            <li>I ordered 15 of these files last year, and may send for more!</li>
            <li>The old ones are stamped \\&quot;USA\\&quot; The originals have a sharper point, a feature which I personally make great use of.</li>
            <li>okay, but not like my old ones</li>
            <li>The filing portion works great in shaping the nail and removing those small cracks and tears, but what I particularly liked about this file is the pointed tip at the opposite end.</li>
            <li>; he ALMOST got it right,</li>
            <li>This size is just right for carrying in a purse.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It make shaping very fast.</li>
            <li>They file very smoothly and don&#x27;t leave any jagged edges like the cross cut metal files would leave.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.,</li>
            <li>Does the job, very sturdy compared to the flimsy nail files I was used to!</li>
            <li>The last two I had lasted more than 50 years.</li>
            <li>I first learned about diamond deb from my guitar teacher in college and have been using them ever since.</li>
            <li>The Diamon Deb Nail File is exactly the product that I had been looking for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several Diamondeb nail files over the years, but they had what I feel was a better &amp;#34;point&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>These last longer than most and it like the pointed end for cleaning my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>I just filed my nails using a Diamon Deb  (8&amp;#34;) that I have used since 1959.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Classical Guitarists spend a lot of time with nail care, in particular the right hand combination of fingertip and nail are responsible for producing the warm, vibrant tones of the instrument.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to finally locate this product after years of limping along with my old \\&quot;Diamon Deb\\&quot; file.  </li>
            <li>I am very particular about the quality of nail files and you just cannot beat Diamon Deb files.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always love them because they were the ONLY file that had a pointy tip that went under the tip of my nails, that I could use not only to file my nails well, but also to clean them.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention to the size and purchased the 8&amp;#34</li>
            <li>it gently files them.  </li>
            <li>The surfaces were much rougher than my made-in-the-USA Diamon Deb nail files, and there didn&#x27;t seem to be a finer side to it at all.</li>
            <li>They seem much cheaper than they used to be.  </li>
            <li>I just searched for it on Amazon - and there it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and my nails are much happier when I file them.</li>
            <li>Much better than an emery board or rough metal file.</li>
            <li>My nails split and many files are just too rough.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I would love it if you went back to your old specs, whatever</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s useless for the fine, smooth filing of the original.</li>
            <li>I really like my new nail file.  </li>
            <li>This is the type of file we used when I was a child, only better, and there&#x27;s no comparison for simply filing your nails.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Diamon Deb</li>
            <li>I have used Diamon Deb nail files since I was in high school, it seems.  </li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t finely ground, the rough material catches and tears the edges of my nails.</li>
            <li>The current files made under that name look the same, but don&#x27;t last more than a couple of years of single-user use.&lt;br /&gt;Better than an emery board, but not by much.</li>
            <li>The new Diamon Debs seem to work just as well as the ones made over the years.</li>
            <li>The new one, and the one I bought after that, just don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the new tip design doesn&#x27;t get under the nail well.</li>
            <li>but it did seem smoother than the new file I just received.  </li>
            <li>Thought I wish they would make a slightly nicer case for it, They are easy to lose in those flimsy plastic holders they come in.</li>
            <li>The Chinese version has a rounded point which is far less effective for cleaning under the nails.</li>
            <li>They are so much better than an ordinary emory board.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Much better than your usual emory board.  </li>
            <li>It is barely hanging on as &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Much better than the glass ones and the new emery ones mounted on foam board, both types of which are too thick to even use well in the space between the nail and the finger.</li>
            <li>They are hard to find and they are my favorite.</li>
            <li>my trusty old Diamond Deb.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could find an old one on sale.</li>
            <li>I travel frequently and like to carry it in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I whipped out this 40 some year old file</li>
            <li>This file is not the quality of the old one I had.</li>
            <li>I used an old one and reshaped the end works well now.</li>
            <li>I still have two of the old ones, but they have lost some of their filing strength.</li>
            <li>I looked for many years for a Diamon Deb file to replace one I&#x27;d lost which I purchased in the late 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>no longer pointed lfike the old ones</li>
            <li>--I prefer the old style</li>
            <li>They used to make these in the USA, because I have an old one that says so; Three stars for being made in China.</li>
            <li>I have two I have used for at least 25 years and had not been able to find them anywhere in stores.  </li>
            <li>change naturally over time.</li>
            <li>it is considerably sharper</li>
            <li>This one replaced an old one that I&#x27;ve had for probably 15 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these files, which come in different lengths, for years, and they really do stand up.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the manufacturor of the old diamond nail file I had years ago</li>
            <li>I love my Diamon Deb nail files that were made in the USA a few years back.</li>
            <li>Not like the diamond 20 years ago… This is super Ruff, so not useful finishing the nail...</li>
            <li>Wish I had payed more attention to sizes as the 8 inch is a little long for me.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of gardening and don&#x27;t like to wear gloves, all other files I have tried that have a rounded point or are hooked, just don&#x27;t seem to clean everything under and around the nail, especially as my nails are rather curved.</li>
            <li>We Americans have been growing accustomed to cheaper products in every respect, made with less care and less love.  </li>
            <li>I nearly keep it under lock and key!  </li>
            <li>My purchase was shipped promptly and I can finally discard the old one.</li>
            <li>Files cleaner than emery boards and much easier to use than the fat wide ones that are suppose to be &amp;#34;so chicy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>They have been getting more and more difficult to find lately.  </li>
            <li>Barely.  </li>
            <li>This one is just a little bit too big in my opinion, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a good and functional product.</li>
            <li>Well worth spending a few bucks on vs the disposable type files.</li>
            <li>It seemed to tear my nails more than file them (I have thin nails).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this over any emery board or any other type nail file.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on higher priced brands or low end ones.  </li>
            <li>The file works fine on our tough toe nails too as well as on our finger nails.</li>
            <li>in a desperate strait so many years ago, when the time to write to her something of bliss and beauty, my pencil tip broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting in a New York park, I asked around.</li>
            <li>The new ones are rough, coarse, and of no use to me.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had one like this for 40 years and have always loved it.  </li>
            <li> However, not quite as good as they used to be (because they are now made in China?).</li>
            <li> and I loved it; after a couple of moves I lost it and couldn&#x27;t find anymore..  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the files hold up like they did years ago, but nothing else I have tried is as good.</li>
            <li> Best Nail file used lost and had to get replacement had first one for over 25 years!</li>
            <li> Mine did, and for finding on the fly a Diamon Deb file, my love forever remains my love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just like my grandma, it will be my very favorite file.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these files for more than 30 years and it still does a great job</li>
            <li> The customer service is beyond excellent, I didn&#x27;t receive the first one I ordered &amp; they sent me another one w/o question or making any fuss.  </li>
            <li> Better than the file I had!</li>
            <li> I had a nail file like this already which I really liked --</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find a source for these too, but when I received them, they were stamped \\&quot;China\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> They are still superior to anything else on the market that I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> Diamon Deb nail file does a nice job filing your nails.  </li>
            <li> this one is very abrasive and perfect!</li>
            <li> Maybe it has an industrial or handy person use</li>
            <li> The new one works great!</li>
            <li> I think this is the best file I have ever used particularly because of the very unique pointed tip.</li>
            <li> Since I  had one that I have used some 20 years, I was delighted to see that they are still available.  </li>
            <li> This by far, in my opinion, is the best fingernail file ever made.  </li>
            <li> The grit is very fine and does not cause the nail to split or peel while filing.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting and working out great.</li>
            <li> They are very fantastic to work with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The ordering and receiving of this item went very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Apologies and words of love should not rely on a nail file.</li>
            <li> I am glad I decided to try to find it on the internet.</li>
            <li> It works better than any others on the market that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Wish this file were a bit wider--otherwise love it.</li>
            <li> I love these nail files.</li>
            <li> I have used these for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> so glad it happened.</li>
            <li> Love these nail files</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these files.</li>
            <li> These are simply the best.</li>
            <li> IMHO this is the best for the money last 20 times longer than those paper ones</li>
            <li> I was in the beauty business for most of my life.</li>
            <li> family 50+ more years.</li>
            <li> I have used these files for many years.  </li>
            <li> But, I have not been able to find it.  </li>
            <li> Many reviews here seem to use the names interchangably.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Diamon Deb files exclusively for many years.  </li>
            <li> this is okay for calluses though</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased that this is now available on line.</li>
            <li> you always be on the ready to write your loved one by retaining a Diamon Deb file in your briefcase or bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores in my area and am so excited to find it is still being made.  </li>
            <li> It was still good after 20 years and couldn&#x27;t live without one!</li>
            <li> tad more flexible now, but still that great product that will last for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one I received after making this purchase has a more rounded tip, which doesn&#x27;t seem to clean under the nails as well.  </li>
            <li> When I was a teenager this was an easy to find item.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong -</li>
            <li> But if you do your nails a lot or are going to carry this in a purse you should be fine.</li>
            <li> An excellent investment for anyone looking for a good long lasting file.</li>
            <li> Your nails will be perfectly shaped, and smooth, without the little pieces of nail that snag everything from filing with another file.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of these files.  </li>
            <li> It files smoothly yet without a lot of pressure.</li>
            <li> They provide a smooth shaping of the nail and do not nick or damage it.</li>
            <li> These files are not as readily available as they once were.  </li>
            <li> this file replaced one that I have used for several years and is great.</li>
            <li> I smooth them afterward with superfine sandpaper and</li>
            <li> just not as smooth of a stroke over the nail . . .  </li>
            <li> This is a great nail file and it seems to last forever!</li>
            <li> Smooth filing.</li>
            <li> but it was cheap...</li>
            <li> An older woman with perfect nails heard my heart and my tale, and delivered romantic salvation with the Diamion Deb file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original DiamonDeb files were fantastic.</li>
            <li> Experimentation with nail shape to produce the most consistent tone is a never ending process ...</li>
            <li> : Please do not dumb down this product one more time!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the best finger nail files you can get and the Chinese knockoffs do not last.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get one just like it for my daughter, so on a whim typed the product name into my browser, and lo and behold, found it for sale on Amazon at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> As a professional pianist and keyboard player, my nails have to be at the perfect length all the time, and must also not be brittle as sometimes happens with other files or clippers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the 6 inch version for many years and decided it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> Quite powerful - does a quick job.</li>
            <li> sense sending it back because the postage would cost more than the item itself!</li>
            <li> I ordered 15 of these files last year, and may send for more!</li>
            <li> The old ones are stamped \\&quot;USA\\&quot; The originals have a sharper point, a feature which I personally make great use of.</li>
            <li> okay, but not like my old ones</li>
            <li> The filing portion works great in shaping the nail and removing those small cracks and tears, but what I particularly liked about this file is the pointed tip at the opposite end.</li>
            <li> ; he ALMOST got it right,</li>
            <li> This size is just right for carrying in a purse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It make shaping very fast.</li>
            <li> They file very smoothly and don&#x27;t leave any jagged edges like the cross cut metal files would leave.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.,</li>
            <li> Does the job, very sturdy compared to the flimsy nail files I was used to!</li>
            <li> The last two I had lasted more than 50 years.</li>
            <li> I first learned about diamond deb from my guitar teacher in college and have been using them ever since.</li>
            <li> The Diamon Deb Nail File is exactly the product that I had been looking for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Diamondeb nail files over the years, but they had what I feel was a better &amp;#34;point&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> These last longer than most and it like the pointed end for cleaning my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I just filed my nails using a Diamon Deb  (8&amp;#34;) that I have used since 1959.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Classical Guitarists spend a lot of time with nail care, in particular the right hand combination of fingertip and nail are responsible for producing the warm, vibrant tones of the instrument.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to finally locate this product after years of limping along with my old \\&quot;Diamon Deb\\&quot; file.  </li>
            <li> I am very particular about the quality of nail files and you just cannot beat Diamon Deb files.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always love them because they were the ONLY file that had a pointy tip that went under the tip of my nails, that I could use not only to file my nails well, but also to clean them.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention to the size and purchased the 8&amp;#34</li>
            <li> it gently files them.  </li>
            <li> The surfaces were much rougher than my made-in-the-USA Diamon Deb nail files, and there didn&#x27;t seem to be a finer side to it at all.</li>
            <li> They seem much cheaper than they used to be.  </li>
            <li> I just searched for it on Amazon - and there it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and my nails are much happier when I file them.</li>
            <li> Much better than an emery board or rough metal file.</li>
            <li> My nails split and many files are just too rough.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I would love it if you went back to your old specs, whatever</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s useless for the fine, smooth filing of the original.</li>
            <li> I really like my new nail file.  </li>
            <li> This is the type of file we used when I was a child, only better, and there&#x27;s no comparison for simply filing your nails.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Diamon Deb</li>
            <li> I have used Diamon Deb nail files since I was in high school, it seems.  </li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t finely ground, the rough material catches and tears the edges of my nails.</li>
            <li> The current files made under that name look the same, but don&#x27;t last more than a couple of years of single-user use.&lt;br /&gt;Better than an emery board, but not by much.</li>
            <li> The new Diamon Debs seem to work just as well as the ones made over the years.</li>
            <li> The new one, and the one I bought after that, just don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the new tip design doesn&#x27;t get under the nail well.</li>
            <li> but it did seem smoother than the new file I just received.  </li>
            <li> Thought I wish they would make a slightly nicer case for it, They are easy to lose in those flimsy plastic holders they come in.</li>
            <li> The Chinese version has a rounded point which is far less effective for cleaning under the nails.</li>
            <li> They are so much better than an ordinary emory board.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Much better than your usual emory board.  </li>
            <li> It is barely hanging on as &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Much better than the glass ones and the new emery ones mounted on foam board, both types of which are too thick to even use well in the space between the nail and the finger.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find and they are my favorite.</li>
            <li> my trusty old Diamond Deb.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could find an old one on sale.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and like to carry it in my purse.  </li>
            <li> I whipped out this 40 some year old file</li>
            <li> This file is not the quality of the old one I had.</li>
            <li> I used an old one and reshaped the end works well now.</li>
            <li> I still have two of the old ones, but they have lost some of their filing strength.</li>
            <li> I looked for many years for a Diamon Deb file to replace one I&#x27;d lost which I purchased in the late 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> no longer pointed lfike the old ones</li>
            <li> --I prefer the old style</li>
            <li> They used to make these in the USA, because I have an old one that says so; Three stars for being made in China.</li>
            <li> I have two I have used for at least 25 years and had not been able to find them anywhere in stores.  </li>
            <li> change naturally over time.</li>
            <li> it is considerably sharper</li>
            <li> This one replaced an old one that I&#x27;ve had for probably 15 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these files, which come in different lengths, for years, and they really do stand up.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the manufacturor of the old diamond nail file I had years ago</li>
            <li> I love my Diamon Deb nail files that were made in the USA a few years back.</li>
            <li> Not like the diamond 20 years ago… This is super Ruff, so not useful finishing the nail...</li>
            <li> Wish I had payed more attention to sizes as the 8 inch is a little long for me.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of gardening and don&#x27;t like to wear gloves, all other files I have tried that have a rounded point or are hooked, just don&#x27;t seem to clean everything under and around the nail, especially as my nails are rather curved.</li>
            <li> We Americans have been growing accustomed to cheaper products in every respect, made with less care and less love.  </li>
            <li> I nearly keep it under lock and key!  </li>
            <li> My purchase was shipped promptly and I can finally discard the old one.</li>
            <li> Files cleaner than emery boards and much easier to use than the fat wide ones that are suppose to be &amp;#34;so chicy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> They have been getting more and more difficult to find lately.  </li>
            <li> Barely.  </li>
            <li> This one is just a little bit too big in my opinion, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a good and functional product.</li>
            <li> Well worth spending a few bucks on vs the disposable type files.</li>
            <li> It seemed to tear my nails more than file them (I have thin nails).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this over any emery board or any other type nail file.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on higher priced brands or low end ones.  </li>
            <li> The file works fine on our tough toe nails too as well as on our finger nails.</li>
            <li> in a desperate strait so many years ago, when the time to write to her something of bliss and beauty, my pencil tip broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting in a New York park, I asked around.</li>
            <li> The new ones are rough, coarse, and of no use to me.</li>
            <li> This file is a plain piece of stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, America, another great product has fallen due to manufacture overseas.</li>
            <li> I took the file back to the store and struggled for a couple of years with emory boards, other brands of files, etc when I unexpectedly found</li>
            <li> After the large chain stores sidelined the local guy, no more Diamon Deb.  </li>
            <li> It is very rough, but the one it is replacing was 45 years old, so I&#x27;m in the adjusting to \\&quot;new\\&quot; phase.  </li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> And they last a very long time!</li>
            <li> I recently got a new one and was surprised at how poor it was.</li>
            <li> This is the standard for classical guitarists and any other pickers that use their nails.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for about 50 years, and it is getting a little old.</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble to return the whole order</li>
            <li> The quality now is not near what it used to be when they were made in the USA. :</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably too long to just carry around with you</li>
            <li> long but 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Too rough for human nails..</li>
            <li> A long time (I am 66).  </li>
            <li> It is fairly long.  </li>
            <li> I lost my 1970&#x27;s vintage Diamond Deb nail file in the mid 90&#x27;s (at least I thought I had) and found a new Diamond Deb file at a discount hair care chain store.  </li>
            <li> In short, don&#x27;t buy one of the new ones, because it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> Down to a simple, old-standard style nail file.  </li>
            <li> A little lead would be enough.</li>
            <li> My old one was getting a bit dull and I could not find one in a store.</li>
            <li> A;though a little long, this will probably be the last nail file I will ever need, unless i need one small enough to carry with me.</li>
            <li> My words were few, and my time was short.</li>
            <li> ; wide.</li>
            <li> One for each room, plus a few for different purses, so</li>
            <li> I am so grateful to have found them, There is absolutely no substitute for Diamon Deb.  </li>
            <li> My nails are essential to my livelihood, and they&#x27;re always just right with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8&amp;#34; length has become very difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying Ruby and other nail files instead.</li>
            <li> You can file in either direction with a DiamonDeb without the fear of ripping your nails, like you will if you use an emery board or other &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; wannabe.</li>
            <li> I have always owned and used a Diamond Deb 8 inch nailfile; since 1972 as a matter of fact; they have become very hard to find,  This vendor said he only had three 8 inch files left; I ordered all three; he sent me TWO 8 inch files, and ONE 4 inch file.  </li>
            <li> I recommend only the 8\\&quot; ones, which are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking in every store I can find that could possibly sell this type of product, for the past few months, with no luck.</li>
            <li> Finally found a replacement for my Diamond Deb that I have had at least 20 Years.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I bought two a couple years ago and was again disappointed to find that a great product had cratered.</li>
            <li> Quality has gone down, noticeably.    </li>
            <li> I had two of them for probably 30 yrs before they wore down into uselessness.  </li>
            <li> It beats any other file I have ever tried, hands down!</li>
            <li> The shorter versions are less efficient.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my thumb nail took the abrasive off the file...that&#x27;s just wrong!  </li>
            <li> The little metal chips came off when I used it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know why the new one I bought had a broken tip, a bad sanding surface, and didn&#x27;t really file well.</li>
            <li> , These file have been a round for years.  </li>
            <li> not sure where I got it, but the brand name was inscribed on the side.</li>
            <li> I ordered a small fortune of these for all family members.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use tips anymore and therefore cannot give any experience on how it would work with them, but having used tips and overlays in the past, I would recommend the coarser emory boards over this file.</li>
            <li> I have extremely hard fingernails</li>
            <li> My late mother was a manicurist and used Diamon Deb files.  </li>
            <li> I lost/misplaced one I had for at least 15 years and purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the modern Diamon Deb nail files.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a fluke, and bought another, even worse.</li>
            <li> You cannot cannot cannot go wrong with a diamond deb.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this, sadly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry to see it not sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the nail file, per se.</li>
            <li> But alas!  </li>
            <li> but they are often difficult to find in drug stores.</li>
            <li> Sally Beauty Supply often has the shorter lengths, though too expensively, but almost no one stocks the 8&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> Love it. Does the job, very sturdy compared to the flimsy nail files I was used to!</li>
            <li> The new Diamon Debs seem to work just as well as the ones made over the years. The surface is durable in that it work for ages. There are some copies, but they seem to wear out faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to get accustomed to using it, for it takes off a lot of edge with each stroke. It&#x27;s not a wimpy emery board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It make shaping very fast.</li>
            <li> I really like my new nail file.  It is very rough, but the one it is replacing was 45 years old, so I&#x27;m in the adjusting to \\&quot;new\\&quot; phase.  The customer service is beyond excellent, I didn&#x27;t receive the first one I ordered &amp; they sent me another one w/o question or making any fuss.  They are very fantastic to work with.  The file is what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I lost my 1970&#x27;s vintage Diamond Deb nail file in the mid 90&#x27;s (at least I thought I had) and found a new Diamond Deb file at a discount hair care chain store.  The first time I used it, my thumb nail took the abrasive off the file...that&#x27;s just wrong!  I took the file back to the store and struggled for a couple of years with emory boards, other brands of files, etc when I unexpectedly found my trusty old Diamond Deb.  Here it is 2010 and it&#x27;s still going strong - I nearly keep it under lock and key!  In short, don&#x27;t buy one of the new ones, because it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> For some reason, these are not as good as the originals. I&#x27;ve had a 6 inch for 10 years and it still is great.</li>
            <li> Diamon Deb nail files were just about as close as you could get to a perfect product: well designed, a great price, easy to find, and a pleasure to use.  I didn&#x27;t know why the new one I bought had a broken tip, a bad sanding surface, and didn&#x27;t really file well. I thought it was a fluke, and bought another, even worse. Then I saw it was now made in China. Quality has gone down, noticeably.    Definitely not the same product as the made-in-USA file. I wish I could find an old one on sale. I&#x27;d keep it forever. The new one, and the one I bought after that, just don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li> excellent product - sent immediately.</li>
            <li> Since I  had one that I have used some 20 years, I was delighted to see that they are still available.  They are so much better than an ordinary emory board.</li>
            <li> These are the best fingernail files out there.  I finally wore out the ones I bought 20 years ago. I recommend only the 8\\&quot; ones, which are hard to find.  The shorter versions are less efficient.</li>
            <li> The last two I had lasted more than 50 years. Superb product.</li>
            <li> I was given one of these nail files 30 years ago and I still use it.  The file has not lost it&#x27;s filing granules even now.  It files smoothly yet without a lot of pressure. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores in my area and am so excited to find it is still being made.  I want one for my office drawer, my purse, my home, and my travel bag. The only change that could be made it to have one with a rounded end instead of pointed (even though I like the pointed end) so that it would go through security checks in airport. I travel frequently and like to carry it in my purse.  I highly recommend this over any emery board or any other type nail file.</li>
            <li> Apologies and words of love should not rely on a nail file. Mine did, and for finding on the fly a Diamon Deb file, my love forever remains my love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When in a desperate strait so many years ago, when the time to write to her something of bliss and beauty, my pencil tip broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting in a New York park, I asked around. Not a pencil or pen to be found. With the postman in view, I knew what to do, and told my woe. An older woman with perfect nails heard my heart and my tale, and delivered romantic salvation with the Diamion Deb file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Boy Scout resilience and pluck, I shaved and I trimmed. A little lead would be enough. My words were few, and my time was short. With a thank you to a patient postman, and a stamp with a picture of James Dean, my work was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May you always be on the ready to write your loved one by retaining a Diamon Deb file in your briefcase or bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Brockeim</li>
            <li> I have one of these purchased by my Mother in the 1960&#x27;s. Last Christmas one of my daughters asked if I had a nail file she could use. I whipped out this 40 some year old file and she wanted one just like. Imagine my surprise when I found them still being made. Guess what my daughters are getting this Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have been using this file since the 70s and it still works great.  Recently lost it and was going nuts trying to find it in stores.  Bless the internet!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on higher priced brands or low end ones.  This is THE best nail file on the market.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product. Fast shipping and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to finally locate this product after years of limping along with my old \\&quot;Diamon Deb\\&quot; file.  I ordered 2.  My purchase was shipped promptly and I can finally discard the old one.</li>
            <li> You cannot cannot cannot go wrong with a diamond deb. This is the third I&#x27;ve purchased in 30+ years. WOW!</li>
            <li> Great nail file, These file have been a round for years.  They are hard to find and they are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best file I have ever used particularly because of the very unique pointed tip. I purchased a 4\\&quot; file in Canada over 25 years ago and just recently lost mine. I have been looking in every store I can find that could possibly sell this type of product, for the past few months, with no luck. As a last ditch effort I thought I would try the internet, thank god for the internet! The filing portion works great in shaping the nail and removing those small cracks and tears, but what I particularly liked about this file is the pointed tip at the opposite end. I do a lot of gardening and don&#x27;t like to wear gloves, all other files I have tried that have a rounded point or are hooked, just don&#x27;t seem to clean everything under and around the nail, especially as my nails are rather curved. This one does the trick every time. I am glad I decided to try to find it on the internet. An excellent investment for anyone looking for a good long lasting file. Regards Maxie</li>
            <li> I  ordered this because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. I have had one of these for about 50 years, and it is getting a little old. The new one works great!</li>
            <li> Amazon is amazing!  I had a nail file like this already which I really liked -- not sure where I got it, but the brand name was inscribed on the side. I wanted to get one just like it for my daughter, so on a whim typed the product name into my browser, and lo and behold, found it for sale on Amazon at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I ordered a small fortune of these for all family members.  I&#x27;ve been using these for a good portion of my life, glad to have found them on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Finally found a replacement for my Diamond Deb that I have had at least 20 Years.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find these nail files were still being made. I have one given to me in 1963. Merck Drug Company gave these away to people in the medical field back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tad more flexible now, but still that great product that will last for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My transaction with this seller was a winner too!</li>
            <li> This file is not the quality of the old one I had. It works better than any others on the market that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Have used Diamond Deb nail files for years. Don&#x27;t like the new tip design doesn&#x27;t get under the nail well. I used an old one and reshaped the end works well now. Would have been 5 stars if not for the redesign of the tip</li>
            <li> I have always owned and used a Diamond Deb 8 inch nailfile; since 1972 as a matter of fact; they have become very hard to find,  This vendor said he only had three 8 inch files left; I ordered all three; he sent me TWO 8 inch files, and ONE 4 inch file.  Not worth the trouble to return the whole order; he ALMOST got it right, well two thirds anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Even the packing slip said, three 8 inch files, but I RECIEVED: two 8s, one 4</li>
            <li> Had one for several years but lost it.  It was still good after 20 years and couldn&#x27;t live without one!</li>
            <li> My late mother was a manicurist and used Diamon Deb files.  I had two of them for probably 30 yrs before they wore down into uselessness.  The current files made under that name look the same, but don&#x27;t last more than a couple of years of single-user use.&lt;br /&gt;Better than an emery board, but not by much.</li>
            <li> Wish this file were a bit wider--otherwise love it.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find a source for these too, but when I received them, they were stamped \\&quot;China\\&quot;. The old ones are stamped \\&quot;USA\\&quot; The originals have a sharper point, a feature which I personally make great use of. The Chinese version has a rounded point which is far less effective for cleaning under the nails. I still have two of the old ones, but they have lost some of their filing strength. I use the newer ones, but am disappointed in the lack of quality. They are still superior to anything else on the market that I have been able to find. Much better than the glass ones and the new emery ones mounted on foam board, both types of which are too thick to even use well in the space between the nail and the finger. It seems to be impossible to avoid the changes which are repeatedly made to products which have already been perfected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Diamon Deb nail files for years when I could find them and I loved them. The quality now is not near what it used to be when they were made in the USA. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know of one that&#x27;s comparable to the Diamondeb??</li>
            <li> I first learned about diamond deb from my guitar teacher in college and have been using them ever since. I use them for my baby now as well. They file very smoothly and don&#x27;t leave any jagged edges like the cross cut metal files would leave. I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention to the size and purchased the 8&amp;#34; file by accident, probably should have gone 6&amp;#34;. Unless you&#x27;re using this a ton or working in a salon it&#x27;s probably too long to just carry around with you so I&#x27;d go with one of the shorter options. But if you do your nails a lot or are going to carry this in a purse you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about the quality of nail files and you just cannot beat Diamon Deb files.  Wish I had payed more attention to sizes as the 8 inch is a little long for me.</li>
            <li> The Diamon Deb Nail File is exactly the product that I had been looking for.  The shipping was timely.</li>
            <li> Nail files are not like they use to be, but this one seems balanced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Diamondeb nail files over the years, but they had what I feel was a better &amp;#34;point&amp;#34;.  The one I received after making this purchase has a more rounded tip, which doesn&#x27;t seem to clean under the nails as well.  I&#x27;m hoping to find the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; style at a retail shop.&lt;br /&gt;The ordering and receiving of this item went very smoothly.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Diamon Deb nail file does a nice job filing your nails.  Doesn&#x27;t tear them like a lot of metal files.  I highly recommend the Diamon Deb</li>
            <li> A;though a little long, this will probably be the last nail file I will ever need, unless i need one small enough to carry with me.</li>
            <li> I love these nail files. Thought I wish they would make a slightly nicer case for it, They are easy to lose in those flimsy plastic holders they come in.</li>
            <li> I thought that I had ordered the larger model...8&amp;#34; long but 2&amp;#34; wide. I was really disappointed when this one arrived.&lt;br /&gt;No sense sending it back because the postage would cost more than the item itself! I use the one I have to do&lt;br /&gt;my dogs&#x27; nails. The smaller size is totally inadequate! I thought I had ordered from a photo. I will not order from&lt;br /&gt;this company again.</li>
            <li> I looked for many years for a Diamon Deb file to replace one I&#x27;d lost which I purchased in the late 1960&#x27;s. At that time you could go to the &amp;#34;beauty counter&amp;#34; in your locally owned pharmacy and purchase one.  After the large chain stores sidelined the local guy, no more Diamon Deb.  What a wonderful surprise to fine them again on Amazon.  Now I have one for every purse and spares for the future!</li>
            <li> no longer pointed lfike the old ones--I prefer the old style</li>
            <li> They used to make these in the USA, because I have an old one that says so; Three stars for being made in China.</li>
            <li> I had no luck finding these Daimon Deb files at local and chain drug stores. So I went to Amazon and found plenty.&lt;br /&gt;My wife had had one for 20 years that had become worn out, do I bought her several as stocking stuffers at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;These are the best finger nail files you can get and the Chinese knockoffs do not last.</li>
            <li> I got one of these for Xmas 2 years ago and before the next Christmas came around it was RUSTED all over the filing surface. I would NOT recommend this, sadly. Years ago it was the best file around but not anymore...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the 6 inch version for many years and decided it was time for a new one.  I wish I had stuck with the 6 inch.  This one is just a little bit too big in my opinion, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a good and functional product.</li>
            <li> Too rough for human nails..</li>
            <li> Great nail file.  I had been looking for these to give my daughter.  I have two I have used for at least 25 years and had not been able to find them anywhere in stores.  They provide a smooth shaping of the nail and do not nick or damage it.</li>
            <li> Classical Guitarists spend a lot of time with nail care, in particular the right hand combination of fingertip and nail are responsible for producing the warm, vibrant tones of the instrument. Experimentation with nail shape to produce the most consistent tone is a never ending process ... nail characteristics  change naturally over time. This is the product recommended by my teacher for shaping and it does an excellent job. I was extremely pleased that this is now available on line.</li>
            <li> I have used these for many, many years.  Best nail file available.  I lost/misplaced one I had for at least 15 years and purchased this one.  it is considerably sharper so glad it happened.</li>
            <li> Love these nail files</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one like this for 40 years and have always loved it.  It&#x27;s like a metal emery board.  I couldn&#x27;t find another one for years.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> This by far, in my opinion, is the best fingernail file ever made.  I&#x27;m so sorry to see it not sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> These files are not as readily available as they once were.  It is a gret product and I use it often!</li>
            <li> this file replaced one that I have used for several years and is great.Jane</li>
            <li> Better than the file I had! this one is very abrasive and perfect!</li>
            <li> The surface was too coarse to use on nails.  The little metal chips came off when I used it and it cut my finger.  I threw it away out of frustration.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these files. I work with my hands all day and this file is perfect for keeping my nails manageable , clean and beautiful. I totally recommend this and the 6&amp;#34; version which I already have. I&#x27;ll never use an emery board again .</li>
            <li> This is the standard for classical guitarists and any other pickers that use their nails. It slices the nail, it does not abrade. I smooth them afterward with superfine sandpaper and the nail pops the string perfectly.</li>
            <li> These last longer than most and it like the pointed end for cleaning my fingernails.  However, not quite as good as they used to be (because they are now made in China?).</li>
            <li> Best Nail file used lost and had to get replacement had first one for over 25 years!</li>
            <li> GREAT file.....these have been around forever and the quality is great</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the nail file, per se. I was looking for something with a coarser graini ,and settled for this.</li>
            <li> okay, but not like my old ones</li>
            <li> Much better than your usual emory board.  It doesn&#x27;t tear nails - it gently files them.  A friend had one and I used it and it operated sooo much different from those emory boards one buys from drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great help for aging nails.</li>
            <li> These are simply the best. We&#x27;ve been using them for decades for a good reason - they work! And they last a very long time!</li>
            <li> This one replaced an old one that I&#x27;ve had for probably 15 years. They last forever and work so well. Well worth spending a few bucks on vs the disposable type files.</li>
            <li> IMHO this is the best for the money last 20 times longer than those paper ones</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law gave me one 44 yrs ago and I loved it; after a couple of moves I lost it and couldn&#x27;t find anymore..  Saw this and jumped on it and I LOVE IT!!!  Files cleaner than emery boards and much easier to use than the fat wide ones that are suppose to be &amp;#34;so chicy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000196U04 Diamon Deb Nail Files 8\\&quot;]]    I am very disappointed in the modern Diamon Deb nail files. I love my Diamon Deb nail files that were made in the USA a few years back. They are now made in China, and it shows. I recently got a new one and was surprised at how poor it was. The surfaces were much rougher than my made-in-the-USA Diamon Deb nail files, and there didn&#x27;t seem to be a finer side to it at all. It seemed to tear my nails more than file them (I have thin nails). I will not get another one. I&#x27;m trying Ruby and other nail files instead.</li>
            <li> I have used Diamon Deb nail files since I was in high school, it seems.  A long time (I am 66).  I&#x27;ve always love them because they were the ONLY file that had a pointy tip that went under the tip of my nails, that I could use not only to file my nails well, but also to clean them.  They have been getting more and more difficult to find lately.  What&#x27;s with this?  Why do stores not sell them anymore?  Also, I lose nail files.  These cost enough that I don&#x27;t want to keep losing them.  So, I bought a bunch of them at once.  One for each room, plus a few for different purses, so I would always have a file when I need one.  But alas!  I am SO disappointed. The company changed something in their design this time.  It seems the pointy ends 1) Are NOT quite as pointy, and 2) even seem to be somewhat curved, making insertion under the nail tip a bit more difficult, and 3) are minutely thicker at the end, making it even MORE difficult to insert under the nail end.  Also the metal grit on them seems a bit harsher . . . just not as smooth of a stroke over the nail . . .  They seem much cheaper than they used to be.  Everything is, I guess.  We Americans have been growing accustomed to cheaper products in every respect, made with less care and less love.  Down to a simple, old-standard style nail file.  These will do.  Barely.  But they will still do.  Dear Diamon Deb manufacturer: Please do not dumb down this product one more time!!!  If you do, there will be no reason to buy it anymore.  It is barely hanging on as &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34; at this point.  I would love it if you went back to your old specs, whatever and however they were before you changed them.  (I haven&#x27;t had to buy Diamon Debs for several years because these files do  -- or &amp;#34;did&amp;#34; used to -- last for a while.  Which is why I took the liberty of buying 9 of them at once.  (You wouldn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d change the specs on a longstanding product such as this one).  So, I have no idea when they changed the files.  But . . . consumer beware: They ain&#x27;t what they used to be.les.  But . . . consumer beware: They ain&#x27;t what they used to be.</li>
            <li> The file works fine on our tough toe nails too as well as on our finger nails. thank you very much.,</li>
            <li> This is a great nail file and it seems to last forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of these files.  Been using them for 20+ years but they are often difficult to find in drug stores.</li>
            <li> I have extremely hard fingernails and this is the only nail file that will hold up to years of filing abuse.</li>
            <li> I have used Diamond Deb files for years. My old one was getting a bit dull and I could not find one in a store. I just searched for it on Amazon - and there it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and my nails are much happier when I file them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these files, which come in different lengths, for years, and they really do stand up.  But the 8\\&quot; file does not make it through TSA screening at airports: don&#x27;t pack in a carry-on bag.  The longer files get confiscated. That&#x27;s the only reason why I needed a replacement one.</li>
            <li> I made the switch from emory boards back to the metal file several months ago.  This is the type of file we used when I was a child, only better, and there&#x27;s no comparison for simply filing your nails.  The grit is very fine and does not cause the nail to split or peel while filing.  Unless you use tips and overlays, this file is best file for your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use tips anymore and therefore cannot give any experience on how it would work with them, but having used tips and overlays in the past, I would recommend the coarser emory boards over this file.</li>
            <li> Smooth filing. Much better than an emery board or rough metal file. I prefer diamond dust files above all others.</li>
            <li> I was in the beauty business for most of my life. I found the DiamonDeb nail file YEARS ago. It beats any other file I have ever tried, hands down! No pun intended! You can file in either direction with a DiamonDeb without the fear of ripping your nails, like you will if you use an emery board or other &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; wannabe. Your nails will be perfectly shaped, and smooth, without the little pieces of nail that snag everything from filing with another file. I won&#x27;t settle for anything but a DiamonDeb!</li>
            <li> Quite powerful - does a quick job.</li>
            <li> This is not the wonderful file I loved years ago. This one isn&#x27;t finely ground, the rough material catches and tears the edges of my nails. Maybe it has an industrial or handy person use but it&#x27;s useless for the fine, smooth filing of the original. I would have sent it back but it was cheap...and I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I just filed my nails using a Diamon Deb  (8&amp;#34;) that I have used since 1959.&lt;br /&gt;Have no intention of ever replacing it--hopefully it will be used by someone in&lt;br /&gt;our family 50+ more years.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting and working out great.</li>
            <li> Just like my grandma, it will be my very favorite file.</li>
            <li> I have used these files for many years.  My nails split and many files are just too rough.  Is there room for improvement?  Yes.  But, I have not been able to find it.  I don&#x27;t think the files hold up like they did years ago, but nothing else I have tried is as good.</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager this was an easy to find item.  I had looked in all the beauty supply stores, supermarkets and pharmacies to no avail.  Once I found it on line, I ordered it and it is, in my opinion, the best nail file made.</li>
            <li> This file is a plain piece of stainless steel.  It is fairly long.  It has a cleaner tip on the end.  It does what it is supposed to do and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these files for more than 30 years and it still does a great job and I wanted to have one to keep at home I just wish I had ordered the smaller 6&amp;#34; size like the one I have.</li>
            <li> Question? Are Dimond Deb and DiamonDeb the same brand?  Many reviews here seem to use the names interchangably.  I don&#x27;t know the manufacturor of the old diamond nail file I had years ago but it did seem smoother than the new file I just received.  I have includes a photo showing the tag on the file I received and the brand name stamped on the file and they are different. The file was advertised as a Diamond Deb and the file is stamped DiamonDeb made in China.  Just wondering if a substitution has taken place or if the the listing was a misprint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Diamon Deb files exclusively for many years.  As a professional pianist and keyboard player, my nails have to be at the perfect length all the time, and must also not be brittle as sometimes happens with other files or clippers.  My nails are essential to my livelihood, and they&#x27;re always just right with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8&amp;#34; length has become very difficult to find.  Sally Beauty Supply often has the shorter lengths, though too expensively, but almost no one stocks the 8&amp;#34;.  I am so grateful to have found them, There is absolutely no substitute for Diamon Deb.  I ordered 15 of these files last year, and may send for more!</li>
            <li> I have always like Diamon Deb files.  This size is just right for carrying in a purse.  I still think these are the best files.</li>
            <li> bought it for my brother in law and he loves it</li>
            <li> I last bought one of these files in 1972 and I&#x27;m still using it! I have looked for another one for literally decades --- why didn&#x27;t I think of Amazon sooner !?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These files last and last! They work great! They&#x27;re reasonably priced. I wish I could say this about everything I buy.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The original DiamonDeb files were fantastic. I am still using the one I&#x27;ve had for 40 years. Sorry to say, I bought two a couple years ago and was again disappointed to find that a great product had cratered. The new ones are rough, coarse, and of no use to me. I threw them away. Too bad, America, another great product has fallen due to manufacture overseas.</li>
            <li> Not like the diamond 20 years ago… This is super Ruff, so not useful finishing the nail...this is okay for calluses though</li>
            <li> Purchased for a siblings. She said it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Best nail file I have found on the market....Won&#x27;t use anything but this one.....</li>
