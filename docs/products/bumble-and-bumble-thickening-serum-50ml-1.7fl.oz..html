    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>There is no doubt hair is impressively thicker using this treatment.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the results!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s best to put in at night after showering.</li>
            <li>This product has been incredible for me.</li>
            <li>I feel great wearing my hair longer (just below shoulder length)</li>
            <li>I have been using Bumble and Bumble along with my Laser Hair hood and the results have been great.</li>
            <li>There has been a great improvement, with noticeable added fullness and volume.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>The older I get, the thinner my hair gets - especially on top.</li>
            <li>-- I never thought I&#x27;d be able to do this again.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews on here more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It just gives my hair a bit more oomph.</li>
            <li>Just very clean, no residue.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the hair of my glowing youth, but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle till the end believing that $30 liquid alcohol water will do some miracle but it never even did any good.</li>
            <li>and it did take a couple of weeks or so, to really see a difference, but this product has proven itself exceptional.</li>
            <li>It made my fine hair lankier and greasier than ever.</li>
            <li>I can not believe my hair since I started using this product - it doesn&#x27;t just feel thicker and more full - it&#x27;s so soft, frizz free, smooth and just shines.  </li>
            <li>I have light colored, very fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using it super consistently</li>
            <li>For me, it made a difference right away -- within a week, I&#x27;d say -- and I&#x27;ve been using it continuously for over a year now.</li>
            <li>and he was right.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it - and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all or make me need to wash more like some products do.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone with fine hair, as it really does help.</li>
            <li>A hairdresser recommended this to me, but did warn me that it must be used consistently.</li>
            <li>VERY highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This REALLY REALLY works.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that it would work.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this thickening serum, not expecting much.</li>
            <li>Very drying.........lots of alcohol?</li>
            <li>This B&amp;B Thickening Serum really helps.</li>
            <li>and I have been a student on a budget, so I appreciated the honesty and realistic perspective.</li>
            <li>Will definately buy again and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Thickens convincingly I guess, but even one application every other day completely dried my ends out to the point of pretty significant breakage.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The B&amp;B also works well as daily hair treatment with a little Potion No. 9 mixed in for great control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stop using this right away and take it back to the store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product, and one of the only things I can put on my very fine and thin hair day after day without heavy build up and weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I have been so surprised</li>
            <li>So far I have been using it for 6 months and there is a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>The bottle does direct you towards night use and on damp hair before styling if you choose.</li>
            <li>have used the product before as was recommended by my stylist and works very well and actually thickens hair as it says!</li>
            <li>I used to have thick hair but over the years it became fine</li>
            <li>I wasted SO MUCH MONEY on this garbage!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a middle aged male and people have really noticed !!  </li>

            <li> I wasted SO MUCH MONEY on this garbage!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged male and people have really noticed !!  </li>
            <li> used once only and left the ends of my hair feeling dry and brittle&lt;</li>
            <li> It may be a bit pricey like a lot of Bumble &amp; Bumble but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair was SO MUCH HARDER to style, and it DEFINITELY wasn&#x27;t thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have to agree with Lesley S - this product was a complete waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I am going to continue to use it so as not to waste, but this would not be my first choice in a thickening serum again, which is sad since I had such high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> (And DRY.)  </li>
            <li> I only use a small amount (2-3 pumps) in the morning and concentrate on the root area.</li>
            <li> The results aren&#x27;t anything drastic, but I do notice a difference on days when I use this (even without any other products) and days I use nothing at all.</li>
            <li> What it does it strips down all the oils from your hair strands and it appear thicker.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, I started to use this product and within a week my head has tons of tiny little bumps like pimples on it</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I agree with the ones that state it made their hair \\&quot;staticky\\&quot; or \\&quot;flyaway\\&quot;, and that it dried out the hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy into products like this</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 and 1/2 weeks...and my hair just looked worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soo stinking expensive though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had slowly realized that I just couldn&#x27;t wear it longer than chin length without looking plain horrible.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing for a b&amp;b product, and very expensive too.</li>
            <li> Probably the worst $27 purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li> I wish so bad I could return this product!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This REALLY REALLY works. It takes about 4-5 weeks. There is no doubt hair is impressively thicker using this treatment. VERY highly recommended. I have not reviewed any products before this one.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out because I had an Amazon gift card. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference. I was really hoping that it would work. I am going to continue to use it so as not to waste, but this would not be my first choice in a thickening serum again, which is sad since I had such high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy into products like this but I stumbled upon Bumble &amp; Bumble shampoo once and found that it made a big difference and then noticed this stuff. When I started using it, I had given up on my hair. I used to have thick hair but over the years it became fine and I had slowly realized that I just couldn&#x27;t wear it longer than chin length without looking plain horrible. I decided to try this thickening serum, not expecting much. For me, it made a difference right away -- within a week, I&#x27;d say -- and I&#x27;ve been using it continuously for over a year now. I have been so surprised -- it&#x27;s like I have my hair from 10 years ago. It&#x27;s not the hair of my glowing youth, but it&#x27;s pretty good. I feel great wearing my hair longer (just below shoulder length) -- I never thought I&#x27;d be able to do this again. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I can not believe my hair since I started using this product - it doesn&#x27;t just feel thicker and more full - it&#x27;s so soft, frizz free, smooth and just shines.  I absolutely love it - and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all or make me need to wash more like some products do.  Just very clean, no residue.  Will definately buy again and would highly recommend.  It may be a bit pricey like a lot of Bumble &amp; Bumble but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you know anything about ingredients and what they do to your hair - take a look at the bottle of the Thickening serum. You will see that there are tons of different types of alcohol. What it does it strips down all the oils from your hair strands and it appear thicker. I used the whole bottle till the end believing that $30 liquid alcohol water will do some miracle but it never even did any good. Waste of money. I am wondering if people that write 5 star reviews for this product are paid to do so or its just sellers themselves do that. Probably the worst $27 purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble along with my Laser Hair hood and the results have been great. I&#x27;m a middle aged male and people have really noticed !!  The B&amp;B also works well as daily hair treatment with a little Potion No. 9 mixed in for great control. Ciao.. Bruce</li>
            <li> Thickens convincingly I guess, but even one application every other day completely dried my ends out to the point of pretty significant breakage. The bottle recommends two applications daily, which I can&#x27;t even imagine.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews on here more thoroughly.  I agree with the ones that state it made their hair \\&quot;staticky\\&quot; or \\&quot;flyaway\\&quot;, and that it dried out the hair.  My hair was SO MUCH HARDER to style, and it DEFINITELY wasn&#x27;t thicker.  I used it for 2 and 1/2 weeks...and my hair just looked worse and worse.  (And DRY.)  I wish so bad I could return this product!!  I wasted SO MUCH MONEY on this garbage!!</li>
            <li> After trying countless hair strengthening products I came across the thickening serum by chance recommended by my hair stylist. So far I have been using it for 6 months and there is a noticeable difference. Very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I like the product it makes your hair appear thicker. I will keep buying it. My son recommended I get it and he was right.</li>
            <li> Very drying.........lots of alcohol? used once only and left the ends of my hair feeling dry and brittle&lt;br /&gt;waste of money B &amp; B !!!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, I started to use this product and within a week my head has tons of tiny little bumps like pimples on it and it hurts!  I&#x27;m going to stop using this right away and take it back to the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it super consistently so I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness but I can tell you it massively gives me dandruff flakes. Really big flakes!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to agree with Lesley S - this product was a complete waste of money for me. It made my fine hair lankier and greasier than ever. Very disappointing for a b&amp;b product, and very expensive too.</li>
            <li> This product has been incredible for me. I have light colored, very fine/thin hair. A hairdresser recommended this to me, but did warn me that it must be used consistently. This can become a bit pricey and I have been a student on a budget, so I appreciated the honesty and realistic perspective. I only use a small amount (2-3 pumps) in the morning and concentrate on the root area. There has been a great improvement, with noticeable added fullness and volume. I have been using this product for almost two years and it did take a couple of weeks or so, to really see a difference, but this product has proven itself exceptional. I would highly recommend this to anyone with fine hair, as it really does help.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  After use, people always compliment me on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Shame it&#x27;s soo stinking expensive though.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best to put in at night after showering.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked wonders for my hair. I highly recommend this product. I seen results after 2 applications. Must buy</li>
            <li> This was a re-purchase. I&#x27;ve been using this serum off an on for probably four years now and this is only my second bottle. It&#x27;s a very good product, and one of the only things I can put on my very fine and thin hair day after day without heavy build up and weighing it down. The results aren&#x27;t anything drastic, but I do notice a difference on days when I use this (even without any other products) and days I use nothing at all. It just gives my hair a bit more oomph. The bottle does direct you towards night use and on damp hair before styling if you choose. I do the opposite and only apply to my damp hair just before styling in the mornings.</li>
            <li> The older I get, the thinner my hair gets - especially on top. This B&amp;B Thickening Serum really helps. BUT, it also smells like a lot of alcohol is in it.</li>
            <li> have used the product before as was recommended by my stylist and works very well and actually thickens hair as it says!</li>
            <li> If your hair is thinning,this makes it look and feel thicker.they are not kidding .Cant do with out</li>
