            <li>They are easy to put in my hair and so thankful that they come with the mircobeads.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to straighten or curl them.  </li>
            <li>i love the colors and they are true to the length i was promised in the description.</li>
            <li>It looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it just adds a nice touch of color in her hair, Very fashionable.</li>
            <li>thought they looked cheap</li>
            <li>Price is cheap, but don&#x27;t fall for it, check out shipping cost.  </li>
            <li>She was so excited.</li>
            <li>I got these in the brown/beige color and thought they were pretty cute.</li>
            <li>i would probably pick a different more colorful feather next time but these are still awesome</li>
            <li>NO SALON AROUND HERE CARRIES SUCH BRIGHT COLORS AND SOFTNESS.  </li>
            <li>i love the vibrant colors of the feather</li>
            <li>very beautiful colors but not extremely bright or anything.</li>
            <li>i will definitely be ordering from this company more often and the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li>if you are thinking about buying it buy it cheap price for real grizzly feathers.</li>
            <li>I love these feathers, they last a long time and the colors and also the length is good.  </li>
            <li>that tgey are real feather but very pricey and not that long but still very nice</li>
            <li>i just received my feathers in the mail and first off im in hawaii</li>
            <li>I have bought more when the last ones wore out.</li>
            <li>it only came with one extension and in the picture it shows many</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Nice long length, truly 8-12 inches and nice bright colors...got two grizzly and dark pink, light pink and teal...would purchase again!</li>
            <li>my granddaughter wants some I will definitely be getting more the price</li>
            <li>Not so much if you are looking for something comparable to the salon.</li>
            <li>An absolute rip off.</li>
            <li>My daughter is really into these feathers and asked for them for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I would be very up set if I payed five dollars for just one feather.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a few feathers at a decent price, and knew not to get my hopes up too high.</li>
            <li>I have taken them in and out and the feathers still look the same as the first day I got them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a complete rip off for $5!  </li>
            <li>but the description clearly states that you get 5 feathers BONDED together to make ONE extension.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>ALL OF MY 15 YEAR OLD DAUGHTERS FRIENDS HAVE CAME TO ME WANTING ME TO PUT IN A FEATHER....</li>
            <li>Old trick,</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>the most serious is that I bought several and I felt cheated when opening the package.</li>
            <li>Although its pretty, I don&#x27;t like the fact that I paid $5 for 1 little extension..</li>

            <li> If it weren&#x27;t a Christmas Present for my daughter, and I didn&#x27;t stupidly wait until the last minute to open it - I&#x27;d return it right now!!!</li>
            <li> One brown/copper and one pink with same brown feathers.  </li>
            <li> then i expected.</li>

            <li> They are also very, very thin.  </li>
            <li> I hate that the title says 5 FEATHERS.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
            <li> Insanely dissatisfied by the color, length and lack of feather.  </li>

            <li> i just received my feathers in the mail and first off im in hawaii and they came to my mailbox within 3 days which is awesome! and they are great!! i love the colors and they are true to the length i was promised in the description. i will definitely be ordering from this company more often and the price is unbeatable! im a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I wish they were slightly longer but they&#x27;re still awesome</li>
            <li> I love these feathers, they last a long time and the colors and also the length is good.  I have bought more when the last ones wore out.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my granddaughter.  For the price AND THE DESCRIPTION, I was going to be getting 5 Feathers with each set.  That&#x27;s what the title say - 5 Feathers.  I got one.  One brown/copper and one pink with same brown feathers.  That&#x27;s it.  Plus you have to pay shipping on both, so $4-$6 shipping x 2 and they ship them in the same manila envelope.  If I had time, I&#x27;d return them for a refund + shipping expense through Amazon.  That&#x27;s why we love Amazon!  However, I&#x27;ll see my granddaughter before I can buy anything else so I&#x27;ll give her these sets of a piece of dyed string and a feather (without the tool she needs to put them in.)  I hate that the title says 5 FEATHERS.  You pay $10 altogether for a string &amp; a skinny feather.  Then not combining the shipping for the two packets!  Add insult to injury - rip off!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a few feathers at a decent price, and knew not to get my hopes up too high. To put it simply, you get what you pay for, if that. The biggest disappointment I had was that combined shipping is not offered when buying several bundles of feathers. I paid about ten bucks in shipping for 3 sets that all came together in a regular envelope that probably took the cost of one stamp to send. Another thing to watch out for is the lengths in the descriptions. They are all listed in ranges since feathers run at all different lengths, but none of them came close to being as long as the description stated. The longest one in this bundle that I received was about 7 inches. They are also very, very thin.  If you are looking for something for your kids, then this would be great. Not so much if you are looking for something comparable to the salon.</li>
            <li> i love the vibrant colors of the feather and yes i said feather as if meaning only one dont let the products picture over throw you there is one absolutely gorgious feather and 2 beads to hold it in fast shipping and over all great product looks fab-u-ous in my hair and probably would in yours too!!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it! Not what it appears to be.</li>
            <li> were a little shorter then i expected. very beautiful colors but not extremely bright or anything. i would probably pick a different more colorful feather next time but these are still awesome it just depends on your color preference. ive had mine in for about a month and the color has not fadded at all. good buy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to other reviews. This product is amazing. It looks fantastic. the feathers came in beautiful packaging. there are five feathers bonded at the tip  to make one hair extension this product keeps its color. I would recommend this product to everyone. if you are thinking about buying it buy it cheap price for real grizzly feathers.</li>
            <li> cute but cant reuse&lt;br /&gt;look nice on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer these ones because they are longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish they were thicker or came with more than one in a package.</li>
            <li> From the picture, I had thought that I was going to be getting multiple hair extensions. But only one came in the mail. Guess it&#x27;s my fault for not reading enough about the description.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  False advertisement.  Insanely dissatisfied by the color, length and lack of feather.  An absolute rip off. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Beautifully dyed feathers just as described. Easy to put in since they are bonded together. Great product. Absolutely love my feathers. I wore them for months without any problems</li>
            <li> These colors are beautiful and my daughter loves them.  Her old ones have faded and these are the perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> I loveed the color and I like that tgey are real feather but very pricey and not that long but still very nice</li>
            <li> It wasnt a big bunch (as shown on the pic) but my daughter thought they where so cute! I would recommend</li>
            <li> it only came with one extension and in the picture it shows many</li>
            <li> ALL OF MY 15 YEAR OLD DAUGHTERS FRIENDS HAVE CAME TO ME WANTING ME TO PUT IN A FEATHER....THAT BY THE WAY NO SALON AROUND HERE CARRIES SUCH BRIGHT COLORS AND SOFTNESS.  THEY LOVE THE 5 FEATHERS IN 1 COMBO.  EASY TO PUT IN.</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughter. They are beautiful and very well made. Easy to install, discrete looking and it just adds a nice touch of color in her hair, Very fashionable.</li>
            <li> This item is awesome. The item is zoo easy to install. I recommend it to all my friends and associates.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care for it...didn&#x27;t look like picture and niece thought they looked cheap, don&#x27;t know if all look this way</li>
            <li> I love the colors of these feathers.  They were just what I wanted and more.  They are easy to put in my hair and so thankful that they come with the mircobeads.  All I had to do was place them and clamp the bead down with pliers.  I also make sure to order two so I have matching ones in.  I have taken them in and out and the feathers still look the same as the first day I got them.  It is easy to straighten or curl them.  The price can&#x27;t be beat either.  I will be ordering more of your feathers.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my girlies and they love them!  Nice long length, truly 8-12 inches and nice bright colors...got two grizzly and dark pink, light pink and teal...would purchase again!</li>

            <li> My daughter is really into these feathers and asked for them for Christmas. She was so excited. Very nice and has not faded on the hair. Also easy to put in hair!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, but a bit expensive to buy online. Not clear what you are getting, you get only one extension.  Price is cheap, but don&#x27;t fall for it, check out shipping cost.  Old trick, but I fell for it once again.</li>
            <li> Is the worst product I ever bought on amazon, not looking for anything like the images of samples. the most serious is that I bought several and I felt cheated when opening the package. I usually organize parties and would never recommend anyone buy them, is false advertising. They look so bad, cheap, horrible, that I threw, I was ashamed to show them or regararlas my guests at the party theme.&lt;br /&gt;Es el peor producto que he comprado en amazon, no luce para nada parecido a las imagenes de muestras. lo mas grave es que compré varias y me sentí estafada al abrir el paquete. yo suelo organizar fiestas y NUNCA recomendaria a nadie adquirirlas, es una publicidad engañosa. Lucen tan mal, baratas, horribles, que las boté, me daba verguenza enseñarselas o regararlas a mis invitadas en la fiesta tematica.</li>
            <li> I was thinking about purchasing this item, but noticed in the information box that this product did not include the hook to insert the bead with. I just wanted to be sure that this was true before purchasing a separate hook, so if anybody could confirm me on this, that would be great! thanks!</li>
            <li> Adorable.  Used it for my sisters hair and it looks awesome.  Will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> The title says 5 feathers....but the description clearly states that you get 5 feathers BONDED together to make ONE extension.I got these in the brown/beige color and thought they were pretty cute. I got the 4-6 inches though and they are a bit too short.&lt;br /&gt;I got similar extensions (4 feathers bonded to make one) that clips in from SUltra for $30!&lt;br /&gt;So in comparison I think these are a bargain and are just as cute</li>
            <li> Wow. I was NOT expecting only ONE extension. If you only want one, then this is for you. Do not get it if you want several.  Also the photos are deceiving. It shows many feathers and micro beads. Although its pretty, I don&#x27;t like the fact that I paid $5 for 1 little extension..</li>
            <li> These are great feathers. My daughter has had them on and has washed them combed them out and none have fell out. Great product!</li>
            <li> You get 5 teeny, tiny feathers...NOT WHAT IS PICTURED!  Do not buy this product.  It&#x27;s a complete rip off for $5!  If it weren&#x27;t a Christmas Present for my daughter, and I didn&#x27;t stupidly wait until the last minute to open it - I&#x27;d return it right now!!!</li>
            <li> i dont understand why some people are ok with this item. or love it. when the add says five feathers. NOT JUST ONE! I would be very up set if I payed five dollars for just one feather. especially when the add says FIVE FEATHERS! write this person a stern letter. demanding money or more product.</li>
