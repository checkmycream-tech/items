            <li>These pads are really a great product.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to order this product as needed because they are disposable after one use but still a great find.</li>
            <li>Her podiatrist was impressed that I was able to find this product for her.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>The product is good; my podiatrist agrees.  </li>
            <li>Orders via Amazon have been more successful.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found them!</li>
            <li>By far the best way to reduce the nerve discomfort.  </li>
            <li>It would be great if the pad could remind me to take it off before each shower ;-)</li>
            <li>Well designed and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I like dr s&#x27;s cushions much better</li>
            <li>They work a lot better than the ones that stick to the shoe.</li>
            <li>Works ok for most of the day</li>
            <li>If they made em&#x27; a 1/8 &amp;#34; thicker it would be better.</li>
            <li>Quality of material could be better comparing what is given in the Dr office as a result must be replaced more often.</li>
            <li>These are great and such a good price if you need to use one every day.</li>
            <li>I love these metatarsal pads.</li>
            <li>Makes those loooong runs a lot more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I am quite active and was born with not the best foot structure.  </li>
            <li>These pads are fabulous for that, however, they do squash up after one or two uses so you have to put two together,</li>
            <li>Felt is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It is made from cheap material, and there is no cushion for the foot.  </li>
            <li>However it does not stick adequately, and this is a significant limitation.  </li>
            <li>a decubitus.&lt;br /&gt;The service was quick.</li>
            <li>Adhesive is strong but not too much.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to get a week or more of use from a single pad when I remember to remove it before stepping into the shower.</li>
            <li>and they are just not as comfortable as a new one of these.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>The callus pads are okay, but after I walked on one awhile it flattened out to the point where I had to attach another one to it to get the proper thickness, thus doubling the cost.  </li>
            <li>These stick really well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be older stock or maybe was in a really hot place for a while.&lt;br</li>
            <li>goes flat very quickly, does not make it through the day.</li>
            <li>They really stay on well.</li>
            <li>Product is cut well and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>These work very well for me to raise the area around a corn.</li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>It definitely stays securely in place.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>This product really works well to cushion your foot.  </li>
            <li>Very comforting-can be cut to size and stays in place all day.</li>
            <li>These cushions are excellent in that they hold together (do not shred in the shoe), stick on well but not so firmly that they take the skin off with them, and are soft to the touch but very firm.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cents.</li>
            <li>So if you have to wear them constantly, and I do,  that adds up fast.</li>
            <li>I have tried the ones made out of soft rubber/jelly looking stuff</li>
            <li>I also see  podiatrist quite frequently, but these pads have saved me from infections and bone surgery.</li>
            <li>Severaal years ago, I would order direct from Footsmart.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>We used this item before, but purchased it directly from FootSmart.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway I would suggest purchasing this item directly from FootSmart.</li>
            <li>Such a simple thing and so useful.</li>
            <li>Even though they seem big in the photo, they really do fit as well as drugstore round pads into a pair of work pumps.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find that the pad can be removed before a shower and reapplied after the foot is dry.</li>
            <li>These really protect my callouses from breaking down and cracking.</li>

            <li> Having lost a bone and toe years back, which began with an open crack, I am extremely protective of my callouses.</li>
            <li> I use two of them, overlapping and facing in different directions (as in facing overlapping the ends toward each other for extra cushioning!</li>
            <li> Stays on for as long as you want it to, even after the beach or a shower.  </li>
            <li> as long as I can use these cushions, they can protect my foot and postpone, or maybe even cancel the&lt;br /&gt;operation that had been scheduled for me.  </li>
            <li> I tried several other products, none of which came close to this one.</li>
            <li> These pads are difficult to find locally, and they really work.</li>
            <li> After several weeks the irritation calmed and I fortunately no longer needed them.</li>
            <li> They stay in place winter or summer, wet or dry(including sweat).  </li>
            <li> These pads are only about 1/8 inch thick and of a much lesser quality than the Dr. gave me.  </li>
            <li> ordering information to him so that he could share with his other patients.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with mechanical corns and since I wear Jobst stockings all the time, these pads go a long way relieving the pressure from them on my corns.</li>
            <li> I bought these due to a sore metatarsal pad.</li>
            <li> By then there pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> but they do squish down quite a bit by the time I take them off at night.</li>
            <li> Several previous reviewers complained that the adhesive is not adequate and that the pad needs to be replaced after one or two days.</li>
            <li> When my workouts wear on my feet a little too hard, I use one or two of these to add extra comfort.</li>
            <li> and they cost less (and no shipping charge).</li>
            <li> and they cost much less.</li>
            <li> This usage eat pad, wish it was a little thicker</li>
            <li> Will not deviate from these again, though I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past.</li>
            <li> And what little cushion there is, it has no support for my callus</li>
            <li> And they are not cheap-</li>
            <li> Wear it everyday and hopefully the pain will go away after time as it  did for me.  </li>
            <li> Excessively.</li>
            <li> Product also known as horseshoe pads was hard to find but was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Too sticky and hard to remove.</li>
            <li> One of the problems that has progressed over time is thick callous circles on the bottom of my feet.  </li>
            <li> They are 1/8 inch thick</li>
            <li> Just now they are out of stock, and I wish they would stock not just these but also the 1/4 inch thick version.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my mother whose feet were twisted by rheumatoid arthritis, and she needs them to cushion her foot around a slightly protruding bone.  </li>
            <li> Allows for faster healing when decreased amounts of body weight pressure are spread out over a wider area of the foot.</li>
            <li> , I am very disappointed and will not purchase this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> Unfortunate.  </li>
            <li> Too bad you can&#x27;t get anymore on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Provides cushioning around the callus that has formed,from years of running, at the base of her 1st metatarsal.  </li>
            <li> I have very bad feet</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are great and a great bargain also. I have very bad feet and these are a life saver.</li>
            <li> I have a neuroma in the middle of the ball of my foot. These pads are fabulous for that, however, they do squash up after one or two uses so you have to put two together, etc. And they are not cheap- I got them from Footsmart and there were 20 of them in the package for $12. or 40 for $20. plus shipping. So if you have to wear them constantly, and I do,  that adds up fast. I have tried the ones made out of soft rubber/jelly looking stuff and they are just not as comfortable as a new one of these.&lt;br /&gt;And yes indeed, Footsmart floods you with catalogs in the mail and with email. Excessively.</li>
            <li> These really protect my callouses from breaking down and cracking. They also alleviate pain. Having lost a bone and toe years back, which began with an open crack, I am extremely protective of my callouses. I also see  podiatrist quite frequently, but these pads have saved me from infections and bone surgery.</li>
            <li> The product is good; my podiatrist agrees.  However, once you&#x27;re on Footsmart&#x27;s mailing list, be prepared for a deluge of ads, both via email and printed catalogs.  Severaal years ago, I would order direct from Footsmart. Orders via Amazon have been more successful.</li>
            <li> Bought for elderly mom. Helped to ease pain. Her podiatrist was impressed that I was able to find this product for her.&lt;br /&gt;Gave ordering information to him so that he could share with his other patients.</li>
            <li> By far the best way to reduce the nerve discomfort.  Wear it everyday and hopefully the pain will go away after time as it  did for me.  I tried several other products, none of which came close to this one.</li>
            <li> This usage eat pad, wish it was a little thicker</li>
            <li> The callus pads are okay, but after I walked on one awhile it flattened out to the point where I had to attach another one to it to get the proper thickness, thus doubling the cost.  Sorry to say I found a better (thicker) pad that looks similar at my local pharmacy and they cost less (and no shipping charge).</li>
            <li> Adhesive is strong but not too much.  Felt is comfortable.  Even though they seem big in the photo, they really do fit as well as drugstore round pads into a pair of work pumps.  Worth the extra cents.</li>
            <li> Product also known as horseshoe pads was hard to find but was just what I needed.This cushion can be used around a sore to product  it from pressure, ie a decubitus.&lt;br /&gt;The service was quick.</li>
            <li> When my workouts wear on my feet a little too hard, I use one or two of these to add extra comfort. I position them differently, just wherever the ball of my foot is sore.</li>
            <li> I use them for bunions and metatarsal areas. They really stay on well.</li>
            <li> Product is cut well and reasonably priced. However it does not stick adequately, and this is a significant limitation.  This could be improved</li>
            <li> These work very well for me to raise the area around a corn. Will not deviate from these again, though I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past.</li>
            <li> I have a swollen fascia under my 2nd toe; you can place these wherever you need relief and it works!</li>
            <li> Suddenly had an area of a dropped bone start killing me. Podiatrist offered no relief except to suggest surgery. Found these and started using them.  After several weeks the irritation calmed and I fortunately no longer needed them. Such a simple thing and so useful.</li>
            <li> Cushion callous on foot to prevent pain. These pads are difficult to find locally, and they really work. Glad to have found them!</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended and gave me a set. I could not believe the immediate relief.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE HAD A CALLOUS ON THE BOTTOM OF HER FOOT, AND THIS WAS JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED, EVENTHOU THE DOCTOR DIDN&#x27;T ORDER IT.</li>
            <li> Too sticky and hard to remove. When I tried to peel it off my foot at the end of the day pieces came apart and stuck to my foot. I had to pick at it to get all the bits of fabric off my foot. Definitely would not buy this again and I do not recommend this product. I like dr s&#x27;s cushions much better and they cost much less.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing foot pain and learned that I would need a bunionectomy on both feet. These pads helped to cushion my feet and alleviate some of the pressure and pain between diagnosis and surgery. Purchasing these online provided quite a discount over my local med supply store. The locals stored only carried them in packs of 10 or 12 and I had months to burn and so purchasing these in bulk was a great time saver for me as well.</li>
            <li> Is not sticking to the bottom of my foot as well as it used to. Would use again but hope they will improve the adhesive.</li>
            <li> Work very well. I have a lot of trouble with mechanical corns and since I wear Jobst stockings all the time, these pads go a long way relieving the pressure from them on my corns.</li>
            <li> Great for sore feet. East to apply. I could not find these in my local drugstores.  Delivered as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought these due to a sore metatarsal pad. These stick really well! They work a lot better than the ones that stick to the shoe. This sticks to your foot. It definitely stays securely in place.</li>
            <li> These cushions are wonderful for ball of foot pain - give added support where needed without having to align in shoe</li>
            <li> goes flat very quickly, does not make it through the day.</li>
            <li> They work very well. Too bad you can&#x27;t get anymore on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Stays on for as long as you want it to, even after the beach or a shower.  Well designed and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Totally saves my feet! Thank you thank you thank you!</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t stick to your skin</li>
            <li> as long as I can use these cushions, they can protect my foot and postpone, or maybe even cancel the&lt;br /&gt;operation that had been scheduled for me.  Wow.  What a relief!</li>
            <li> We used this item before, but purchased it directly from FootSmart. It was excellent. Works we removed the pad (with the adheasive backing) from the card, the pad would seperate or stick to the card and not release properly. Therefore it was unuisable.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to Amazon regarding this and they would not handle my complaint.&lt;br /&gt;It may be older stock or maybe was in a really hot place for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I would suggest purchasing this item directly from FootSmart.</li>
            <li> Has been instrumental in removing pressure from a pressure wound of a diabetic foot. Allows for faster healing when decreased amounts of body weight pressure are spread out over a wider area of the foot.</li>
            <li> Works ok for most of the day but they do squish down quite a bit by the time I take them off at night. By then there pretty much useless. If they made em&#x27; a 1/8 &amp;#34; thicker it would be better. Sticks very good to you&#x27;re skin and doesn&#x27;t move at all......RBC</li>
            <li> I am quite active and was born with not the best foot structure.  One of the problems that has progressed over time is thick callous circles on the bottom of my feet.  My podiatrist told me I would have to accept the fact that I couldn&#x27;t walk barefoot anymore.  Well these cushions let me walk barefoot at home all day without pain.  THEY ARE GREAT!!!!!!!!  I also wear them with my aerobic &amp; running shoes.  Really great product.</li>
            <li> Quality of material could be better comparing what is given in the Dr office as a result must be replaced more often. Works as designed.</li>
            <li> These are great and such a good price if you need to use one every day.</li>
            <li> It is made from cheap material, and there is no cushion for the foot.  And what little cushion there is, it has no support for my callus, I am very disappointed and will not purchase this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> These pads are only about 1/8 inch thick and of a much lesser quality than the Dr. gave me.  Unfortunate.  Will not order again.</li>

These cushions are excellent in that they hold together (do not shred in the shoe), stick on well but not so firmly that they take the skin off with them, and are soft to the touch but very firm. Just now they are out of stock, and I wish they would stock not just these but also the 1/4 inch thick version.</li>
            <li> They do not stick well at all.</li>
            <li> Several previous reviewers complained that the adhesive is not adequate and that the pad needs to be replaced after one or two days. I was very surprised to find that the pad can be removed before a shower and reapplied after the foot is dry. I have been able to get a week or more of use from a single pad when I remember to remove it before stepping into the shower. It would be great if the pad could remind me to take it off before each shower ;-)</li>
            <li> These are used by my 50 something wife. She is a runner. These pads are really a great product.  They stay in place winter or summer, wet or dry(including sweat).  Provides cushioning around the callus that has formed,from years of running, at the base of her 1st metatarsal.  Makes those loooong runs a lot more comfortable.  Once again. GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I love these metatarsal pads. After years of wearing heels I have no padding on the ball of my foot. These have saved my life</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this product. Very comforting-can be cut to size and stays in place all day. I will continue to order this product as needed because they are disposable after one use but still a great find.</li>
