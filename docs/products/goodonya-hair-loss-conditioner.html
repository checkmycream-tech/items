            <li>In case you&#x27;re looking for a good coconut oil to try, I was thrilled to recently discover the 5* rated (with an impressive 490 reviews) &amp;#34;Organic Fractionated Coconut Oil 16 oz.</li>

            <li>I like it better than Living Proof.</li>
            <li>I know who uses these also love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ideal way I&#x27;ve discovered to work with oil I use to add to my hair or to moisturize my skin is to use an old Acure glass bottle dispenser that their oils &amp; serums come in.  </li>

            <li>This is actually a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>It works better than most &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li>This conditioner &amp; their shampoo by the same name both have a lovely slight scent of almonds &amp; both products are always wonderful to use &amp; leave my hair wonderfully moisturized &amp; soft &amp; silky &amp; behaving beautifully</li>
            <li>I think this product is fine.  </li>
            <li>The best way to go (in my humble opinion) is to avoid both silicones and sulfates.</li>
            <li>If for some reason my understanding of the ingredient list is incorrect, I would love to know because other than that one thing, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very convenient different type of pump top that dispenses the ideal amount &amp; somehow is much easier to work with including because of the size of the bottle fitting easily into one&#x27;s hand.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;&amp; for a super rich &amp; extra great conditioner, &amp;#34;Pure Hair Solution Argan Oil Moisturizing Conditioner</li>

            <li>This is a gentle conditioner that works nicely and gently on my hair.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for 5 min after shampoo, and it rinses easily and leaves my hair easy to comb, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ &amp;#34;Silk 18 conditioner&amp;#34; by Maple Holistics which currently sells for $13.95 with free shipping &amp; is also wonderful to use &amp; leaves my hair extra silky soft.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft, smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li>This is really more designed for seriously damaged hair or at best to use as a monthly deep cleaning/conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>FORTUNATELY THERE ARE 3 OTHER GREAT NATURAL CONDITIONERS THAT WORK MUCH BETTER including in deep moisturizing &amp; leaving hair looking &amp; feeling great &amp; using beneficial ingredients &amp; FOR MUCH LESS COST i.e.:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner is awesome, it left my hair soft and silky with only one use.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a problem solved!</li>
            <li>The product will leave your hair feeling smooth, but like all conditioners containing Dimethicone, a silicone-based oil, it&#x27;s not 100% natural nor organic.</li>
            <li>I have bought this a 3rd time and truly love the product.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I shared those with my friend and it&#x27;s on her list of things to get next!:-)</li>
            <li>I did appreciate the company&#x27;s refund guarantee making it easy to get my money back but was so disappointed in this conditioner given the many rave reviews &amp; wonderful sounding ingredients.</li>
            <li>All Natural Organic, Support Healthy Hair Growth&amp;#34; which currently sells for $10.97 would be my top choice if the natural essential oils fragrance (given no fragrance listed in the ingredients) wasn&#x27;t so strong.</li>
            <li>strong when in use despite my usually only using fragrance-free products given chemical sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and this shampoo and conditioner is great for my hair.</li>
            <li>That makes it super easy to keep getting more oil as needed even when one already has wet or oily hands that can make oil bottles so slippery or hard to use.thorization or knowledge went in &amp; changed both the tile &amp; the content to just say &amp;</li>

            <li>I know the price may turn you off to this product, but a little does go a long way and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>; which Amazon currently sells for $9.71 but can be found a lot cheaper on many other websites.</li>
            <li>so I imagine it will last a long time, making it a very economical choice.</li>
            <li>The deep conditioner is fantastic, but I wouldn&#x27;t be buying it again due to its high price.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair feel soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not harsh on my hair color either.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair feel really soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>Amazon is looking into how this could have been possible &amp; in the meantime recommended that I delete that other review &amp; re-post my original review which I am now doing on 14-May-2015.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase it again personally, but enjoyed trying it.</li>
            <li>I spend an insane amount of money on hair care products and by far, this is the best conditioner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately though it works wonderfully as a deep conditioning treatment by simply rubbing it into my dry hair &amp; leaving it on for 5-15 minutes prior to shampooing which then only leaves a slight fragrance in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I usually use gobs of conditioner to really get the product on each of my hair and leave it on for 5 min., but with this, I use a quarter sized amount and it&#x27;s enough to work through my hair.</li>

            <li> It also goes a long way, I have long hair and usually have to use twice as much conditioner as I do shampoo to condition my hair but not with this product.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle worker on my very dry, processed long hair.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry figuring to use the curling brush on it once it was dry and voila,!</li>
            <li> my hair looked like I had already styled it by the time it was dry!</li>
            <li> but I actually prefer how this dispenses through the cap as oil can be so messy when pumped out as I found when I previously bought a different coconut oil that came with a pump.  </li>

            <li> Product feels great on the hair.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best ever.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 62 &amp; my hair is fairly long &amp; has a bit of the frizz thing going on.&lt;br /&gt;We also have well water but when I use this I can actually comb my wet hair with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I get quite a few compliments about my hair.&lt;br /&gt;To me this company has a miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the amount you get.&lt;br /&gt;I try to use it sparingly.(then recycle)!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this whenever I can afford it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair feel soft and silky.  My husband commented on the shine, too.</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner is fantastic, but I wouldn&#x27;t be buying it again due to its high price.</li>
            <li> Trying to stay away from sulfates.  My hair is thinning terribly and working hard to grow it back.  My hairdresser told me how harmful sulfates were for the hair.  I started out with Nioxin and continued with their other products but replaced both my shampoo and conditioner with this.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Leaves my hair so nice and it&#x27;s not harsh on my hair color either.</li>
            <li> I spend an insane amount of money on hair care products and by far, this is the best conditioner I have ever used.  It&#x27;s a miracle worker on my very dry, processed long hair.  I like it better than Living Proof.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with the frizzy hair left over from a bad perm. My son advised me to try this conditioner and I was delighted with the frizz control this product gave me! I let my hair air dry figuring to use the curling brush on it once it was dry and voila,! my hair looked like I had already styled it by the time it was dry! I can&#x27;t say everyone will have this same experience but I wanted to share mine with you. Thanks for a problem solved!</li>
            <li> The product will leave your hair feeling smooth, but like all conditioners containing Dimethicone, a silicone-based oil, it&#x27;s not 100% natural nor organic. I felt their marketing was misleading. The company said as of mid-March 2015 that they are reformulating the product and expect it to be Dimethicone-free in six weeks.</li>
            <li> I did appreciate the company&#x27;s refund guarantee making it easy to get my money back but was so disappointed in this conditioner given the many rave reviews &amp; wonderful sounding ingredients. FORTUNATELY THERE ARE 3 OTHER GREAT NATURAL CONDITIONERS THAT WORK MUCH BETTER including in deep moisturizing &amp; leaving hair looking &amp; feeling great &amp; using beneficial ingredients &amp; FOR MUCH LESS COST i.e.:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Acure Organics Conditioner Moroccan Argan Oil and Argan Stem Cell&amp;#34; which Amazon currently sells for $9.71 but can be found a lot cheaper on many other websites. This conditioner &amp; their shampoo by the same name both have a lovely slight scent of almonds &amp; both products are always wonderful to use &amp; leave my hair wonderfully moisturized &amp; soft &amp; silky &amp; behaving beautifully &amp; everybody else I know who uses these also love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ &amp;#34;Silk 18 conditioner&amp;#34; by Maple Holistics which currently sells for $13.95 with free shipping &amp; is also wonderful to use &amp; leaves my hair extra silky soft. This conditioner lists &amp;#34;natural vanilla fragrance&amp;#34; in its ingredients but it does not leave a lingering scent in my hair &amp; the scent feels pleasant &amp; not &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; strong when in use despite my usually only using fragrance-free products given chemical sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp; for a super rich &amp; extra great conditioner, &amp;#34;Pure Hair Solution Argan Oil Moisturizing Conditioner 8oz (237ml) -Hair Loss Prevention All Natural Organic, Support Healthy Hair Growth&amp;#34; which currently sells for $10.97 would be my top choice if the natural essential oils fragrance (given no fragrance listed in the ingredients) wasn&#x27;t so strong. Fortunately though it works wonderfully as a deep conditioning treatment by simply rubbing it into my dry hair &amp; leaving it on for 5-15 minutes prior to shampooing which then only leaves a slight fragrance in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Note: I originally posted this review on 2-Feb-2015 but somehow in the meantime somebody without my authorization or knowledge went in &amp; changed both the tile &amp; the content to just say &amp;#34;This is bad!&amp;#34;.  Amazon is looking into how this could have been possible &amp; in the meantime recommended that I delete that other review &amp; re-post my original review which I am now doing on 14-May-2015.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/16/15 UPDATE:  I have since discovered fractionated coconut oil which keeps the oil always liquid &amp; with no fragrance or stickiness unlike regular coconut oil.  If I add some to any conditioner I use, it makes my hair so wonderfully silky &amp; moisturised &amp; healthy that is awesome.  In case you&#x27;re looking for a good coconut oil to try, I was thrilled to recently discover the 5* rated (with an impressive 490 reviews) &amp;#34;Organic Fractionated Coconut Oil 16 oz. Premium Coconut Carrier Oil for Massage, Essential Oils and Aromatherapy. 100% Money Back Guarantee by Rocky Mountain Essentials&amp;#34; currently selling for $9.99 which seems like a great deal given many non-organic options selling for much more than that.  It&#x27;s the one I switched to because I prefer to avoid exposure to pesticides as much as possible.  It does not come with a pump but I actually prefer how this dispenses through the cap as oil can be so messy when pumped out as I found when I previously bought a different coconut oil that came with a pump.  The ideal way I&#x27;ve discovered to work with oil I use to add to my hair or to moisturize my skin is to use an old Acure glass bottle dispenser that their oils &amp; serums come in.  It&#x27;s a very convenient different type of pump top that dispenses the ideal amount &amp; somehow is much easier to work with including because of the size of the bottle fitting easily into one&#x27;s hand.  That makes it super easy to keep getting more oil as needed even when one already has wet or oily hands that can make oil bottles so slippery or hard to use.thorization or knowledge went in &amp; changed both the tile &amp; the content to just say &amp;#34;This is bad!&amp;#34;.

            <li> I have bought this a 3rd time and truly love the product. I have thin hair and this shampoo and conditioner is great for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is actually a fantastic product!  It did leave my hair very soft and silky feeling and I loved the scent as well. I personally won&#x27;t purchase it again though... This is really more designed for seriously damaged hair or at best to use as a monthly deep cleaning/conditioning treatment. I used both the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long and chemically processed (color/highlights) but not damaged. In the future I plan to use this after visits to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount of this product so I imagine it will last a long time, making it a very economical choice. It works better than most &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever bought.  Works great!  Keeps hair smooth and soft.  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> Great  conditioner!! Hair feels soft, smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel really soft and conditioned. However, I didn&#x27;t fully read the ingredient list before buying and it has silicone (Dimethicone) that is not water soluble. I am bringing it up since the company makes a point to state that they are &amp;#34;sulfate free.&amp;#34; Unfortunately, that is only half of it. Sulfates are needed to break down and wash off silicones which can smooth the hair shaft but if not removed can coat the shaft and  ultimately dry hair out worse. The best way to go (in my humble opinion) is to avoid both silicones and sulfates. I am super bummed that this is not &#x27;cone free. Won&#x27;t repurchase. If for some reason my understanding of the ingredient list is incorrect, I would love to know because other than that one thing, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I think this product is fine.  It is recommended to use twice a week to deep condition; I personally needed it daily.  I have found Matrix Repair to be just a good - if not better - at conditioning my hair and it is much less expensive, but I realize that this product focuses on being organic and natural.  I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase it again personally, but enjoyed trying it.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This conditioner is awesome, it left my hair soft and silky with only one use. It also goes a long way, I have long hair and usually have to use twice as much conditioner as I do shampoo to condition my hair but not with this product. I will be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> I know the price may turn you off to this product, but a little does go a long way and you&#x27;ll love it! My damaged hair feels healthy again!!!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this conditioner and I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I already see a difference in my hair! My question is can it be use as a leave in conditioner or do you have to wash it out?</li>
            <li> This is a gentle conditioner that works nicely and gently on my hair. They say it&#x27;s concentrated, so a little goes a long way. I usually use gobs of conditioner to really get the product on each of my hair and leave it on for 5 min., but with this, I use a quarter sized amount and it&#x27;s enough to work through my hair. I leave it on for 5 min after shampoo, and it rinses easily and leaves my hair easy to comb, shiny and soft. It came well packaged and in a timely manner with samples! I shared those with my friend and it&#x27;s on her list of things to get next!:-)</li>
            <li> Excellent intense conditioner! A little goes a long way!</li>
