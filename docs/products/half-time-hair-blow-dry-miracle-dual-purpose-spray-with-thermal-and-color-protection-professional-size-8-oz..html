            <li>I also used it on my hair &amp; It made drying so fast &amp; easy.</li>
            <li>&gt; Definitely ordering more!</li>
            <li>It is a GREAT product especially for us busy women.  </li>
            <li>Now...I can do my hair right before I need to get on the road.</li>

            <li>Also I have fine hair and some products either weigh it down or make it have lots of static</li>

            <li>I love it.. will definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I used it on towel dried hair this morning and was very impressed by how quickly my hair dried.  </li>
            <li>As someone with long thick hair, this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>love that I can blow dry my hair so fast and use as detangler and thermal protectant</li>
            <li>Not only does it significantly reduce the time it takes me to blow dry my hair, it also makes my hair smell amazing and makes it incredibly soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I use daily before styling and then spritz it on during the day to either smooth out or scrunch up my locks.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to save some time while getting ready.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be dry and stiff but it was soft, smelled good and looked amazing - like a professional blow out.</li>
            <li>Great product for long thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Actually, now I can do my hair right before going out to any event.</li>
            <li>I bought &amp; used this product on my daughter&#x27;s long hair &amp; it shortened the dry time significantly &amp; made brushing &amp; styling so easy because there were NO tangles throughout the entire process.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>In hindsight, I should have contacted them first prior to posting my review.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old was so happy to not have any tangles while I was drying her hair that I will keep purchasing Half Time Blow Dry Miracle as long as they make it.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, curly hair that I have to diffuse daily, (and I never allow enough time to dry it all the way).  </li>
            <li>but it does your leave hair soft</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair so soft and</li>
            <li>This product truely cuts down drying time.</li>
            <li>It definitely cuts down your blow dry time in half and leaves your hair in great condition.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic and you can use it on wet or dry hair to protect from any damaging heat device that you use.</li>
            <li>Half Time also works as a detangler on her long fine hair.  </li>
            <li>hair dry very quickly but leaves hair stiff</li>
            <li>long, short, curly or straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sticking with My Amazing Blow Dry Secret.</li>
            <li>It worked in half time and it kept my curly hair nice and fluffy with no frizz!!</li>
            <li>It really DOES cut down the time on heat drying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No with Half time Blow Dry Miracle, I can wash and dry my hair more often and at half the time.</li>
            <li>The smell of it was bad in my opinion, and I don&#x27;t feel that it made my hair feel as good as a comparable product does.</li>

            <li> highly recommend Half Time for all hair types:</li>
            <li> middle school daughter uses it to speed up the blow drying process and as a thermal sealer for flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> I was sceptical that this would work with my long, curly, coarse, blonde hair</li>
            <li> It took about a third of the time..not long enough for my wrist to hurt.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for any hair style &amp; especially for long hair styles and young girl&#x27;s hair due to the detangler.</li>
            <li> Surely this is a bad batch or something because unlike the &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; scent described by other reviewers it smelled very metallic, like iron.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair every 4 days or so because it takes so long to dry.</li>
            <li> With Half Time, I really do cut my blow drying in half</li>
            <li> but I am shocked to say my hair felt AMAZING after</li>
            <li> WHY would it have to take that long?  </li>
            <li> Living in Florida and having long hair is a challenge.</li>
            <li> Used to be, in order to get to work on time in the morning because I have long hair I would wash and blow dry the night before.</li>
            <li> I NEVER blow dry.</li>
            <li> Does it help your hair dry any faster, no</li>
            <li> Literally 1/2 time the dry time</li>
            <li> I am usually not one to leave a negative review</li>
            <li> Dry time was definitely cut in half if not more.</li>
            <li> Usually my wrist starts to hurt from how long it takes to blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use Half Time Hair on wet or dry hair to keep down the frizz in the SW Florida heat and humidity (as I type this our forecast today</li>
            <li> After my review, the company emailed me stating that they were replacing my bottle and confirmed it must have been a bad bottle possibly due to heat exposure during shipping.</li>
            <li> and it did not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida, with the heat and humidity, it can be very frustrating spending so much time with the blow dryer and straightener before work.</li>
            <li> It cut my blow drying time in half.  </li>
            <li> We use Half Time Hair two ways in our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Half Time all the time.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Half Time helps me deliver on this.</li>
            <li> I have long  thick hair and used it generously</li>
            <li> I used the spray on my towel dried hair and then dried with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Thank you Half Time Hair!</li>
            <li> It truly cut the time way less than usual!  </li>
            <li> No more ponytail days no more excuses for not blow drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this stuff is amazing!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> After reading all the rave reviews, I was pretty disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I have thick hair that loves to hold water.</li>
            <li> As far as how it works, I can&#x27;t say because the scent was too awful to spray all over.</li>
            <li> Sorry, this is my opinion...</li>
            <li> maybe it was a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff smells horrible.</li>

            <li> I love this product! Living in Florida, with the heat and humidity, it can be very frustrating spending so much time with the blow dryer and straightener before work. This spray really helps keep your hair healthy and shiny throughout the day. The best part is no frizz! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very cool product! I tried it on my dry hair and it gave a beautiful shine and softness. I will be using it regularly!</li>
            <li> Today I tried this product for the first time and I am hooked.  It cut my blow drying time in half.  It is a GREAT product especially for us busy women.  No more ponytail days no more excuses for not blow drying my hair.  Thank you for creating such a great product.  I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> What a great idea! As someone with long thick hair, this product is perfect. I used the spray on my towel dried hair and then dried with a blow dryer. Dry time was definitely cut in half if not more. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Great Product!! It definitely cuts down your blow dry time in half and leaves your hair in great condition. I have long  thick hair and used it generously and it did not weigh my hair down. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> We use Half Time Hair two ways in our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My middle school daughter uses it to speed up the blow drying process and as a thermal sealer for flat ironing.  (At this age, she is &#x27;all about her hair.&#x27;)  Half Time also works as a detangler on her long fine hair.  Even if she air drys, we still use it to smooth out the frizz and seal before ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shorter, curly hair... I NEVER blow dry. (I&#x27;d have an afro if I did.)  I use Half Time Hair on wet or dry hair to keep down the frizz in the SW Florida heat and humidity (as I type this our forecast today is 90 degrees and 98% humidity.)  I no longer worry about walking out the door of my A/C home and having my hair go bananas from the southern climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Half Time for all hair types: long, short, curly or straight. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical that this would work with my long, curly, coarse, blonde hair but I am shocked to say my hair felt AMAZING after and I think, but not 100% sure, the drying time was reducted.  I expected it to be dry and stiff but it was soft, smelled good and looked amazing - like a professional blow out.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This is awesome!  It truly cut the time way less than usual!  Usually my wrist starts to hurt from how long it takes to blow dry my hair.  It took about a third of the time..not long enough for my wrist to hurt. yay!  I love it.. will definitely buy again.  And what a great price :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt; Definitely ordering more! My hair feels so smooth &amp; healthy.&lt;br /&gt;FANTASTIC PRODUCT and a GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> Great product for long thick hair.  Worked just as described.  I used it on towel dried hair this morning and was very impressed by how quickly my hair dried.  I can&#x27;t wait to show it to my stylist, she&#x27;s going to love it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have very fine, curly hair that I have to diffuse daily, (and I never allow enough time to dry it all the way).  This product helps me get out the door faster without the frizziness.  Oh by the way, it is a great detangler too!</li>
            <li> Even if you had all day to blow-dry your hair...  WHY would it have to take that long?  This product is fantastic and you can use it on wet or dry hair to protect from any damaging heat device that you use. You will not be disappointed.  5 stars!! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> ****Update: People compliment the scent of my hair and my hair seemed to stay fresher between washes. Thanks! ****Update:  After my review, the company emailed me stating that they were replacing my bottle and confirmed it must have been a bad bottle possibly due to heat exposure during shipping. I am surprised and very pleased by the customer service. In hindsight, I should have contacted them first prior to posting my review. I will be happy to receive the new bottle and update my review after I try it! Until then customer service deserves 5 stars!!  I am usually not one to leave a negative review but this stuff smells horrible. Surely this is a bad batch or something because unlike the &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; scent described by other reviewers it smelled very metallic, like iron. My husband described it the same way after smelling my hair. As far as how it works, I can&#x27;t say because the scent was too awful to spray all over. Sorry, this is my opinion...maybe it was a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> I use Half Time all the time.&lt;br /&gt;My naturally wavy hair and my lifestyle call for easy and quick ways to wear my hair both very straight and with a lot of volume. Half Time helps me deliver on this. I use daily before styling and then spritz it on during the day to either smooth out or scrunch up my locks. Very versatile. So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> What a great tool for my hair; I wish I had this years ago.  With Half Time, I really do cut my blow drying in half and it comes out shiny and beautiful! Great idea just in time for the humidity that is fast approaching this summer :-) Thank you Half Time Hair!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Does it help your hair dry any faster, no but it does your leave hair soft</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I have thick hair that loves to hold water. This product truely cuts down drying time. Also works great protecting my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Not only does it significantly reduce the time it takes me to blow dry my hair, it also makes my hair smell amazing and makes it incredibly soft and shiny! I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to save some time while getting ready.</li>
            <li> love that I can blow dry my hair so fast and use as detangler and thermal protectant</li>
            <li> Living in Florida and having long hair is a challenge. I only wash my hair every 4 days or so because it takes so long to dry. No with Half time Blow Dry Miracle, I can wash and dry my hair more often and at half the time. Thank you so much for this product, I love it!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Literally 1/2 time the dry time and it makes my hair so soft and it protects it from heat...What!!!! It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!!! Smells awesome and cut my dry time in half. Also I have fine hair and some products either weigh it down or make it have lots of static and this product did neither!! Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This product was amazing!!! It worked in half time and it kept my curly hair nice and fluffy with no frizz!!</li>
            <li> I bought &amp; used this product on my daughter&#x27;s long hair &amp; it shortened the dry time significantly &amp; made brushing &amp; styling so easy because there were NO tangles throughout the entire process. My 9 year old was so happy to not have any tangles while I was drying her hair that I will keep purchasing Half Time Blow Dry Miracle as long as they make it. I also used it on my hair &amp; It made drying so fast &amp; easy. GREAT PRODUCT!  I recommend it for any hair style &amp; especially for long hair styles and young girl&#x27;s hair due to the detangler.</li>
            <li> hair dry very quickly but leaves hair stiff</li>
            <li> After reading all the rave reviews, I was pretty disappointed in this product. The smell of it was bad in my opinion, and I don&#x27;t feel that it made my hair feel as good as a comparable product does. I&#x27;ll be sticking with My Amazing Blow Dry Secret.</li>
            <li> MAGIC***** There must be magic in this bottle! How often can you declare that a beauty product has changed your life? Well try this wonderful little miracle in a bottle. Used to be, in order to get to work on time in the morning because I have long hair I would wash and blow dry the night before. Now...I can do my hair right before I need to get on the road. Actually, now I can do my hair right before going out to any event. This makes my hair soft, shiny, beautiful. It really DOES cut down the time on heat drying.&lt;br /&gt;I have started bringing this to my stylist when I get my hair done at the salon and let me tell you how happy that makes us all - a much shorter time in the chair for my cut and blow dry!&lt;br /&gt;My advice- buy one for yourself and give a bottle to your friends, they will love you for it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  My hair is so shiny and healthy looking!</li>
