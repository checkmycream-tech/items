            <li>This is exactly as pictured, and works great.</li>
            <li>This organizer turned out to be much more spacious than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I had one of these am/pm pill containers for many years when one of the flaps broke off.  </li>
            <li>Weekly Pill Organaizer in 2009 and was satisfied with the quality of the product that lasted until this year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would be best for larger pills.  </li>
            <li>I had one of these am/pm pill containers for many years when one of the flaps broke off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for elderly and disabled persons, as it opens very easily.</li>
            <li>The top could fit a wee bit tighter.</li>
            <li>Easy to snap and unsnap</li>
            <li>Pulling out the tops makes it easy to refill.</li>
            <li>Return was easy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to load and retrieve the pills.</li>
            <li>Product as indicated and suits my needs just fine.</li>

            <li>product is well made and easy to clean.</li>

            <li>Loading is incredibly easy because the tabs all lift out and you can drop the pills in quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect if you only take pills twice a day and has easy open bays too.</li>
            <li>I emailed the seller, they sent me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>I like this particular container because it is a decently compact size and still holds many pills in each section.</li>

            <li>I had originally ordered another brand, but it was too small, this Apex one is the perfect size for multiple large vitamins.  </li>
            <li>In spite of these preferences, I like the organizer very much.</li>
            <li>This works fine as long as you leave it in a secure spot, I accidentally dropped it and pills went everywhere.  </li>
            <li>The individual lids flip up easily for quick access to the days meds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This takes quite a few pills and works great so far!  </li>
            <li>Okay if you take a lot of pills or several large ones, but found it too large for my needs.</li>
            <li>Nice little device.</li>
            <li>Very helpful and response.</li>
            <li>The patients will find them to be very helpful.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>Weekly Pill Organaizer and I was very disapponted as the design was modified but not to the better.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Item as described fast shipping</li>
            <li>is a great pill keeper but definitely not for use in a house hold with small children.</li>
            <li>which is good if you have shaky hands.</li>
            <li>This is handy, small, and constructed well organizer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a twice-a-day pill organizer.  </li>
            <li>Pills fit in well, just had to be careful with those elastics.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another good thing is, when the item arrives, one cap was broken.</li>
            <li>It seems so many of the other pill reminders are larger than this one.  </li>
            <li>It seems so many of the other pill reminders are larger than this one.</li>
            <li>Not much to say here -- it does what it says, is easy to use, and keeps my daily pills organized.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a daily AM and PM pill organizer I highly suggest you try this one!</li>
            <li>I had been looking for this specific pill organizer forever, it&#x27;s the exact same one I&#x27;ve had for years</li>
            <li>I will admit that a major of users will be using it in their homes and will probably get about 50 to 100 uses before the plastic hinge breaks off.  </li>
            <li>Returned due to large size.</li>

            <li> Well... the hinge on the covers won&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li> Since items in a hand bag tend to rub against each other, several days of pills fell out.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, because other than that I really liked this pill case.</li>
            <li> My only issues with it are slight, but matter.</li>
            <li> Other than that, everything is good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other says Sun.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, at the end of the first week, I took off the covers to refill and they were just sitting on my bed.  </li>
            <li> The new box integrity is rather poor.</li>
            <li> Solution was a heavy elastic band around each side, to be removed carefully morning and night.  </li>
            <li> My father likes it -- it is a little bit too big, not very good for travelling.</li>
            <li> one of the dates does not latch tightly.</li>
            <li> The lids on both sides can be easily removed from the base for filling or cleaning.</li>
            <li> the plastic latch is rather weak and if you shake the pill box some of the covers pop open and your pills spill all over the place.</li>
            <li> They got buried underneath a few pillows, and it must have bent backward or something, and when I picked it up, Saturday was broken off.  </li>
            <li> It was under pillows, so obviously not a very heavy object or rough treatment, so the durability is awful.  </li>
            <li> PM door was broken.</li>

            <li> Works great.  Been using it for years now.</li>
            <li> When the pill organizer arrived both packages were defective.  No time to ask for a refund/replacement as I was headed on a trip.  On both the Sat. PM door was broken.</li>
            <li> Okay if you take a lot of pills or several large ones, but found it too large for my needs.</li>
            <li> Well... the hinge on the covers won&#x27;t last too long.  I will admit that a major of users will be using it in their homes and will probably get about 50 to 100 uses before the plastic hinge breaks off.  I packed it in my suitcase and by the time I got to my distination, two covers already broke off.  I tried to pack it tighter, on my return, but another door fell off.  I had to throw it away once I returned.</li>
            <li> So now I feel like a Big Boy who doesn&#x27;t forget which pills to take and when to take them.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this specific pill organizer forever, it&#x27;s the exact same one I&#x27;ve had for years so I knew it would last.  I frequently travel and it fits perfectly in my carry-on bag.  If you&#x27;re looking for a daily AM and PM pill organizer I highly suggest you try this one!</li>
            <li> My father likes it -- it is a little bit too big, not very good for travelling. Other than that, everything is good.&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing is, when the item arrives, one cap was broken. I emailed the seller, they sent me a replacement right away. Very helpful and response.</li>
            <li> Good product and is very useful for what we purchased it for.  The patients will find them to be very helpful.</li>
            <li> This is exactly as pictured, and works great. It&#x27;s perfect for elderly and disabled persons, as it opens very easily. I would definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> This organizer turned out to be much more spacious than I thought it would be. It is perfect if you only take pills twice a day and has easy open bays too.</li>
            <li> Unless treated with great care, this pill organizer pops open.  Since items in a hand bag tend to rub against each other, several days of pills fell out.  Solution was a heavy elastic band around each side, to be removed carefully morning and night.  I used three organizers, got me through 3 weeks in Africa.  Pills fit in well, just had to be careful with those elastics.</li>
            <li> This works fine as long as you leave it in a secure spot, I accidentally dropped it and pills went everywhere.  It does keep you organized though.</li>
            <li> Product as indicated and suits my needs just fine. Delivery prompt too. Would deal with this supplier again.</li>
            <li> This takes quite a few pills and works great so far!  Easy to snap and unsnap which is good if you have shaky hands.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and it serves its purpose.  one of the dates does not latch tightly.</li>
            <li> I have two routines for medications, one in the morning and one in the evening. This is handy, small, and constructed well organizer. Pulling out the tops makes it easy to refill. My only issues with it are slight, but matter. The top could fit a wee bit tighter. And I wish the labels of the days ran the same. When looking at it, one side says Sat. through Sun. The other says Sun. through Sat. They could run the same or put both so they not only read the same but read the same without turning it. In spite of these preferences, I like the organizer very much.</li>
            <li> I had one of these am/pm pill containers for many years when one of the flaps broke off.  It seems so many of the other pill reminders are larger than this one.  I like this particular container because it is a decently compact size and still holds many pills in each section.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Apex Twice a day Weekly Pill Organaizer in 2009 and was satisfied with the quality of the product that lasted until this year.&lt;br /&gt;I just repurchased the Apex Twice a day Weekly Pill Organaizer and I was very disapponted as the design was modified but not to the better.&lt;br /&gt;When you close a pill bin the plastic latch is rather weak and if you shake the pill box some of the covers pop open and your pills spill all over the place. The new box integrity is rather poor.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here -- it does what it says, is easy to use, and keeps my daily pills organized.  I bought a second one to have a 2-week pill supply set up.  Loading is incredibly easy because the tabs all lift out and you can drop the pills in quickly.  Gelatine pills (like omega-3) tend to stick a bit, but they will stick to anything.  Nice little device.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a simple pill box with night and day pill division.  I have no issues with this one.</li>
            <li> Item as described fast shipping</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a twice-a-day pill organizer.  I had originally ordered another brand, but it was too small, this Apex one is the perfect size for multiple large vitamins.  It&#x27;s attractive and well made.</li>
            <li> Very handy for pill users.</li>
            <li> Very nice pill keeper for AM &amp; PM meds. The lids on both sides can be easily removed from the base for filling or cleaning. The individual lids flip up easily for quick access to the days meds.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great pill keeper but definitely not for use in a house hold with small children.</li>
            <li> Returned due to large size. Would be best for larger pills.  Return was easy. Did find a smaller size at a local grocery store.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but the labeling was incorrect.  It should have been labeled AM and PM.&lt;br /&gt;Mine was labeled AM and Am.&lt;br /&gt;The product is well made and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I had one of these am/pm pill containers for many years when one of the flaps broke off. It seems so many of the other pill reminders are larger than this one. I like this particular container because it is a decently compact size and still holds many pills in each section.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can remove the covers.  It makes it a lot easier to fill the pill case.  Unfortunately, at the end of the first week, I took off the covers to refill and they were just sitting on my bed.  They got buried underneath a few pillows, and it must have bent backward or something, and when I picked it up, Saturday was broken off.  It was under pillows, so obviously not a very heavy object or rough treatment, so the durability is awful.  Too bad, because other than that I really liked this pill case.</li>
            <li> Got it for my supplements and  they all fit. I fill it up for 2 weeks so it is also good for traveling. It is easy to load and retrieve the pills.</li>
