            <li>I&#x27;m trying to remove a permatan and this is working great!  </li>
            <li>and I am sooooo happy I decided to try it!</li>
            <li>.it&#x27;s been about 2 hours since I did my peel and honestly, and I can&#x27;t stop looking at my face!!!.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed, I do believe I&#x27;ve found my pot of gold.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>lol will order again</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and have had great results with this.</li>
            <li>So I figured if the 20% worked so great  </li>
            <li>I also mix it in with my moisturing lotion it that works great to.</li>
            <li>Good peel.</li>
            <li>and I have always taken really good care of my skin, as a result</li>
            <li>so i can&#x27;t handle more than 4-5 minutes, but this works good!</li>
            <li>I love the results!  </li>
            <li>I am so completely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>This is strong stuff - follow directions for exposure time!</li>
            <li>It worked great on my face like I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li>I just finished my 3rd peel today, and I have to say that this stuff is great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be doing this 1 more time before doing a 2 week resting period...</li>
            <li>n much better to me .</li>
            <li>is really more.</li>
            <li>I do love it, but I cannot use it, since I am lactose intolerant.</li>
            <li>But considering my age, I thought the lactic acid peel maybe better suited to my needs.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a very nice, gentle moisturizer to use afterwards.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>The 40% is strong too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>but it was totally fine</li>
            <li>Best results I use for skin conditions are variety acne &amp; scar, firm face &amp; neck, enlarged pores, removes toxin etc.</li>
            <li>Make sure you invest in a good sunblock while using this because your skin is pretty sensitive after a peel.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when i received this in the mail, it came on the day it said it would.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this product, so</li>
            <li>and then some rubbing alcohol on it to clean off any oil on my hands.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I had high hopes for this product after reading the numerous wonderful reviews raving about it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I really noticed any big difference like I experienced with the salicylic peel.  </li>
            <li>I still would highly advise going to an esthetician or dermatologist to make sure you are candidate for a chemical peel at all.</li>
            <li>I clean my hands off first with either a cotton pad soaked in witch hazel or a cotton pad dampened with water</li>
            <li>But i did decide to keep it and add a little water to dilute it to 20% and it worked just great.</li>
            <li>I could barely smile and it continued to sting for HOURS after the peel.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it, but take it easy.</li>
            <li>This company delivered on time and the price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li>and I have seen such a HUGE difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>The bottle will probably last me a year maybe two, but after that I would consider rebuying if it is still available (and I hope it is!).</li>
            <li>mine got burned because i left it on for more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I was pretty scared to try it at first with this being my first ever chemical peel</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>most people think I&#x27;m 38 not turning 50 next year.</li>
            <li>Okay so this is my second time ordering from this company.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought the lactic acid peel 20%</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting TCA and other glycolic peels for years and they have never been as effective at improving my acne scars or skin tone as lactic acid.</li>
            <li>It was pure AGONY</li>
            <li>I used this last week followed directions yes burned when I put baking soda on but was fine after</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really sting, but it does tingle and itch.  </li>
            <li>and it will fry your face and make you peel like no ones business if you use to much.</li>
            <li>The step-by-step instructions for a very conservative peel schedule was so helpful</li>
            <li>It burns, it really does.</li>
            <li>I started out with the salicylic peel, which worked really well.  </li>
            <li>, maybe this is the peel I really should have started with, as I really have never had acne, but did have a couple spots of hyperpigmentation on my cheek and chin.  </li>
            <li>My scars are almost completely gone!!!</li>
            <li>but i expected that :) i would recommend i cant wait to see what my skin looks like in another few weeks :)</li>
            <li>Immediately, I noticed minor scabs and a very large BURN MARK developing right before my eyes.</li>
            <li>but make sure you don&#x27;t over do it or you could burn your skin a little bit.</li>
            <li>His skin is getting somewhat smoother but will require quite a few more applications.</li>
            <li>The corners of my mouth turned ASH BLACK like charcoal and each hour that passed, the more burn marks developed.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than other \\&quot;dark spot treatments\\&quot; and probably works better!</li>
            <li>so I have to order a new one</li>
            <li>followed the instructions left it on 3 minutes since it was my first time, then neuturalized with baking soda/water .</li>
            <li>This stuff is different maybe because of it being pure I guess(??).</li>
            <li>my skin around my mouth looked clear</li>
            <li>and when i woke up in the morning they were completely flattened.</li>
            <li>, i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and it is NOT for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It was very clear that this product BURNED MY FACE RAW and lactic acid is supposed to be mild.</li>
            <li>I got nervous and only left it on for 3 minutes with my baking soda ready to neutralize.</li>
            <li>We only leave it on his skin for 6 minutes since he has very sensitive skin with some rosacea.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother and my hormonal breakouts have decreased significantly.</li>
            <li>Then I use a fan brush to swipe the &amp;#34;Lactic Acid Peel&amp;#34; on my hands and leave it on for about 8 to 8 and half minutes(time will vary with the individual--do a patch test first to determine the amount of time to leave on your skin).</li>
            <li>are just a little paler, hopefully after a few more treatments</li>
            <li>He made the mistake of rubbing his skin while washing it after a lactic acid application one of the first few times we did it and his facial skin was somewhat sore and irritated the next day.  </li>
            <li>This product is not MILD or GENTLE, it is like lighter fluid on your face.</li>

            <li> This product is not MILD or GENTLE, it is like lighter fluid on your face.</li>
            <li> This does lighten up my dark marks considerably.</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> I am 49 year old black woman</li>
            <li> I usually apply the peel with a new foundation brush and leave it on for the recommended amount of time according to the instructions then splash some water with baking soda in it to neutralize the acid, again like the instructions say.</li>
            <li> I put neosporine and other topical creams to help my face</li>
            <li> While it does a decent exfoliation of the skin, I am not sure I would recommend it to the average person.</li>
            <li> The slight stinging is totally tolerable and assures me the product is working.  </li>
            <li> This is runny like water, so careful it doesn&#x27;t go where you don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> but what I know is that this stuff does not get weaker in time unlike other peels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I followed ALL instructions very very carefully and prepped my skin accordingly.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are peeling off now and underneath the spots</li>
            <li> I think this is a case were less</li>
            <li> When I had worked up to the 6 or 8 minute level I did experience some slight peeling, but it lasted about one day and was so slight that I don&#x27;t know anyone else noticed.  </li>
            <li> The acid does feel pretty uncomfortable when you are first getting used to it, kinda like a prickly feeling like you are brushing it on with needles but not too painful just not comfortable.</li>
            <li> That feeling goes away, however, after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It will take a few days until your skin starts peeling, don&#x27;t forget to use oils or moisturizers in the meantime.</li>
            <li> When I woke up and looked at the mirror, I literally burst into tears because my face was covered with burns, cuts, scabs, and it was raw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure either</li>
            <li> My skin has been the worst its ever been in my whole life, but this has definitely been helping a lot.</li>
            <li> Peels can be very dangerous when in the wrong hands or on certain skin types.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous to try this peel because I have had bad reactions in the past when using a glycolic peel.  </li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re actually very faint now.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> my skin looks alot clearer it hurt when i used it but i expected that :) i would recommend i cant wait to see what my skin looks like in another few weeks :)</li>
            <li> I just finished my 3rd peel today, and I have to say that this stuff is great!  I have not had one pimple since I started this.  I do this peel every Friday.  Though there is no downtime per say, my face still turns red for a couple days so that&#x27;s why I do it on a Friday.  I&#x27;m trying to remove a permatan and this is working great!  I&#x27;ll be doing this 1 more time before doing a 2 week resting period...but I&#x27;m thinking about going for 6 weeks, THEN taking the 2 week break.  It doesn&#x27;t really sting, but it does tingle and itch.  That feeling goes away, however, after a few minutes.  Make sure you invest in a good sunblock while using this because your skin is pretty sensitive after a peel.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I used this last week followed directions yes burned when I put baking soda on but was fine after and now it&#x27;s been a week my face broke out but that&#x27;s because all the impurities were coming out and I looked today my skin around my mouth looked clear n much better to me . I&#x27;m going to do my second one tonight but I did break my bottle so I have to order a new one lol will order again I suggest this</li>
            <li> Good peel. Works well for acne scars and pigmentation issues. Just remember that it IS a peel and it will fry your face and make you peel like no ones business if you use to much. I&#x27;ve been getting TCA and other glycolic peels for years and they have never been as effective at improving my acne scars or skin tone as lactic acid. i highly recommend it, but take it easy. I think this is a case were less is really more.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed esthetician and purchased this to use on myself. While it does a decent exfoliation of the skin, I am not sure I would recommend it to the average person. Peels can be very dangerous when in the wrong hands or on certain skin types. I still would highly advise going to an esthetician or dermatologist to make sure you are candidate for a chemical peel at all. All peels and skin types are VERY different....</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous to try this peel because I have had bad reactions in the past when using a glycolic peel.  I heard that lactic peels were easier to handle, so I gave this one a try.  The step-by-step instructions for a very conservative peel schedule was so helpful and I&#x27;m thankful they included this with the product.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m sure I would have gone about it all wrong.  I love the results!  The slight stinging is totally tolerable and assures me the product is working.  When I had worked up to the 6 or 8 minute level I did experience some slight peeling, but it lasted about one day and was so slight that I don&#x27;t know anyone else noticed.  This company delivered on time and the price is definitely right.  The bottle will probably last me a year maybe two, but after that I would consider rebuying if it is still available (and I hope it is!).</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i received this in the mail, it came on the day it said it would. This does lighten up my dark marks considerably. My skin has been the worst its ever been in my whole life, but this has definitely been helping a lot. I had 2 cystic pimples on my cheek, i left this on  for 5 minutes and when i woke up in the morning they were completely flattened. I wouldn&#x27;t say its a miracle, as i still do have a lot of scarring, but it is definitely helpful, and the parts of my skin that don&#x27;t have any scars always appear brighter and whiter the morning i wake up after doing a peel. but make sure you don&#x27;t over do it or you could burn your skin a little bit. mine got burned because i left it on for more than 5 minutes, i have sensitive skin so i can&#x27;t handle more than 4-5 minutes, but this works good! i&#x27;ll buy it again when i run out ^_^</li>
            <li> First of all, I had high hopes for this product after reading the numerous wonderful reviews raving about it. I was so excited to use this product, so when it was delivered, I got to business. I followed ALL instructions very very carefully and prepped my skin accordingly. I applied it with a fan brush as recommended (for even application) and it immediately started to burn like hell. I got nervous and only left it on for 3 minutes with my baking soda ready to neutralize. I felt like my face was melting off and when I doused the baking soda to neutralize, I felt pain like I have never felt before. I literally wailed, and my sister said that she never heard me make that noise before. It was pure AGONY but I continued because I knew I had to stop the process with the baking soda. Immediately, I noticed minor scabs and a very large BURN MARK developing right before my eyes. I could barely smile and it continued to sting for HOURS after the peel. The corners of my mouth turned ASH BLACK like charcoal and each hour that passed, the more burn marks developed. It was very clear that this product BURNED MY FACE RAW and lactic acid is supposed to be mild. I put neosporine and other topical creams to help my face and I went to sleep HOPING THIS NIGHTMARE WOULD BE OVER. When I woke up and looked at the mirror, I literally burst into tears because my face was covered with burns, cuts, scabs, and it was raw. My mouth, forehead, cheeks, and chin all burned and now I can&#x27;t leave the house until it heals a bit.    Long story short this product is NOT for everyone and it is NOT for people with sensitive skin. This product is not MILD or GENTLE, it is like lighter fluid on your face. So please think twice and take the utmost precautions. I got BURNED.</li>
            <li> This stuff is different maybe because of it being pure I guess(??). I&#x27;m not sure either but what I know is that this stuff does not get weaker in time unlike other peels I&#x27;ve used. You NEED to neutralise this with baking soda and rinse it off, don&#x27;t try to leave it on for longer than 5/10 minutes. It burns, it really does.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I both use this product.  I use a fan-brush and swipe it on the backs of my hands to help fade age spots.  I clean my hands off first with either a cotton pad soaked in witch hazel or a cotton pad dampened with water and then some rubbing alcohol on it to clean off any oil on my hands.  Then I use a fan brush to swipe the &amp;#34;Lactic Acid Peel&amp;#34; on my hands and leave it on for about 8 to 8 and half minutes(time will vary with the individual--do a patch test first to determine the amount of time to leave on your skin). I rinse it off with copious amounts of lukewarm water and then moisturize.  Yes, it does peel some for several days.  DON&#x27;T pick at the peeling, just keep things moisturized.  I only use the peel every 7 days  at the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying it to my husband&#x27;s face to help with mottling from sun damage. We only leave it on his skin for 6 minutes since he has very sensitive skin with some rosacea.  He rinses the lactic acid off in the shower and applies aloe vera gel afterward.  His skin is getting somewhat smoother but will require quite a few more applications. He made the mistake of rubbing his skin while washing it after a lactic acid application one of the first few times we did it and his facial skin was somewhat sore and irritated the next day.  So, now he just &amp;#34;rinses&amp;#34; off the lactic acid in the shower after applying it and hasn&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> Best results I use for skin conditions are variety acne &amp; scar, firm face &amp; neck, enlarged pores, removes toxin etc.</li>
            <li> This is strong stuff - follow directions for exposure time! This is runny like water, so careful it doesn&#x27;t go where you don&#x27;t want it. It will take a few days until your skin starts peeling, don&#x27;t forget to use oils or moisturizers in the meantime. My dark spots are peeling off now and underneath the spots are just a little paler, hopefully after a few more treatments they&#x27;re gone.</li>
            <li> I had been looking up how to get rid of post-acne marks when I heard about doing a peel and I decided to try this one. I am so completely satisfied with this product! It came very quickly and was packaged well. I usually apply the peel with a new foundation brush and leave it on for the recommended amount of time according to the instructions then splash some water with baking soda in it to neutralize the acid, again like the instructions say. I&#x27;ve done maybe 6 peels in 2 months time (I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it) and I have seen such a HUGE difference in my skin! My scars are almost completely gone!!! I&#x27;ve used exfoliators and things before but nothing works like this! The acid does feel pretty uncomfortable when you are first getting used to it, kinda like a prickly feeling like you are brushing it on with needles but not too painful just not comfortable. I was pretty scared to try it at first with this being my first ever chemical peel but it was totally fine and I am sooooo happy I decided to try it! So much cheaper than other \\&quot;dark spot treatments\\&quot; and probably works better! I would absolutely recommend this to everyone! Just make sure you have a very nice, gentle moisturizer to use afterwards.</li>
            <li> i didnt notice any difference however i only used it 4 times. id rather just stay out of the sunlight after using it than take a chance with sunblock not working and i cant seem to get the chance to stay out of the sun after using it</li>
            <li> I do love it, but I cannot use it, since I am lactose intolerant.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and have had great results with this. My skin feels much smoother and my hormonal breakouts have decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I am 49 year old black woman and I have always taken really good care of my skin, as a result most people think I&#x27;m 38 not turning 50 next year. I started using peels about 6 months now.  I started out with the salicylic peel, which worked really well.  Then I decided to try the glycolic peel and it worked so/so for me-- I can&#x27;t say I really noticed any big difference like I experienced with the salicylic peel.  Then I started reading that women of color recommended the lactic acid peel and thought \\&quot;hmm, maybe this is the peel I really should have started with, as I really have never had acne, but did have a couple spots of hyperpigmentation on my cheek and chin.  I must say, the salicylic peel did lighten those quite a bit, they&#x27;re actually very faint now.  But considering my age, I thought the lactic acid peel maybe better suited to my needs.  I received it, and decided to try today, followed the instructions left it on 3 minutes since it was my first time, then neuturalized with baking soda/water . .it&#x27;s been about 2 hours since I did my peel and honestly, and I can&#x27;t stop looking at my face!!!. . I&#x27;m glowing and my skin looks like velvet. . I&#x27;m really impressed, I do believe I&#x27;ve found my pot of gold.</li>
            <li> Okay so this is my second time ordering from this company. The first time I bought the lactic acid peel 20% and I used it once every 2 weeks and some times once a week. It worked great on my face like I saw results after the first use. My skin is about garbriel unions tone and I have lots of acnes scars. this stuff lightened my skin cleared up and stopped breakout and also faded my scars. So I figured if the 20% worked so great  the 40% would work even better WRONG. The 40% is strong too strong for my skin. But i did decide to keep it and add a little water to dilute it to 20% and it worked just great. So as a word of advice start low and work your way up to the 40%. I also mix it in with my moisturing lotion it that works great to.</li>
