            <li>The customer service was great on this product.  </li>
            <li>I would be bald without this stuff GREAT STUFF</li>
            <li>Tingling scalp and pleasant scent?</li>
            <li>good cleaning shampoo</li>
            <li>so I would consider this a good value.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Oh and sometimes I buy his stock at TJ Maxx at amazing prices.</li>
            <li>but I liked how it cleaned my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Glad to be using it again.</li>
            <li>I had a thyroid condition at the time and it made a real difference, for the good.</li>
            <li>The fine folks at Wella have seen fit to remove almost half of the 62 original ingredients.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more soon .</li>
            <li>Really does work!</li>
            <li>A quick internet search reveals the relatively high cost of some of these summarily deleted components.</li>
            <li>I have never had so much dandruff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make your hair grow, but these help in making hair look fuller.</li>
            <li>When  I told the company about the problem, they sent a replacement for what was lost and it was really packaged well this time.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been using this product for the last 5 years and she absolutely swears by it!!!</li>
            <li>She takes a lot of medications and started to notice her hair was shedding more than normal and becoming thin</li>
            <li>a former loyal Nioxin user and booster</li>
            <li>It made my scalp even more dried out/</li>
            <li>The product was delivered as expected and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Wella corporation is now selling us half the product for the same formerly justified price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because of the cost, it is hard to fine in my area.</li>
            <li>Cleans and conditions as expected for a price not as high as the high-end salon where I once purchased this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally, they HAVE added SODIUM-LAURYL-SULFATE,  apparently as a surfactant (to increase lather) - and, from what I&#x27;ve read, may remove some beneficial oils from skin/hair... as well as being a possible carcinogen.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It made my scalp even more dried out/I have never had so much dandruff. I thought maybe my scalp was just transitioning to it, but it&#x27;s been weeks now with the same result.</li>
            <li> Cleans and conditions as expected for a price not as high as the high-end salon where I once purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I started using the Nioxin system when I noticed hair in the drain with every wash.  My hairdresser recommended it and it has stopped the hair loss. The shampoo gives a thorough cleansing and rinses out thoroughly</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for the last 5 years and she absolutely swears by it!!! She takes a lot of medications and started to notice her hair was shedding more than normal and becoming thin so she purchased this shampoo and hasn&#x27;t used anything else since!! Give it a try IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended by my hairdresser.  I like what it does for my hair.  Will definitely order more soon .</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service. Because of the cost, it is hard to fine in my area. My hair requires this.</li>
            <li> I have had thinning hair for years before being led to this product.  It has helped my hair to thicken noticeably.  I also like it because even though it is a little expensive, I don&#x27;t have to buy it as often as I do regular shampoo.  A bottle usually last me a year and a half.</li>
            <li> This was for the MR. Doesn&#x27;t really make your hair grow, but these help in making hair look fuller. I think his hair fall did get lesser after using this and the conditioner. This was suggested to me by my hairstylist as well as his in different salons. Oh and sometimes I buy his stock at TJ Maxx at amazing prices.</li>
            <li> good cleaning shampoo</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a number of years and like it. Although some misread the advertisement and think this will thicken your hair, it doesn&#x27;t, it only makes your hair look thicker. I am happy with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This was a flawless transaction. The product was delivered as expected and the price was very reasonable. This shampoo can be very expensive so I would consider this a good value.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years. My hair was falling out, and stopped after using Nioxin.  My scalp doesnt itch anymore either.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over 15 years.  Hard to find product.  Works well and i truly believe this is helping with my hair loss</li>
            <li> My wife has used Nioxin for a couple of years. She has noticed that her hair is thicker and healthier. This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product two years ago.  I was having a lot of hair fall out.  I had a thyroid condition at the time and it made a real difference, for the good. I am on thyroid medication but when I stopped using the shampoo I could see an increase in hair loss.  Glad to be using it again.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo. Not sure if it thickened my hair but I liked how it cleaned my curly hair. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly...and as always...a great product</li>
            <li> Caveat emptor - Almost half the ingredients have been removed.&lt;br /&gt;This product line is no longer being made in the USA by Nioxin Research Laboratories based in Atlanta Georgia. The company was taken over by the Wella Corporation and is now manufactured in Mexico. The fine folks at Wella have seen fit to remove almost half of the 62 original ingredients. A quick internet search reveals the relatively high cost of some of these summarily deleted components. Wella corporation is now selling us half the product for the same formerly justified price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thickening effect? GONE. Tingling scalp and pleasant scent? NO MORE.&lt;br /&gt;As a former loyal Nioxin user and booster, frankly,  I feel scalped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, they HAVE added SODIUM-LAURYL-SULFATE,  apparently as a surfactant (to increase lather) - and, from what I&#x27;ve read, may remove some beneficial oils from skin/hair... as well as being a possible carcinogen. sigh. Well done, Wella.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEA-LAURYL-SULFATE  - removed&lt;br /&gt;HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HONEY - removed&lt;br /&gt;PEG 150 DISTEARATE - removed&lt;br /&gt;PANTHENOL - removed&lt;br /&gt;GLYCOPROTEINS - removed&lt;br /&gt;POLYSORBATE 60 - removed&lt;br /&gt;POLYSORBATE 80 - removed&lt;br /&gt;HYDROLYZED KERATIN - removed&lt;br /&gt;ACETAMIDE MEA - removed&lt;br /&gt;ETHOXYDIGLYCOL - removed&lt;br /&gt;DIMETHYL ISOSORBIDE - removed&lt;br /&gt;COENZYME A - removed&lt;br /&gt;BIOTIN - removed&lt;br /&gt;NIACIN - removed&lt;br /&gt;THIAMINE HCL - removed&lt;br /&gt;UBIQUINONE - removed&lt;br /&gt;ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM - removed&lt;br /&gt;ANTHEMIS NOBILIS - removed&lt;br /&gt;CITRUS GRANDIS - removed&lt;br /&gt;EQUISETUM ARVENSE - removed&lt;br /&gt;SALVIA OFFICINALIS - removed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
            <li> The customer service was great on this product.  When it arrived, it had leaked all over.  When  I told the company about the problem, they sent a replacement for what was lost and it was really packaged well this time.  They listened.</li>
            <li> Have used nioxin  for years, wonderful product. If I stop using it for any length of time my hair starts to look thin again. Really does work!</li>
            <li> I would be bald without this stuff GREAT STUFF</li>
