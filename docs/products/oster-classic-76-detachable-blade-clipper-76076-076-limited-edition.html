            <li>Dissapoinment to say the least.....looked great when I got it...</li>
            <li>This is a great clipper and it was a great price here.</li>
            <li>Once I felt the weight and power of these clippers they are in a league of their own!</li>
            <li>They cut very nice and I purchased a #2 metal blade as well and loved the way it worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a hefty buzz to it when on and a good rumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quality rugged barber shop machine which I purchased for home use.</li>
            <li>Good product for working pros in the business.</li>

            <li>Great clippers, high quality, superb cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>Good buy, it really works perfectly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this clipper!</li>
            <li>Besides the heat, they were amazing.  </li>
            <li>But you can still cut your own hair, but it takes practice.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the sender would contact me, I am a stylist</li>
            <li>After about 6 or 7 minutes of use they became extremely warm.  </li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t cover the exhaust port, if you use it for extended periods of time, 5-10+ minutes, it gets a bit warm.  </li>
            <li>I own, 2 salons</li>
            <li>I returned these and ordered the non-limited edition Oster Classic 76 and am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>They were very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Blades are very easy to change.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, Amazon really offers the best price in market.</li>
            <li>and these are by far the best clippers ever</li>
            <li>Beautiful product, this Oster classic limited edition looks really great and works perfect.</li>
            <li>Powerful and best of all quick...</li>
            <li>It is still going strong with no issues!  </li>
            <li>Basically everything good they say is true.</li>
            <li>Very smooth clipper.</li>
            <li>Very smooth carriage&lt;</li>
            <li>They are very precise and made with high-quality.</li>
            <li>Very good professional.</li>
            <li>I love their durability and quality of the equipment and blades.  </li>
            <li>If you take care of the blades as per the manufacturer&#x27;s instruction, it will take care of you for many years.</li>
            <li>Been using it a lot more than the 111 that I had.</li>
            <li>Since there are so many reviews out already</li>
            <li>I could not have asked for anything better.</li>
            <li>Love these clippers.</li>
            <li>I discarded the faulty blade and have been extremely satisfied with the clippers, otherwise.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better than an Oster</li>
            <li>Great product saved so much money.</li>
            <li>I love them as a barber.  </li>
            <li>Either way...compared to Whal clippers they are TOP OF THE LINE.</li>
            <li>Any suggestions from current owners would be great!</li>
            <li>Make sure you use Oster blades for it.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this clipper out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>glad i found it.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased with the results either way.</li>
            <li>While shopping for those replacements, I did my homework and decided instead to use what many professionals in salons use, and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth buzz.</li>
            <li>It would be much more ergonomic to use on somebody else...</li>
            <li>It would be much more ergonomic to use on somebody else...</li>
            <li>I look forward to many years with these.</li>
            <li>I will preface my statement by saying I love my Oster clippers and blades.</li>
            <li>Probably not a problem for most.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I plan to keep and use it for many many years to come.</li>
            <li>Gives nice and clean cut.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and it cuts perfectly, I have used other clippers before, this one suit me fine</li>
            <li>As expected, very happy with the clippers.  </li>
            <li>better than my cheap Wahl clippers with plastic attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
            <li>Also it is easy to handle and control and when you turn it on you can hear the expert craftsmanship that went into building this product.</li>
            <li>(how cool is that)  :)   </li>
            <li>These are hands down the best clippers you can get.  </li>
            <li>and it was a great hair cut with no long hairs.</li>
            <li>easy to fade, very durable, nice built in cooling system.</li>
            <li>I dropped this and broke the switch but found that parts are easily available and easy to fit.</li>
            <li>I decided to use my sound meter; these clippers measured 84 decibels from one foot away.  </li>
            <li>I can comfortably hold it between my thumb and index finger.</li>
            <li>and i use the provided oil and things have been going smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping to get a scratch free machine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean and change blades.</li>
            <li>Its better paying the extra money and your good to go.</li>
            <li>After reading many many reviews I decided to spend a decent amount of money on a set of clippers.</li>
            <li>great job, great product looks like this meat axe of a clipper will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to change between clipper size.</li>
            <li>They look great in grey as well.</li>
            <li>I just got this clipper and the color looks amazing and smells new, on the lower portion of the clipper it has 2 scratches</li>
            <li>I just use it for my own hair, so it will probably be awhile before it needs a new blade.</li>
            <li>hair clean and even.</li>
            <li>but it definitely didn&#x27;t sound good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cuts so clean and even.</li>
            <li>His head was clean shaven and not irriated at all.</li>
            <li>Cuts smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this clipper.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s true, but</li>
            <li>The manual does mention that there will be a break-in period before full performance is achieved so hopefully that will be the case.  </li>
            <li>Heavy weight, nice outer casing, the blade it came with was perfect for his buzzing, and overall-</li>
            <li>These clippers are so smooth and powerful</li>
            <li>Cuts true every time.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>My son cannot say enough good things about this clipper.</li>
            <li>and I always have the Oster 76 in my men&#x27;s full service salon....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair off and on for 16 years, and I do have to say these are excellent clippers.</li>
            <li>I had used an adequate clipper before that had what now seems like primitive clamp on  plastic attachments that govern the length of hair that&#x27;s removed.</li>
            <li>The detachable clipper blades snap in securely and easily and if you wear a buzz cut, i.e. closely cropped style, you&#x27;ll find your trim takes only minutes and results in a more controlled and consistent result.</li>
            <li>it is super powerful and just eats through my hair with ease.</li>
            <li>, if you are looking for very good quality clippers Oster profesional clippers are hard to beat.</li>
            <li>and I know how this product should cut and sound, Very dissapointed-perhaps it is refurbished&gt;?  </li>
            <li>Great clipper but the on off switch broke off after a few months of owning it</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This is a professional tool that you&#x27;ll  be able to use for years.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Powerful will cut through the thickest hair.</li>
            <li>worth the investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>worth the investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I groom my own poodle and had an oster detachabe blade clipper for 25 years and finally it seems to be heating up a lot, so I purchased another one..</li>
            <li>but boy is it worth it.</li>
            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>Get hot fast, but easy to use</li>
            <li>The triple aught blade gets nice and close and the strong motor cuts down the time it takes me to shave my head by 1/4.</li>
            <li>it was a better deal than most other sites.</li>
            <li>Gives a good close cut and seems extremely durable.</li>
            <li>Used to buy a new (cheap) clipper every year or two.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not loud and does not get hot, just warm.</li>
            <li>76 clippers, over all the gray color makes it look amazing, looking forward to getting the limited editon t linner trimmer.</li>
            <li>The body of the clipper does get warm after a few minutes but it is not too hot to hold relatively comfortably.</li>
            <li>They are durable, light weight, and easy to move around with the long cord.  </li>
            <li>On my initial cut I didn&#x27;t find that, I still needed to go over the area more than once to trim all the hairs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not nearly as big an issue if you are using the clippers on another person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These clippers cut FAST!</li>
            <li>Best clipper in the game!</li>
            <li>First time owning an Oster after a lifetime of Target/Walmart level clippers.  </li>
            <li>I oiled the 76 clippers before first use.  </li>
            <li>I figured it was from the first time use.  </li>
            <li>Either you buy this once, or you eventually end up spending more on multiple cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>can get hot after a while</li>
            <li>When you spend the money on a quality product it really pays!</li>
            <li>Just used them today for the first time.</li>
            <li>Item is exactly as described on web page.</li>
            <li>They will lose lubrication and get extremely hot if you use them for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li>If you are a professional hair stylist/barber these are a must have!!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get jammed, it doesn&#x27;t get snagged and pull my hair, just easily and cleanly trims it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get jammed, it doesn&#x27;t get snagged and pull my hair, just easily and cleanly trims it.  </li>
            <li>When operated it sounds like an old wash machine and does not cut clean.</li>
            <li>I used a Whal to do the job all that time with decent success</li>
            <li>am very satisfied with this product and if it lives as long as my old one does, I will be estatic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, powerful and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Speaking only for my simple needs, I appreciate a product that&#x27;s exceptionally well made and durable</li>
            <li>Just clean the hair off with a brush and make sure you oil and grease occasionally and these will last forever!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I have a complete set of blades purchased separately.</li>
            <li>I previously had the Oster Classic 76 and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>but this is ultra easy and will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I typically trim every couple weeks in the summer and it&#x27;s nice to reach for these clippers knowing it&#x27;s not going to be a hassle and that they will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I typically trim every couple weeks in the summer and it&#x27;s nice to reach for these clippers knowing it&#x27;s not going to be a hassle and that they will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>This thing seems built to last, and has been going strong for a year with no degradation in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing seems built to last, and has been going strong for a year with no degradation in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every so often I&#x27;ll go to the barber, but by and large</li>
            <li>If it were to get hot or loud it would be most likely operator error: improper blade adjustment or inadequate lubrication.</li>
            <li>Very high quality product.</li>
            <li>His only gripe about them is that the advertised plastic blades that they often sell along with these don&#x27;t fit the blade very well.  </li>
            <li>Quality  lots of different blade attachments available  </li>
            <li>Was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a correct tool for everything and using it just makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a real motor in this thing, and when you turn it on you&#x27;re realize that.  </li>
            <li>Compared to those cheap local store brands we buy all the time.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Thanks OSTER.</li>
            <li>Also, this really isn&#x27;t an edging trimmer, so you will probably want to get one independent from this for clean lines.  </li>
            <li>My husband used this product after trying so many other clippers.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews about the 0000 blade I just ordered that to save even more time between cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oster-</li>
            <li>My main issue with these clippers is they over heat way too fast.</li>
            <li>I can take this and in one motion trim hair from my front hairline all the way back with no hiccups and a clean trim.  </li>
            <li>so you will probably want to get one independent from this for clean lines.  </li>
            <li>Some of them worked fairly well, but ultimately broke down from overuse.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didnt give it a full 5 stars is that there is no storage case...</li>
            <li>It costs three times more than average but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Ide say im dissapointed in the product, and you&#x27;re better off getting NEW, non-refurbished clippers at a Sally&#x27;s or other beuty supply store.</li>
            <li>Smooth cutting  Easy to maintain  much quieter than cheap vibrating type clippers   </li>
            <li>The weight of the motor puts the center of gravity more towards the rear near the access ports for the carbon brushes.  </li>
            <li>Super reliable and built to last.  </li>
            <li>but the older ones were faster</li>
            <li>Oster Classic 76 Detachable Blade Clipper 76076-076</li>
            <li>Luckily I still had one day left where I could return them to Amazon and not have to send them to Oster for warranty work.</li>
            <li>decent blades&lt;br /</li>
            <li>&gt;  takes a while to heat up (decent fan)&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>Oster Classic 76 comes up...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent tool</li>
            <li>These clippers are a classic.</li>
            <li>I now understand why the price tag is high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended them.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s what  you get with an Oster Classic 76, a professional style clipper that&#x27;s relatively reasonable to buy for home use.  </li>
            <li>Clippers are high quality and constructed very well, professional quality.</li>
            <li>I bought these clippers because I have used ones like these that were way older than me and still working like new even after many years of being used everyday at a profesional barber shop.  </li>
            <li>When trimming my own hair I tend to hold the clippers closer to the business end, so having the center of gravity that far back doesn&#x27;t lend to the smoothest handling or precision.  </li>
            <li>Rock solid, substantial, powerful.  </li>
            <li>I tried a bunch of different barbers and I noticed that the ones that used this particular clipper got the gob done very fast</li>
            <li>Product appeared to be new.</li>
            <li>and if you are new to the do</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;ll easily pay for itself in a year or less</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;ll easily pay for itself in a year or less</li>
            <li>Not what I expected from a $130 set of clippers that cost a lot more than that in the local stores.</li>
            <li>some many other reviews have stated these clippers are built to last.  </li>
            <li>The motor is louder and lacks the familiar buzz of other clippers</li>
            <li>Order arrived early!  </li>
            <li>but it gives you more control over cutting especially if you cut your own hair like I do.</li>
            <li>This is truly a professional hair clipper!</li>
            <li>I have had to learn new ways to hold it in my hands and for the hard to reach spots my darling bride of 52 years was able to cut my hair.  </li>
            <li>As a longtime barber, i&#x27;ve had many pairs of Oster 76ers and these for some reason dont cut the same as my previous ones.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is they are heavy, but very good quality.</li>
            <li>If you only use clippers occasionally it may be hard to justify buying these, but if you cut your hair monthly or more often it&#x27;s well worth your money to purchase these.    </li>
            <li>Professional stylists, of course have a whole different parameter and skill set, though I watched professionals singing the praises of this as well.</li>
            <li>However, when we got these I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This guy holds up, completely durable, I would buy it again if I lost it.</li>
            <li>People say they&#x27;re loud, they&#x27;re not.</li>
            <li>I know that these are for professional use.  </li>
            <li>Very efficient tool that will last you years!!!!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re looking for a real clipper, something like a barber would actually use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, of course there are some caveats to a professional grade trimmer for home use, when using it on yourself.  </li>
            <li>The old one still works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probably worth getting considering the minimal price differential between the two kits when the blades are $20+</li>
            <li>Silver handle is a little unique.  </li>
            <li>i cut my own hair and i have burned out two cheaper clippers (whose combined price is the same as the Classic 76) with my thick hair, despite my regular maintenance.</li>
            <li>The gear and blades are easily replaceable which means these will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li>This is my  3rd set and this particular clipper doesn&#x27;t remove the hair well.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice too much of a weight difference with my old clippers, but it did show up in the ergonomics if you are cutting your own hair.  </li>
            <li>For a guy who has been cutting his own hair for this long, I really wished I would have splurged for this much sooner.  </li>
            <li>For a guy who has been cutting his own hair for this long, I really wished I would have splurged for this much sooner.  </li>
            <li>blades don&#x27;t cut really well, can&#x27;t seem to do a single pass cut</li>
            <li>There are exhaust ports on the backside of the unit right below where the black Oster plaque is on the front that you shouldn&#x27;t cover with your hand.  </li>
            <li>It ran a little cooler with the fresh grease.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty simple and do straightforward buzz cuts in the summer to alleviate some heat from the summer Arizona heat, and already knew approximately what length I wanted</li>
            <li>These are for human hair right?There is also no oil spout on the Side like the regular classic 76.</li>
            <li>I can barely feel the vibration from it when trimming my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This replaced my twenty six years old 76&#x27;s that finally died on me.  </li>
            <li>The sound of the motor reminded me or a small handheld vacuum cleaner.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality long lasting clippers, just click</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my fair share of clippers, but the problem is that all of them would struggle to trim my relatively thick hair and would get jammed up, and they all broke down and became unreliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am very surprised that a reputable company like Amazon would allow this extensive false advertising to continue!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this seller sold a refurbished one as new or if the new ones aren&#x27;t as sturdy as the old 76ers.</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace an old Oster clipper and found this new one to be very heavy duty and professional, though a bit large and heavy.</li>
            <li>I got the limited edition ones because I did not like the red of the other ones, black would have been fine.</li>
            <li>While the color is cool, it is definitely not worth the trade off of one less blade (the regular one comes with 2 blades, 000 and #1 blades).</li>
            <li>The cutting ability is just amazing; makes you actually look forward to getting a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after a couple years&#x27; use I took apart the drive mechanism and re-greased it.</li>

            <li> This is a great clipper and it was a great price here.</li>
            <li> Once I felt the weight and power of these clippers they are in a league of their own!</li>
            <li> They cut very nice and I purchased a #2 metal blade as well and loved the way it worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a hefty buzz to it when on and a good rumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Love this clipper!</li>
            <li> Besides the heat, they were amazing.  </li>
            <li> But you can still cut your own hair, but it takes practice.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the sender would contact me, I am a stylist</li>
            <li> After about 6 or 7 minutes of use they became extremely warm.  </li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t cover the exhaust port, if you use it for extended periods of time, 5-10+ minutes, it gets a bit warm.  </li>
            <li> I own, 2 salons</li>
            <li> I returned these and ordered the non-limited edition Oster Classic 76 and am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> They were very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Blades are very easy to change.</li>

            <li> Powerful and best of all quick...</li>
            <li> It is still going strong with no issues!  </li>
            <li> Basically everything good they say is true.</li>
            <li> Very smooth clipper.</li>
            <li> Very smooth carriage&lt;</li>
            <li> They are very precise and made with high-quality.</li>
            <li> Very good professional.</li>
            <li> I love their durability and quality of the equipment and blades.  </li>
            <li> If you take care of the blades as per the manufacturer&#x27;s instruction, it will take care of you for many years.</li>
            <li> Been using it a lot more than the 111 that I had.</li>
            <li> Since there are so many reviews out already</li>
            <li> I could not have asked for anything better.</li>
            <li> Love these clippers.</li>
            <li> I discarded the faulty blade and have been extremely satisfied with the clippers, otherwise.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better than an Oster</li>
            <li> Great product saved so much money.</li>
            <li> I love them as a barber.  </li>
            <li> Either way...compared to Whal clippers they are TOP OF THE LINE.</li>
            <li> Any suggestions from current owners would be great!</li>
            <li> Make sure you use Oster blades for it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this clipper out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> glad i found it.</li>
            <li> You will be pleased with the results either way.</li>
            <li> While shopping for those replacements, I did my homework and decided instead to use what many professionals in salons use, and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth buzz.</li>
            <li> It would be much more ergonomic to use on somebody else...</li>
            <li> It would be much more ergonomic to use on somebody else...</li>
            <li> I look forward to many years with these.</li>
            <li> I will preface my statement by saying I love my Oster clippers and blades.</li>
            <li> Probably not a problem for most.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep and use it for many many years to come.</li>
            <li> Gives nice and clean cut.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and it cuts perfectly, I have used other clippers before, this one suit me fine</li>
            <li> As expected, very happy with the clippers.  </li>
            <li> better than my cheap Wahl clippers with plastic attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
            <li> Also it is easy to handle and control and when you turn it on you can hear the expert craftsmanship that went into building this product.</li>
            <li> (how cool is that)  :)   </li>
            <li> These are hands down the best clippers you can get.  </li>
            <li> and it was a great hair cut with no long hairs.</li>
            <li> easy to fade, very durable, nice built in cooling system.</li>
            <li> I dropped this and broke the switch but found that parts are easily available and easy to fit.</li>
            <li> I decided to use my sound meter; these clippers measured 84 decibels from one foot away.  </li>
            <li> I can comfortably hold it between my thumb and index finger.</li>
            <li> and i use the provided oil and things have been going smoothly.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping to get a scratch free machine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean and change blades.</li>
            <li> Its better paying the extra money and your good to go.</li>
            <li> After reading many many reviews I decided to spend a decent amount of money on a set of clippers.</li>
            <li> great job, great product looks like this meat axe of a clipper will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to change between clipper size.</li>
            <li> They look great in grey as well.</li>
            <li> I just got this clipper and the color looks amazing and smells new, on the lower portion of the clipper it has 2 scratches</li>
            <li> I just use it for my own hair, so it will probably be awhile before it needs a new blade.</li>
            <li> hair clean and even.</li>
            <li> but it definitely didn&#x27;t sound good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cuts so clean and even.</li>
            <li> His head was clean shaven and not irriated at all.</li>
            <li> Cuts smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this clipper.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s true, but</li>
            <li> The manual does mention that there will be a break-in period before full performance is achieved so hopefully that will be the case.  </li>
            <li> Heavy weight, nice outer casing, the blade it came with was perfect for his buzzing, and overall-</li>
            <li> These clippers are so smooth and powerful</li>
            <li> Cuts true every time.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> My son cannot say enough good things about this clipper.</li>
            <li> and I always have the Oster 76 in my men&#x27;s full service salon....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair off and on for 16 years, and I do have to say these are excellent clippers.</li>
            <li> I had used an adequate clipper before that had what now seems like primitive clamp on  plastic attachments that govern the length of hair that&#x27;s removed.</li>
            <li> The detachable clipper blades snap in securely and easily and if you wear a buzz cut, i.e. closely cropped style, you&#x27;ll find your trim takes only minutes and results in a more controlled and consistent result.</li>
            <li> it is super powerful and just eats through my hair with ease.</li>
            <li> , if you are looking for very good quality clippers Oster profesional clippers are hard to beat.</li>
            <li> and I know how this product should cut and sound, Very dissapointed-perhaps it is refurbished&gt;?  </li>
            <li> Great clipper but the on off switch broke off after a few months of owning it</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> This is a professional tool that you&#x27;ll  be able to use for years.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Powerful will cut through the thickest hair.</li>
            <li> worth the investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worth the investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I groom my own poodle and had an oster detachabe blade clipper for 25 years and finally it seems to be heating up a lot, so I purchased another one..</li>
            <li> but boy is it worth it.</li>
            <li> Powerful.</li>
            <li> Get hot fast, but easy to use</li>
            <li> The triple aught blade gets nice and close and the strong motor cuts down the time it takes me to shave my head by 1/4.</li>
            <li> it was a better deal than most other sites.</li>
            <li> Gives a good close cut and seems extremely durable.</li>
            <li> Used to buy a new (cheap) clipper every year or two.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not loud and does not get hot, just warm.</li>
            <li> 76 clippers, over all the gray color makes it look amazing, looking forward to getting the limited editon t linner trimmer.</li>
            <li> The body of the clipper does get warm after a few minutes but it is not too hot to hold relatively comfortably.</li>
            <li> They are durable, light weight, and easy to move around with the long cord.  </li>
            <li> On my initial cut I didn&#x27;t find that, I still needed to go over the area more than once to trim all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not nearly as big an issue if you are using the clippers on another person.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These clippers cut FAST!</li>
            <li> Best clipper in the game!</li>
            <li> First time owning an Oster after a lifetime of Target/Walmart level clippers.  </li>
            <li> I oiled the 76 clippers before first use.  </li>
            <li> I figured it was from the first time use.  </li>
            <li> Either you buy this once, or you eventually end up spending more on multiple cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> can get hot after a while</li>
            <li> When you spend the money on a quality product it really pays!</li>
            <li> Just used them today for the first time.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly as described on web page.</li>
            <li> They will lose lubrication and get extremely hot if you use them for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> If you are a professional hair stylist/barber these are a must have!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get jammed, it doesn&#x27;t get snagged and pull my hair, just easily and cleanly trims it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get jammed, it doesn&#x27;t get snagged and pull my hair, just easily and cleanly trims it.  </li>
            <li> When operated it sounds like an old wash machine and does not cut clean.</li>
            <li> I used a Whal to do the job all that time with decent success</li>
            <li> am very satisfied with this product and if it lives as long as my old one does, I will be estatic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, powerful and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Speaking only for my simple needs, I appreciate a product that&#x27;s exceptionally well made and durable</li>
            <li> Just clean the hair off with a brush and make sure you oil and grease occasionally and these will last forever!</li>
            <li> Luckily, I have a complete set of blades purchased separately.</li>
            <li> I previously had the Oster Classic 76 and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> but this is ultra easy and will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically trim every couple weeks in the summer and it&#x27;s nice to reach for these clippers knowing it&#x27;s not going to be a hassle and that they will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I typically trim every couple weeks in the summer and it&#x27;s nice to reach for these clippers knowing it&#x27;s not going to be a hassle and that they will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> This thing seems built to last, and has been going strong for a year with no degradation in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing seems built to last, and has been going strong for a year with no degradation in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every so often I&#x27;ll go to the barber, but by and large</li>
            <li> If it were to get hot or loud it would be most likely operator error: improper blade adjustment or inadequate lubrication.</li>
            <li> Very high quality product.</li>
            <li> His only gripe about them is that the advertised plastic blades that they often sell along with these don&#x27;t fit the blade very well.  </li>
            <li> Quality  lots of different blade attachments available  </li>
            <li> Was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a correct tool for everything and using it just makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a real motor in this thing, and when you turn it on you&#x27;re realize that.  </li>
            <li> Compared to those cheap local store brands we buy all the time.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Thanks OSTER.</li>
            <li> Also, this really isn&#x27;t an edging trimmer, so you will probably want to get one independent from this for clean lines.  </li>
            <li> My husband used this product after trying so many other clippers.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews about the 0000 blade I just ordered that to save even more time between cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oster-</li>
            <li> My main issue with these clippers is they over heat way too fast.</li>
            <li> I can take this and in one motion trim hair from my front hairline all the way back with no hiccups and a clean trim.  </li>
            <li> so you will probably want to get one independent from this for clean lines.  </li>
            <li> Some of them worked fairly well, but ultimately broke down from overuse.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didnt give it a full 5 stars is that there is no storage case...</li>
            <li> It costs three times more than average but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Ide say im dissapointed in the product, and you&#x27;re better off getting NEW, non-refurbished clippers at a Sally&#x27;s or other beuty supply store.</li>
            <li> Smooth cutting  Easy to maintain  much quieter than cheap vibrating type clippers   </li>
            <li> The weight of the motor puts the center of gravity more towards the rear near the access ports for the carbon brushes.  </li>
            <li> Super reliable and built to last.  </li>
            <li> but the older ones were faster</li>
            <li> Oster Classic 76 Detachable Blade Clipper 76076-076</li>
            <li> Luckily I still had one day left where I could return them to Amazon and not have to send them to Oster for warranty work.</li>
            <li> decent blades&lt;br /</li>
            <li> &gt;  takes a while to heat up (decent fan)&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> Oster Classic 76 comes up...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent tool</li>
            <li> These clippers are a classic.</li>
            <li> I now understand why the price tag is high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended them.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s what  you get with an Oster Classic 76, a professional style clipper that&#x27;s relatively reasonable to buy for home use.  </li>
            <li> Clippers are high quality and constructed very well, professional quality.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because I have used ones like these that were way older than me and still working like new even after many years of being used everyday at a profesional barber shop.  </li>
            <li> When trimming my own hair I tend to hold the clippers closer to the business end, so having the center of gravity that far back doesn&#x27;t lend to the smoothest handling or precision.  </li>
            <li> Rock solid, substantial, powerful.  </li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of different barbers and I noticed that the ones that used this particular clipper got the gob done very fast</li>
            <li> Product appeared to be new.</li>
            <li> and if you are new to the do</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll easily pay for itself in a year or less</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll easily pay for itself in a year or less</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from a $130 set of clippers that cost a lot more than that in the local stores.</li>
            <li> some many other reviews have stated these clippers are built to last.  </li>
            <li> The motor is louder and lacks the familiar buzz of other clippers</li>
            <li> Order arrived early!  </li>
            <li> but it gives you more control over cutting especially if you cut your own hair like I do.</li>
            <li> This is truly a professional hair clipper!</li>
            <li> I have had to learn new ways to hold it in my hands and for the hard to reach spots my darling bride of 52 years was able to cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> As a longtime barber, i&#x27;ve had many pairs of Oster 76ers and these for some reason dont cut the same as my previous ones.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is they are heavy, but very good quality.</li>
            <li> If you only use clippers occasionally it may be hard to justify buying these, but if you cut your hair monthly or more often it&#x27;s well worth your money to purchase these.    </li>
            <li> Professional stylists, of course have a whole different parameter and skill set, though I watched professionals singing the praises of this as well.</li>
            <li> However, when we got these I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This guy holds up, completely durable, I would buy it again if I lost it.</li>
            <li> People say they&#x27;re loud, they&#x27;re not.</li>
            <li> I know that these are for professional use.  </li>
            <li> Very efficient tool that will last you years!!!!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re looking for a real clipper, something like a barber would actually use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, of course there are some caveats to a professional grade trimmer for home use, when using it on yourself.  </li>
            <li> The old one still works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably worth getting considering the minimal price differential between the two kits when the blades are $20+</li>
            <li> Silver handle is a little unique.  </li>
            <li> i cut my own hair and i have burned out two cheaper clippers (whose combined price is the same as the Classic 76) with my thick hair, despite my regular maintenance.</li>
            <li> The gear and blades are easily replaceable which means these will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> This is my  3rd set and this particular clipper doesn&#x27;t remove the hair well.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice too much of a weight difference with my old clippers, but it did show up in the ergonomics if you are cutting your own hair.  </li>
            <li> For a guy who has been cutting his own hair for this long, I really wished I would have splurged for this much sooner.  </li>
            <li> For a guy who has been cutting his own hair for this long, I really wished I would have splurged for this much sooner.  </li>
            <li> blades don&#x27;t cut really well, can&#x27;t seem to do a single pass cut</li>
            <li> There are exhaust ports on the backside of the unit right below where the black Oster plaque is on the front that you shouldn&#x27;t cover with your hand.  </li>
            <li> It ran a little cooler with the fresh grease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty simple and do straightforward buzz cuts in the summer to alleviate some heat from the summer Arizona heat, and already knew approximately what length I wanted</li>
            <li> These are for human hair right?There is also no oil spout on the Side like the regular classic 76.</li>
            <li> I can barely feel the vibration from it when trimming my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This replaced my twenty six years old 76&#x27;s that finally died on me.  </li>
            <li> The sound of the motor reminded me or a small handheld vacuum cleaner.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality long lasting clippers, just click</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my fair share of clippers, but the problem is that all of them would struggle to trim my relatively thick hair and would get jammed up, and they all broke down and became unreliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am very surprised that a reputable company like Amazon would allow this extensive false advertising to continue!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this seller sold a refurbished one as new or if the new ones aren&#x27;t as sturdy as the old 76ers.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace an old Oster clipper and found this new one to be very heavy duty and professional, though a bit large and heavy.</li>
            <li> I got the limited edition ones because I did not like the red of the other ones, black would have been fine.</li>
            <li> While the color is cool, it is definitely not worth the trade off of one less blade (the regular one comes with 2 blades, 000 and #1 blades).</li>
            <li> The cutting ability is just amazing; makes you actually look forward to getting a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after a couple years&#x27; use I took apart the drive mechanism and re-greased it.</li>
            <li> i just hope it last a long time like the other classic</li>
            <li> After enjoying a youth of luxurious hair, and the attendant high cost of stylists cutting it, I&#x27;ve succumbed to the ravages of time, which commonly leaves men, follicly challenged, and requiring a closely cropped hair style.</li>
            <li> The clipper is considerably heavier than store clippers, which I think is due to the bigger motor powering them.</li>
            <li> Bought 4 years ago due to being a professional model.  </li>
            <li> The $100+ price tag was definitely a factor in why I waited so long, it just didn&#x27;t make sense to me to pay double of what drug store clippers cost.</li>
            <li> Been cutting my own hair for 20+ years, I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get these.  </li>
            <li> I waited a long time to finally order these clippers.</li>
            <li> We have gone through several other clippers &amp; trimmers and they all seem cheap and fall apart within a few weeks to a few months.</li>
            <li> Good cutting, have to get used to the weight - it&#x27;s more geared towards people cutting other people&#x27;s hair rather than doing it yourself.  </li>
            <li> Looks like it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> A little bit heavier than expected, but works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy compared to the typical home use clippers, large, and somewhat awkward to hold and trim your own hair.  </li>
            <li> Heavier than what I&#x27;m use to for chain store clipper, but that just means to me that they will be around for a long time.</li>
            <li> so I think they will work for him for a long time.</li>
            <li> They make a strange unfamiliar noise.</li>
            <li> i have had these clippers for a long time now</li>
            <li> Runs long and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snap</li>
            <li> but I think I have a strange way I use them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems to skip over some of the hair and leaves long pieces.</li>
            <li> Long cord.</li>
            <li> the minute I put a blade on and started a cut you can tell this clipper is junk the blade wobbled all around, I tried several different blades, new ones , old ones...and too just the weight and the feel of it is all wrong.....</li>
            <li> I use the blade size 00000 for all of my head and cut it down to an almost bare scape.</li>
            <li> The limited edition silver case is the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> (Limited Edition)-</li>
            <li> So I ordered this Limited Edition as it was advertised with the AgION blade.</li>
            <li> its limited because its garbage.</li>
            <li> I think it is actually cheaper because it will outlast any three &#x27;average&#x27; clippers.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed with these clippers, i cut my own hair and have for years now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair (buzz cut) off and on for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> I have very thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a little loud and a bit heavy, but it is what it is--not a &amp;#34;home use&amp;#34; clipper.  </li>
            <li> Worked as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a heavy duty clipper BUT not a commercial one.  </li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly (no pulling) in one pass, it doesn&#x27;t bog down, and feels like it will last forever.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by that but didn&#x27;t want to return them over it but wondered what I would do if I was an actual barber and cut multiple people&#x27;s hair one right after another.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had at least one of all the major brands of clippers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve heard absolutely no complaints about them!</li>
            <li> Also, the blade is still sharp.</li>
            <li> From the other reviews it seems like the LE has heat up issues, but I would imagine the motor noise issue is isolated.</li>
            <li> Those other clippers can&#x27;t even compare.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have any experience in interchanging with other blades.</li>
            <li> Other clippers would leave his head bumpy and itchy.</li>
            <li> Not hot, but warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking to trim other people&#x27;s hair, like your son or something, this would be a 5 star product in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking to trim other people&#x27;s hair, like your son or something, this would be a 5 star product in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I took a wetstone to the sharp edge of the blade</li>
            <li> However the third time I went to use them the motor started making a loud weird noise.</li>
            <li> You have to actively maintenance them but when take care of they will reward you.</li>
            <li> Other than that, below average.</li>
            <li> Finally bought a real deal buzzer instead of the piece of crap pharmacy ones that rob you at $30 and last a year maybe.</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought myself one of these</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s built like a tank and if it can get through me, it can cut down a rain</li>
            <li> Every other oster has this!</li>
            <li> After going through half a dozen cheaper clippers I wish I would have just gotten these at the beginning.   </li>
            <li> What I am most unhappy about is Amazon allowing false advertising of the products they sell on their web site (this in spite of the fact that you have been notified a number of times in the reviews on your web site that the products received were not as they were described).</li>
            <li> You advertise on probably half of all of your Oster blades as having the Agion coating, when you know that they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is the one to get if you like to keep it tight but not bald.</li>
            <li> Because it reliably trims my hair, and all that it asks is for a little cleaning between trims.  </li>
            <li> Because it reliably trims my hair, and all that it asks is for a little cleaning between trims.  </li>
            <li> I didnt just want to blow money on something that he would destroy in a week.</li>
            <li> People say they&#x27;re heavy, they&#x27;re not.</li>
            <li> it is not that heavy.</li>
            <li> it yourself approach, be assured that  this purchase will pay for itself in just a few months of effortless use.</li>
            <li> He cuts his hair 2-3 times a week and has been using this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> and considering our past track record</li>
            <li> We had purchased 5 or 6 big-retail-store clippers over the years, what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> A little heavy if you are not used to it, could make your arm tired.   </li>
            <li> Hard to beat that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li> but I was constantly buzz cutting twice a week</li>
            <li> Needless to say I have been buzz cutting my whole head for about 3 years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other clippers, but all fail after a while.  </li>
            <li> If you have been cutting your hair for a long time, these are the clippers to upgrade too.</li>
            <li> After less than 5 minutes mine were almost uncomfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant on these becuase they seemed so expensive-</li>
            <li> There a bit expensive at little over a hundred dollars</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not happy with this set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> Not happy .</li>
            <li> You are advertising that your Oster blade for these clippers have a Agion coating, which is false.</li>
            <li> In spite of that fact, you are falsely advertising that the blades you are selling do have the Agion coating</li>
            <li> And there is nothing wrong with the toggle switch.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it happened every use after.  </li>
            <li> but now I am gun shy.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Very tough hair cutting machine.</li>
            <li> Since I have had them, I look forward to cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> The shape is ergonomically awkward like cutting hair with a flashlight.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at that price tag...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As expected, very happy with the clippers.  I love their durability and quality of the equipment and blades.  If you take care of the blades as per the manufacturer&#x27;s instruction, it will take care of you for many years.</li>
            <li> Very smooth clipper. I use it every week</li>
            <li> This set only includes the #000 blade.  While I don&#x27;t need the additional #1 blade that comes with the standard red set it&#x27;s probably worth getting considering the minimal price differential between the two kits when the blades are $20+ each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some many other reviews have stated these clippers are built to last.  That&#x27;s true, but at twice the price shouldn&#x27;t you get twice the performance?  On my initial cut I didn&#x27;t find that, I still needed to go over the area more than once to trim all the hairs.  The manual does mention that there will be a break-in period before full performance is achieved so hopefully that will be the case.  They do give you double the noise however, triple actually.  The sound of the motor reminded me or a small handheld vacuum cleaner.  I decided to use my sound meter; these clippers measured 84 decibels from one foot away.  The Wahl kit I&#x27;ve been using for a while measured 60 decibels at the same distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a weight difference with my old clippers, but it did show up in the ergonomics if you are cutting your own hair.  The weight of the motor puts the center of gravity more towards the rear near the access ports for the carbon brushes.  When trimming my own hair I tend to hold the clippers closer to the business end, so having the center of gravity that far back doesn&#x27;t lend to the smoothest handling or precision.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not nearly as big an issue if you are using the clippers on another person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the build quality and short blade options are the reasons to consider this product.</li>
            <li> I waited a long time to finally order these clippers. The $100+ price tag was definitely a factor in why I waited so long, it just didn&#x27;t make sense to me to pay double of what drug store clippers cost. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for 20+ years and I&#x27;ve had at least one of all the major brands of clippers. Once I felt the weight and power of these clippers they are in a league of their own! If you only use clippers occasionally it may be hard to justify buying these, but if you cut your hair monthly or more often it&#x27;s well worth your money to purchase these.    The clipper is considerably heavier than store clippers, which I think is due to the bigger motor powering them. The gear and blades are easily replaceable which means these will last a long, long time. The motor is louder and lacks the familiar buzz of other clippers The body of the clipper does get warm after a few minutes but it is not too hot to hold relatively comfortably. The limited edition silver case is the icing on the cake. Since I have had them, I look forward to cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> Works just like they said it would. Been using it a lot more than the 111 that I had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair off and on for 16 years, and I do have to say these are excellent clippers. They were very easy to use. Heavier than what I&#x27;m use to for chain store clipper, but that just means to me that they will be around for a long time. Blades are very easy to change. I like that I can use a blade instead of a plastic clipper comb to cut my hair. Very high quality product.</li>
            <li> These are hands down the best clippers you can get.  Just clean the hair off with a brush and make sure you oil and grease occasionally and these will last forever!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality long lasting clippers, just click but it now option!! Time saver and perfect for getting a close buzz!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a birthday gift for my husband. He likes to keep his hair very short and therefore, uses clippers on a weekly basis. We have gone through several other clippers &amp; trimmers and they all seem cheap and fall apart within a few weeks to a few months. I was a little hesitant on these becuase they seemed so expensive- and considering our past track record I didnt just want to blow money on something that he would destroy in a week. However, when we got these I was pleasantly surprised. Heavy weight, nice outer casing, the blade it came with was perfect for his buzzing, and overall- it was a better deal than most other sites. He&#x27;s had them for almost a month and I&#x27;ve heard absolutely no complaints about them! He likes their power, and cleanability so I think they will work for him for a long time. The only reason I didnt give it a full 5 stars is that there is no storage case...that would be the cherry on the ice cream!</li>
            <li> Super reliable and built to last.  Worth every penny.  We had purchased 5 or 6 big-retail-store clippers over the years, what a waste of money! This guy holds up, completely durable, I would buy it again if I lost it.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, high quality, superb cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than my cheap Wahl clippers with plastic attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts hair clean and even.</li>
            <li> These clippers cut FAST! easy to fade, very durable, nice built in cooling system. People say they&#x27;re loud, they&#x27;re not. People say they&#x27;re heavy, they&#x27;re not. if you want great clippers for home or pro use, ADD TO CART!</li>
            <li> I was told at my shop that these clippers are used for animals. These are for human hair right?There is also no oil spout on the Side like the regular classic 76. Where do we Put the oil in this machine????</li>
            <li> but the older ones were faster</li>
            <li> This thing is built like a tank! Love it! Since there are so many reviews out already I&#x27;ll try not to repeat them. Basically everything good they say is true. I&#x27;m writing this because I disagree with the complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not loud and does not get hot, just warm. If it were to get hot or loud it would be most likely operator error: improper blade adjustment or inadequate lubrication. You wouldn&#x27;t drive your car without oil, what makes you think you can operate this without oil? In reply to the question about the oil spout, there is no oil spout because the blade is oiled externally and the drive parts are greased. It comes with both oil and grease, and instructions on how to apply them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it is not that heavy. I can comfortably hold it between my thumb and index finger. And there is nothing wrong with the toggle switch. It works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It costs three times more than average but you get what you pay for. I think it is actually cheaper because it will outlast any three &#x27;average&#x27; clippers. The cutting ability is just amazing; makes you actually look forward to getting a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after a couple years&#x27; use I took apart the drive mechanism and re-greased it. Was happy to see that all the parts seem well made and show no signs of wear. It ran a little cooler with the fresh grease. Like I said earlier... Also, the blade is still sharp. I just use it for my own hair, so it will probably be awhile before it needs a new blade.</li>
            <li> If you have been cutting your hair for a long time, these are the clippers to upgrade too. The best there is &gt;.&lt;</li>
            <li> Good cutting, have to get used to the weight - it&#x27;s more geared towards people cutting other people&#x27;s hair rather than doing it yourself.  But you can still cut your own hair, but it takes practice.</li>
            <li> Works great. I could not have asked for anything better. This is a professional tool that you&#x27;ll  be able to use for years. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because I have used ones like these that were way older than me and still working like new even after many years of being used everyday at a profesional barber shop.  Hard to beat that, if you are looking for very good quality clippers Oster profesional clippers are hard to beat. I got the limited edition ones because I did not like the red of the other ones, black would have been fine. After going through half a dozen cheaper clippers I wish I would have just gotten these at the beginning.   Pros:    Quality  lots of different blade attachments available  Smooth cutting  Easy to maintain  much quieter than cheap vibrating type clippers   MADE IN USA (how cool is that)  :)   Cons:  A little heavy if you are not used to it, could make your arm tired.   Did not come with a carry bag.</li>
            <li> Love these clippers. I would give them a 5 star rating except that the blades were not properly machined and routinely grabbed skin. Luckily, I have a complete set of blades purchased separately. I discarded the faulty blade and have been extremely satisfied with the clippers, otherwise.</li>
            <li> Product appeared to be new. When operated it sounds like an old wash machine and does not cut clean. It would be nice if the sender would contact me, I am a stylist and I know how this product should cut and sound, Very dissapointed-perhaps it is refurbished&gt;?  Thank you for asking C</li>
            <li> There is nothing better than an Oster</li>
            <li> Great LOOKING clipper. Other than that, below average. As a longtime barber, i&#x27;ve had many pairs of Oster 76ers and these for some reason dont cut the same as my previous ones. They make a strange unfamiliar noise. I thought it just needed some oil, but theres NO oil valve!! Why is there nowhere to put oil in?? Every other oster has this! Ide say im dissapointed in the product, and you&#x27;re better off getting NEW, non-refurbished clippers at a Sally&#x27;s or other beuty supply store.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is they are heavy, but very good quality.</li>
            <li> Great product saved so much money. i got this because they say these r the best and they truly are... i never will go back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same 76er for almost 10years without ones needing any repairs on it until about 6month ago. So I thought I buy a second one as I use them 5days a week. I ordered this 76er but within 2 weeks one screw was totally worn out and a couple month later I had to replace the cable since it wore out already. I&#x27;m not sure if this seller sold a refurbished one as new or if the new ones aren&#x27;t as sturdy as the old 76ers. Anyways ⭐️</li>
            <li> Order arrived early!  Was everything I expected and more. Clippers are high quality and constructed very well, professional quality.</li>
            <li> Best clipper in the game! Fades, Cesars</li>
            <li> Oster Classic 76 Detachable Blade Clipper 76076-076 (Limited Edition)- ANY oster product you buy stands by it&#x27;s name.  I love them as a barber.  They are durable, light weight, and easy to move around with the long cord.  The cost is cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere even at barber stores! Sally&#x27;s too.  Either way...compared to Whal clippers they are TOP OF THE LINE.</li>
            <li> Rock solid, substantial, powerful.  This will cut the toughest of hair and get the job done.  Perhaps a little loud and a bit heavy, but it is what it is--not a &amp;#34;home use&amp;#34; clipper.  Silver handle is a little unique.  Look forward to years of use.</li>
            <li> After reading many many reviews I decided to spend a decent amount of money on a set of clippers. They cut very nice and I purchased a #2 metal blade as well and loved the way it worked. My main issue with these clippers is they over heat way too fast. After less than 5 minutes mine were almost uncomfortable to hold. I was disappointed by that but didn&#x27;t want to return them over it but wondered what I would do if I was an actual barber and cut multiple people&#x27;s hair one right after another. However the third time I went to use them the motor started making a loud weird noise. The noise would come and go but it definitely didn&#x27;t sound good. Luckily I still had one day left where I could return them to Amazon and not have to send them to Oster for warranty work. From the other reviews it seems like the LE has heat up issues, but I would imagine the motor noise issue is isolated. Who knows though. Not what I expected from a $130 set of clippers that cost a lot more than that in the local stores.</li>
            <li> First time owning an Oster after a lifetime of Target/Walmart level clippers.  My clippers are for private use only.  I oiled the 76 clippers before first use.  I also oiled them after each subsequent use as recommended.  After about 6 or 7 minutes of use they became extremely warm.  I figured it was from the first time use.  Unfortunately, it happened every use after.  I know that these are for professional use.  There&#x27;s no way that these would last a day in a shop.  I called Oster and they recommended that I return them.  I did.  I want to reorder them but now I am gun shy.  Besides the heat, they were amazing.  Those other clippers can&#x27;t even compare.  Any suggestions from current owners would be great!</li>
            <li> I previously had the Oster Classic 76 and was very pleased with it. So I ordered this Limited Edition as it was advertised with the AgION blade. Instead I received the regular blade, not AgION. While the color is cool, it is definitely not worth the trade off of one less blade (the regular one comes with 2 blades, 000 and #1 blades). I returned these and ordered the non-limited edition Oster Classic 76 and am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Worked as well as I expected. Worth the price. Nothing else to say but, I&#x27;m happy! And that is all to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair (buzz cut) off and on for the past 7 years. I started with some cheapo wahl clippers that took 4-6 passes to cut all my hair. I have very thick straight hair. I tried a bunch of different barbers and I noticed that the ones that used this particular clipper got the gob done very fast and it was a great hair cut with no long hairs. I broke down and bought myself one of these and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It cuts cleanly (no pulling) in one pass, it doesn&#x27;t bog down, and feels like it will last forever. Make sure you use Oster blades for it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this clipper out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cuts so clean and even. I can barely feel the vibration from it when trimming my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what others were complaining about with changing the clips but this is ultra easy and will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for one of these for years and glad i found it.</li>
            <li> i cut my own hair and i have burned out two cheaper clippers (whose combined price is the same as the Classic 76) with my thick hair, despite my regular maintenance. i have had these clippers for a long time now and i use the provided oil and things have been going smoothly. i have not felt any decrease in power or hair snagging the teeth at all. it is super powerful and just eats through my hair with ease.</li>
            <li> Get hot fast, but easy to use</li>
            <li> These clippers are so smooth and powerful you could shave the hair off a monkeys ass without them batting an eye!  Will definitely recommend to all my hairy ass friends to keep the jungles under control!</li>
            <li> If you are a professional hair stylist/barber these are a must have!!!! Cuts through even the thickest hair like butter!!!! Very efficient tool that will last you years!!!!</li>
            <li> For years, I have caused a plague on the rednecks of the world.  Those Bigfoot sightings?  I apologize for the misunderstanding, it&#x27;s genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my man-scaper.  I&#x27;ve purchased other clippers, but all fail after a while.  Not this.  It&#x27;s built like a tank and if it can get through me, it can cut down a rain forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry about the price.  Either you buy this once, or you eventually end up spending more on multiple cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I can find. Gives nice and clean cut. precision. and had multiple zero guards.Best on the market, worth the price!</li>
            <li> This IS what you&#x27;ve been looking for. Powerful will cut through the thickest hair. Runs long and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snap on interchangeable blades. You no longer have to use those plastic guards. Cuts true every time.&lt;br /&gt;BUT if you want to save money just purchase with the standard blade, AND use the Oster  Plastic guards only. You will be pleased with the results either way.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone for either a pet or their childen. Looks like it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Pros: Built like a tank&lt;br /&gt;  Very smooth carriage&lt;br /&gt;  decent blades&lt;br /&gt;  takes a while to heat up (decent fan)&lt;br /&gt;  probably the last clipper I will EVER buy.&lt;br /&gt;  saved thousands in haircuts for my sons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Built like a tank&lt;br /&gt;  large&lt;br /&gt;  heavy&lt;br /&gt;  can get hot after a while&lt;br /&gt;  blades don&#x27;t cut really well, can&#x27;t seem to do a single pass cut expect a scap job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still happy all things considered.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a correct tool for everything and using it just makes life so much easier. After enjoying a youth of luxurious hair, and the attendant high cost of stylists cutting it, I&#x27;ve succumbed to the ravages of time, which commonly leaves men, follicly challenged, and requiring a closely cropped hair style. I had used an adequate clipper before that had what now seems like primitive clamp on  plastic attachments that govern the length of hair that&#x27;s removed. Inevitably, those plastic attachments will break and require replacements. While shopping for those replacements, I did my homework and decided instead to use what many professionals in salons use, and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. This Oster is built like a tank and should last forever for one person or a family. The detachable clipper blades snap in securely and easily and if you wear a buzz cut, i.e. closely cropped style, you&#x27;ll find your trim takes only minutes and results in a more controlled and consistent result. Professional stylists, of course have a whole different parameter and skill set, though I watched professionals singing the praises of this as well. Speaking only for my simple needs, I appreciate a product that&#x27;s exceptionally well made and durable and if you are new to the do it yourself approach, be assured that  this purchase will pay for itself in just a few months of effortless use.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Gives a good close cut and seems extremely durable.</li>
            <li> Bought 4 years ago due to being a professional model.  We use it on 5 heads probably once a month.  It is still going strong with no issues!  Used to buy a new (cheap) clipper every year or two.  Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I just got this clipper and the color looks amazing and smells new, on the lower portion of the clipper it has 2 scratches and I was hoping to get a scratch free machine, I did not know it doesnt have an oiler i just hope it last a long time like the other classic 76 clippers, over all the gray color makes it look amazing, looking forward to getting the limited editon t linner trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth buzz. Very easy to use. Finally bought a real deal buzzer instead of the piece of crap pharmacy ones that rob you at $30 and last a year maybe. This is the one to get if you like to keep it tight but not bald.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. I now understand why the price tag is high. These are a solid set of clippers. I only use a specific blade so I don&#x27;t have any experience in interchanging with other blades. I like the fact that these clippers have a solid feel. It&#x27;s hard to explain but it gives you more control over cutting especially if you cut your own hair like I do.</li>
            <li> My husband used this product after trying so many other clippers. Other clippers would leave his head bumpy and itchy. This clipper didn&#x27;t do that. He is very happy with this product. His head was clean shaven and not irriated at all.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and it cuts perfectly, I have used other clippers before, this one suit me fine, it may be the last clipper I buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for... 15 years.  Every so often I&#x27;ll go to the barber, but by and large I just do it myself.  I&#x27;ve had my fair share of clippers, but the problem is that all of them would struggle to trim my relatively thick hair and would get jammed up, and they all broke down and became unreliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this, perhaps that&#x27;s your experience too and you&#x27;re looking for a real clipper, something like a barber would actually use.  And that&#x27;s what  you get with an Oster Classic 76, a professional style clipper that&#x27;s relatively reasonable to buy for home use.  I can take this and in one motion trim hair from my front hairline all the way back with no hiccups and a clean trim.  And that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a real motor in this thing, and when you turn it on you&#x27;re realize that.  It&#x27;s got a hefty buzz to it when on and a good rumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, of course there are some caveats to a professional grade trimmer for home use, when using it on yourself.  I&#x27;ve used this for almost a year now with regular trims.  It&#x27;s heavy compared to the typical home use clippers, large, and somewhat awkward to hold and trim your own hair.  It&#x27;s in no way ergonomic to use on yourself.  There are exhaust ports on the backside of the unit right below where the black Oster plaque is on the front that you shouldn&#x27;t cover with your hand.  Even if you don&#x27;t cover the exhaust port, if you use it for extended periods of time, 5-10+ minutes, it gets a bit warm.  Not hot, but warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More caveats, you need to buy individual clipper heads for the length you want.  This can get costly if you require multiple lengths for fades and whatnot.  I&#x27;m pretty simple and do straightforward buzz cuts in the summer to alleviate some heat from the summer Arizona heat, and already knew approximately what length I wanted so I only had to buy one head.  The one that comes with it is REALLY short, like short enough to shave with short.  Also, this really isn&#x27;t an edging trimmer, so you will probably want to get one independent from this for clean lines.  I&#x27;ve been using the same trimmer I shave my beard with, but eventually I&#x27;ll get an actual line trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All those caveats and still 4 stars?  Yes.  Because it reliably trims my hair, and all that it asks is for a little cleaning between trims.  It doesn&#x27;t get jammed, it doesn&#x27;t get snagged and pull my hair, just easily and cleanly trims it.  That&#x27;s what I wanted and that&#x27;s what I got.  This thing seems built to last, and has been going strong for a year with no degradation in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to trim other people&#x27;s hair, like your son or something, this would be a 5 star product in my opinion.  It would be much more ergonomic to use on somebody else... and when you think about the cost...  sure it&#x27;s expensive for a pair of clippers but it&#x27;ll easily pay for itself in a year or less and it&#x27;s all savings from there.  If you&#x27;re a person that likes to really stay trimmed up, it could pay for itself in a few months, and you could trim as often as you want.  I typically trim every couple weeks in the summer and it&#x27;s nice to reach for these clippers knowing it&#x27;s not going to be a hassle and that they will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/29/14 UPDATE -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still working perfectly!  For a guy who has been cutting his own hair for this long, I really wished I would have splurged for this much sooner.  There has been no degradation of performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/19/17 UPDATE -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still working perfect!rimmer, so you will probably want to get one independent from this for clean lines.

            <li> Great set of clippers. The detachable heads is a plus. Quick and easy to change between clipper size. They look great in grey as well. Very tough hair cutting machine. I look forward to many years with these. There a bit expensive at little over a hundred dollars but well worth it. In time they will pay off them self. Compared to those cheap local store brands we buy all the time. Its better paying the extra money and your good to go. Good quality rugged barber shop machine which I purchased for home use. Great bye!</li>
            <li> I groom my own poodle and had an oster detachabe blade clipper for 25 years and finally it seems to be heating up a lot, so I purchased another one..The blades I have are a tiny bit larger on the attachable point, but they work quite well.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product and if it lives as long as my old one does, I will be estatic</li>
            <li> I have been using several big box retail specials up until now to shave my head. Some of them worked fairly well, but ultimately broke down from overuse. This looks and feels like it will outlast me. Time will only tell. The triple aught blade gets nice and close and the strong motor cuts down the time it takes me to shave my head by 1/4.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these clippers.  They are the best he has ever had.  His only gripe about them is that the advertised plastic blades that they often sell along with these don&#x27;t fit the blade very well.  He had to go out and buy the steel blades (which are more expensive; ~$25 each).</li>
            <li> I will preface my statement by saying I love my Oster clippers and blades. What I am most unhappy about is Amazon allowing false advertising of the products they sell on their web site (this in spite of the fact that you have been notified a number of times in the reviews on your web site that the products received were not as they were described). You are advertising that your Oster blade for these clippers have a Agion coating, which is false. None of the blades I was sent have this coating (I brought 8 blades) and I found out after receiving the non Agion blades that Oster no longer uses this coating on their blades for about a year now. In spite of that fact, you are falsely advertising that the blades you are selling do have the Agion coating and I am very surprised that a reputable company like Amazon would allow this extensive false advertising to continue! You advertise on probably half of all of your Oster blades as having the Agion coating, when you know that they don&#x27;t. Shame on you Amazon!</li>
            <li> When you spend the money on a quality product it really pays! My son cannot say enough good things about this clipper. This is truly a professional hair clipper! Also it is easy to handle and control and when you turn it on you can hear the expert craftsmanship that went into building this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a backup for my previous Oster Classic 76 I got 6 years ago.  The old one still works like a charm.  I use this to cut my hair as well as my two kids.  I will definitely buy again if the need ever arises.  I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ares E.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift.  The recipient loves it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> This replaced my twenty six years old 76&#x27;s that finally died on me.  Good product for working pros in the business.</li>
            <li> After finally giving in and admitting I was losing the hair battle I realized it was buzz cuts all over from here on out till I take a dirt nap. Needless to say I have been buzz cutting my whole head for about 3 years now. I used a Whal to do the job all that time with decent success but I was constantly buzz cutting twice a week and I thought...I need to save me some time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Google \\&quot;best hair clippers\\&quot; and bang...Oster Classic 76 comes up...I am shocked at that price tag...but boy is it worth it. Just used them today for the first time. Came with a 000 blade- very impressed. Powerful and best of all quick...no second runs through the hair...just does the job. After reading other reviews about the 0000 blade I just ordered that to save even more time between cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oster- great job, great product looks like this meat axe of a clipper will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Been cutting my own hair for 20+ years, I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get these.  I took a wetstone to the sharp edge of the blade so it doesn&#x27;t catch skin but I think I have a strange way I use them.  Probably not a problem for most.  Built incredibly well, USA made too.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a heavy duty clipper BUT not a commercial one.  This hair clipper should last a person&#x27;s life span.  I have used it twice and each time it performed flawlessly.  I have had to learn new ways to hold it in my hands and for the hard to reach spots my darling bride of 52 years was able to cut my hair.  I use the blade size 00000 for all of my head and cut it down to an almost bare scape.</li>
            <li> Great clipper.  From the photo it looked to me like this was a metal casing and it isn&#x27;t,  it&#x27;s silver plastic.  Otherwise, great item.</li>
            <li> Good buy, it really works perfectly as advertised. Furthermore, Amazon really offers the best price in market. I&#x27;ll buy again anytime.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Xmas. He cuts his hair 2-3 times a week and has been using this for a few years now. He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Cuts through your wiry weave like a knife through butter.</li>
            <li> Love it.Very good professional.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly as described on web page. Works great, no problems at all. Can&#x27;t use it enough! This is one item i do recommend!</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed with these clippers, i cut my own hair and have for years now and these are by far the best clippers ever</li>
            <li> Great clipper but the on off switch broke off after a few months of owning it</li>
            <li> Beautiful product, this Oster classic limited edition looks really great and works perfect. A little bit heavier than expected, but works very well. Thanks OSTER.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this clipper. The shape is ergonomically awkward like cutting hair with a flashlight. It&#x27;s a decent tool but I prefer the Wahl.</li>
            <li> Sorry but I&#x27;m not happy with this set of clippers.  I&#x27;m considering sending them back. This is my  3rd set and this particular clipper doesn&#x27;t remove the hair well. It&#x27;s seems to skip over some of the hair and leaves long pieces. Not happy .</li>
            <li> This is the trimmer for all your hairs.  Powerful.</li>
            <li> These clippers are a classic. They are very precise and made with high-quality. I highly recommended them. I use them every day. They will lose lubrication and get extremely hot if you use them for extended periods of time. You will have keep them properly cleaned an lubricated to ensure they continue to perform well. You have to actively maintenance them but when take care of they will reward you.</li>
            <li> Dissapoinment to say the least.....looked great when I got it... the minute I put a blade on and started a cut you can tell this clipper is junk the blade wobbled all around, I tried several different blades, new ones , old ones...and too just the weight and the feel of it is all wrong.....I own, 2 salons and I always have the Oster 76 in my men&#x27;s full service salon....I got this one because it says &amp;#34;Limited Edition&amp;#34;..... its limited because its garbage.</li>
            <li> This is a tremendously good product. Works perfectly. Runs quiet. Cuts smoothly and quickly. No tools to change blades. Long cord. Solid construction. I plan to keep and use it for many many years to come.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace an old Oster clipper and found this new one to be very heavy duty and professional, though a bit large and heavy. It takes a bunch of attachments. We even tried to shave our pet with this one. Though it has the fire power, I think we would have needed a pet specific attachment.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper and it was a great price here. It&#x27;s strong, powerful and lasts a long time. It&#x27;s also easy to clean and change blades. I dropped this and broke the switch but found that parts are easily available and easy to fit. Love this clipper!</li>
