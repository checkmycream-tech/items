    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best hair iron that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I was impressed by this product.</li>
            <li>For me, this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Great straightener with perfect heat!</li>
            <li>I use this product quite often and it works really good!</li>
            <li>It always gave great results.</li>
            <li>The positives outweigh them greatly which is why it still gets 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best straightener I own.</li>
            <li>Great value for the price..</li>
            <li>told me that her daughter used it and loved it.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I had one since kind of 6 years and it is still working, then I decided to buy one more as a gift.</li>
            <li>am in love with this brand.</li>
            <li>and it was much better.</li>
            <li>I saw this on Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and it was about $15 more</li>
            <li>and I was left very impressed.</li>
            <li>Better then</li>
            <li>Everyone at work always tells me your hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure flat-ironing pros will have an easier time.</li>
            <li>This has to be, without a doubt, the BEST flat iron I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>In 2013 I advised a new stylist that it would be a great investment</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of using this, you can iron your hair quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed frizz free hair for 2 weeks after I used it.</li>
            <li>This iron smooths it all out in an instant beautifully.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>So I bought it and was excited to use it</li>
            <li>I love love love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much that after almost 4 years it stop working</li>
            <li>More importantly, it doesn&#x27;t give your hair that \\&quot;burnt hair\\&quot; smell most flat irons give you.</li>
            <li>I LOVED this flat iron!</li>
            <li>It sort of ripped my hair out also and it made my hair SUPER staticy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more challenging to do with this larger iron.    </li>
            <li>I will not buy any more high priced irons.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>and I was happy with the results though it would take 2 hours for me to finish because even on the highest setting, each tiny section would need more than 1 pass of the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have tried them all and this by far is my favorite and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>, I just turned it on and it was almost instantly hot.</li>
            <li>I am so glad a took a chance on this flat iron.      </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>so I decided to really try to get the best product without being extremely expensive.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I have long hair</li>
            <li>and I love how much heat this flat iron has.</li>
            <li>This is just as good, if not, better than Chi, I have used them before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few flat irons, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>and it gets hot enough to make it smooth and silky without burning it.  </li>
            <li>You certainly get the \\&quot;bang for your buck\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I purchased it from Sally&#x27;s on sale for $39.99 and didn&#x27;t expect much for that price.  </li>
            <li>I would bend it a bit so that my ends weren&#x27;t stick straight.  </li>
            <li>Very recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This flat iron turned out to be far better than my Chi.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot making flat ironing my hair much quicker and easier to do!</li>
            <li>Note: You do need to use about 2-3\\&quot; sections to get the best results and the only complaint I have is that it does snag some hair when you have larger sections.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works far better than my old conair (which it should, for the price!).</li>
            <li>It even went abroad to New Zealand with me for 8 months!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m off to Sally&#x27;s to purchase a new one tomorrow!</li>
            <li>With this flat iron I can use more hair and it is silky straight in only 1 pass, even without being on the highest temperature.    </li>
            <li>That one was the same price as this one and it worked A TON better and it was the same type.</li>
            <li>I have worn out may flat irons in my day and this one is better than even one I paid almost double for.</li>
            <li>Plus, it barely straightened and didn&#x27;t leave it as smooth as the Jilbere does which usually only takes about 25-30 min.</li>
            <li>That one was a hot shot tools blue one</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on one of those super expensive ones, like Chi, this one is so nice!</li>
            <li>My old flat iron made my hair straight in just 2 times going through it</li>
            <li>Honestly I was shocked at how quickly it heated up</li>
            <li>major downside is that I keep getting my hair snagged at the end of the iron.</li>
            <li>It was over 5 years old and was used on a DAILY basis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that the edges of the Jilbere snag my hair if I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li>I bought this iron 4 years ago and it just barely stopped working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 3+ years and this flat iron gives me results a relaxer would.  </li>
            <li>My old flat iron gave out</li>
            <li>It works pretty well except for the fact that the paddles are smaller in length then the previous Remington l had.</li>
            <li>So, naturally, I purchased a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly, thick hair that I straighten/style daily.</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally curly hair, very coarse.</li>
            <li>I have thick, long multiethnic hair and this cuts through all the bulk to leave it flowing and smooth as glass with zero damage.</li>

            <li> I have thick, long multiethnic hair and this cuts through all the bulk to leave it flowing and smooth as glass with zero damage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron in 2007 from Sally Beauty and just 3 days ago it finally quit working.</li>
            <li> Granted, I dry my hair with a round brush to straighten it as much as possible without frying it, but this flat iron REALLY gets to the roots.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron to replace a Remington</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and I blow dry it and then flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy and extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, because it gets very hot, and it can be a little uncomfortable if it gets too close to your scalp on a high setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope that this one lasts as long!</li>
            <li> , i have very long hair</li>
            <li> Just like one other reviewer, I received this flat iron in 2007 and it just quit on me.</li>
            <li> It took almost an hour because it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough and because I had to use 1\\&quot; little sections to get the job done.</li>
            <li> When I do the front and sides of my hair, I can avoid this by being careful about how I place the iron on my hair (don&#x27;t \\&quot;slide\\&quot; it in--EVER).</li>
            <li> Other than that it seems comparable.</li>
            <li> Recently, my poor Jilbere Titanium Tool flat iron FINALLY bit the dust.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick hair</li>
            <li> It felt very rough on my hair and not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> If this one ever breaks or someone asks for a suggestion I would tell them to buy this product hands down!</li>
            <li> I bought a few years ago from Walmart for about $40.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never managed to use this without losing a few hairs.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not a huge fan of that.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a chi or babyliss, buy this one!</li>
            <li> 3 inches past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 1.5 inch Solia for the past 3 years</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when it stopped working, Walmart no longer carried the same model.</li>
            <li> I have a 1\\&quot; HAI that I usually use for my bangs and to curl the front of my hair.</li>
            <li> I only used Chi products and I was skeptical of this brand name.</li>
            <li> my expensive flat iron that cost me $150.00.</li>
            <li> but it went all wrong.</li>
            <li> and it was lousy.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to \\&quot;bump\\</li>
            <li> This product is really bad.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this straightener.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it so much that after almost 4 years it stop working and I bough it here again, i have very long hair and I love how much heat this flat iron has.</li>
            <li> Recently, my poor Jilbere Titanium Tool flat iron FINALLY bit the dust. It was over 5 years old and was used on a DAILY basis. It even went abroad to New Zealand with me for 8 months! So, naturally, I purchased a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly, thick hair that I straighten/style daily. Granted, I dry my hair with a round brush to straighten it as much as possible without frying it, but this flat iron REALLY gets to the roots. Not only that, but it almost doubles as a curling iron because I can flip my ends as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this brand. You certainly get the \\&quot;bang for your buck\\&quot;. I hope that this one lasts as long!</li>
            <li> I love love love this flat iron.  I have very thick, long, curly hair and it gets hot enough to make it smooth and silky without burning it.  I have worn out may flat irons in my day and this one is better than even one I paid almost double for.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly! Very fast shipping! I use this product quite often and it works really good! It gets very hot making flat ironing my hair much quicker and easier to do! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron in 2007 from Sally Beauty and just 3 days ago it finally quit working. I used it probably 4-6 days out of the week, sometimes twice a day. I have long, naturally curly hair, very coarse. I LOVED this flat iron! It always gave great results. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a chi or babyliss, buy this one! I have tried them all and this by far is my favorite and reasonably priced. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This product is really bad. I bought it at Sally Beauty Shop and the lady that worked there told me that her daughter used it and loved it. So I bought it and was excited to use it but it went all wrong. It felt very rough on my hair and not smooth at all. It sort of ripped my hair out also and it made my hair SUPER staticy. My last straightener that I had, I got that one from the same place and it was much better. That one was a hot shot tools blue one and it was titanium. That one was the same price as this one and it worked A TON better and it was the same type. My old flat iron made my hair straight in just 2 times going through it wheras this one it took me a loonnnggg time to straighten it the way I like it. I would NOT recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have long hair and I can straighten it within 10 mins with the 2 inch!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick hair 3 inches past my shoulders.  I do not have a relaxer or chemicals in my hair.  I&#x27;ve been natural for 3+ years and this flat iron gives me results a relaxer would.  I&#x27;ve been using the 1.5 inch Solia for the past 3 years and I was happy with the results though it would take 2 hours for me to finish because even on the highest setting, each tiny section would need more than 1 pass of the flat iron.  With this flat iron I can use more hair and it is silky straight in only 1 pass, even without being on the highest temperature.    I purchased it from Sally&#x27;s on sale for $39.99 and didn&#x27;t expect much for that price.  I took a chance with this one because of the 2.5 inch plates.  I knew I had 60 days to return it so I had nothing to lose.  I am so glad a took a chance on this flat iron.      A couple negatives:    It is very difficult to \\&quot;bump\\&quot; my ends.  I would bend it a bit so that my ends weren&#x27;t stick straight.  I curled them under with my smaller Solia.  It&#x27;s a bit more challenging to do with this larger iron.    It also snags my hair on the edge of the iron.  The Solia didn&#x27;t do that.      I can work with the negatives.  The positives outweigh them greatly which is why it still gets 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair iron that I have tried. Very recommended. I had one since kind of 6 years and it is still working, then I decided to buy one more as a gift.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron to replace a Remington I bought a few years ago from Walmart for about $40. Unfortunately when it stopped working, Walmart no longer carried the same model. I saw this on Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and it was about $15 more so l got this one from Amazon. It works pretty well except for the fact that the paddles are smaller in length then the previous Remington l had. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the edges of the Jilbere snag my hair if I&#x27;m not careful so I&#x27;m not a huge fan of that. Other than that it seems comparable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few flat irons, but this one is by far the best. I bought it when I went away to college, and it served me for 7 years. It never \\&quot;caught\\&quot; my hair or frizzed it or anything. Don&#x27;t waste your money on one of those super expensive ones, like Chi, this one is so nice!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used it on me in 2010 and I was left very impressed. In 2013 I advised a new stylist that it would be a great investment and she has not turned back either. I have thick, long multiethnic hair and this cuts through all the bulk to leave it flowing and smooth as glass with zero damage. I enjoyed frizz free hair for 2 weeks after I used it. Quite a testimony to its performance!</li>
            <li> For the 2\\&quot;.I bought this iron 4 years ago and it just barely stopped working. I bought it for about $65 and it&#x27;s the best straightener I own. I have a 1\\&quot; HAI that I usually use for my bangs and to curl the front of my hair. When the Jilbere broke, I had to use this one to straighten all my hair and it was lousy. It took almost an hour because it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough and because I had to use 1\\&quot; little sections to get the job done. Plus, it barely straightened and didn&#x27;t leave it as smooth as the Jilbere does which usually only takes about 25-30 min. to straighten all my hair. Note: You do need to use about 2-3\\&quot; sections to get the best results and the only complaint I have is that it does snag some hair when you have larger sections.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by this product. Better then my expensive flat iron that cost me $150.00. It also gives my hair shine. Everyone at work always tells me your hair looks healthy. I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> My old flat iron gave out so I decided to really try to get the best product without being extremely expensive. This has to be, without a doubt, the BEST flat iron I have ever owned! This is just as good, if not, better than Chi, I have used them before. Honestly I was shocked at how quickly it heated up, I just turned it on and it was almost instantly hot. More importantly, it doesn&#x27;t give your hair that \\&quot;burnt hair\\&quot; smell most flat irons give you. If this one ever breaks or someone asks for a suggestion I would tell them to buy this product hands down!</li>
            <li> Great straightener with perfect heat! I highly recommend it! Great value for the price..you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this straightener.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works far better than my old conair (which it should, for the price!). I have curly hair, and I blow dry it and then flat iron it. Once you get the hang of using this, you can iron your hair quickly and effectively. Just be careful, because it gets very hot, and it can be a little uncomfortable if it gets too close to your scalp on a high setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major downside is that I keep getting my hair snagged at the end of the iron. When I do the front and sides of my hair, I can avoid this by being careful about how I place the iron on my hair (don&#x27;t \\&quot;slide\\&quot; it in--EVER). But it can be tricky in the back. I&#x27;ve never managed to use this without losing a few hairs. But I&#x27;m sure flat-ironing pros will have an easier time.</li>
            <li> My mother in law gave me this because someone left it at her house. I only used Chi products and I was skeptical of this brand name. This flat iron turned out to be far better than my Chi. I have very wavy and extremely thick hair. This iron smooths it all out in an instant beautifully. Just like one other reviewer, I received this flat iron in 2007 and it just quit on me. I&#x27;m off to Sally&#x27;s to purchase a new one tomorrow! I will not buy any more high priced irons. For me, this one is the best.</li>
