            <li>I have several Tweezerman tweezers - they are the best!</li>
            <li>I love that the company will sharpen them at anytime for free.  </li>
            <li>Nice color is fun also</li>
            <li>The package came very quickly, well wrapped with a Thank</li>
            <li>Great tweezer and definitely better quality than your regular supermarket beauty aisle fare as reflected in the cost.</li>
            <li>I find they are easy to shape and tweeze with this brand.  </li>
            <li>So precise.  </li>
            <li>The spring back is great as well.  </li>
            <li>You note, which made me smile......!</li>
            <li>This is a top quality product, would highly recommend this brand to anyone!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about Tweezerman, so I decided to try something different this time around.  </li>
            <li>These are seriously the best.  </li>
            <li>It really makes it easy to pluck eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Good slant; easy to get those little eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have an old one I have for years, and it&#x27;s still working great, but we needed a second one.&lt;br /&gt;Very dependable and gets anything out you need out!</li>
            <li>They are aligned properly and have a nice grip to them.  </li>
            <li>and so far this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>keep it up for sure I&#x27;ll buy more in other colors</li>
            <li>The tension is just right</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Wish I had bought them years ago--would&#x27;ve saved me so much time and energy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My aged Sephora tweezers do a better job.</li>
            <li>Although they are so good, I am willing to dish out a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li>Brand new ones rock!</li>
            <li>if you have older skin-</li>
            <li>They are my go-to company for high quality tweezers.</li>
            <li>The product is not so sharp, however, that you could hurt yourself too easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many different tweezers over the years (even other Tweezerman styles)</li>
            <li>like me - its easy to get a bit of skin trapped in the tip of these.</li>
            <li>They do seem better than average at specific stubborn hair removal.</li>
            <li>wow, what a difference when I use these, you don&#x27;t even need a mirror</li>
            <li>Had to replace one many years old, but only because I misplaced it, not because it didn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li>These tweezers grab their target the first time, so you don&#x27;t end up damaging your skin or leaving red areas from multiple attempts.</li>
            <li>Only used once so far.  </li>
            <li>My first I purchased a few years ago and my husband took them.</li>

            <li> very sharp, you can return them to the company for sharpening at no charge.  </li>
            <li> and they are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> The tips are very sharp, so handle with care.</li>
            <li> but much less often.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll keep them pulling every little hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> I only use it for my eyebrows, and unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t work well for this.  </li>
            <li> Eh, I am not impressed.  </li>

            <li> be careful. these are very sharp. if you have older skin- like me - its easy to get a bit of skin trapped in the tip of these. have done this several times now. ugh</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works good with magnifying mirror.  The previous sharp one I bought was too pointed for what I used it for.</li>
            <li> A little sharp but grabs anything</li>
            <li> Tweezerman in my opinion is a Great product. I will not use anything else. Good quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li> this tweezers is a amazing!  best purchase you could ever buy.  you could split atoms with the precision and accuracy of these tweezers!</li>
            <li> very sharp, you can return them to the company for sharpening at no charge.  Great product!!!  I buy this brand every time.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever! Wish I had bought them years ago--would&#x27;ve saved me so much time and energy.

            <li> This is a top quality product, would highly recommend this brand to anyone!  The package came very quickly, well wrapped with a Thank You note, which made me smile......!</li>
            <li> very good clamp even loved it served me well thank you. keep it up for sure I&#x27;ll buy more in other colors</li>
            <li> great as they always are. Love this brand. Had to replace one many years old, but only because I misplaced it, not because it didn&#x27;t hold up. Love the Purple color too!</li>
            <li> Only used once so far.  They do seem better than average at specific stubborn hair removal.</li>
            <li> They work, but not as I want them to or would expect them to at $16. Tore more skin then eyebrow hairs out, and it&#x27;s difficult to grab finer hairs. Packaging looks legitimate enough and the tweezers look quality but maybe I got gypped...</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great! They get even the teeniest pesky stub of hair! They are nice, pretty and sturdy and work amazingly well! Tweezerman tweezers never disappoint!</li>
            <li> Keep the tip cover and they will last forever</li>
            <li> These tweezers are the best I have ever found at a reasonable price.  I have an old one I have for years, and it&#x27;s still working great, but we needed a second one.&lt;br /&gt;Very dependable and gets anything out you need out!</li>
            <li> These are seriously the best.  So precise.  It really makes it easy to pluck eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I thought tweezers were tweezers. Bought mostly out of curiosity bc heard these were so good. Yep- they&#x27;re better than what I&#x27;d been buying. Will be a return customer. Plus love the color!</li>
            <li> wow, what a difference when I use these, you don&#x27;t even need a mirror it grabs everything</li>
            <li> The best tweezers ever! I thought buying several cheaper pair would be better, but boy I was wrong. These are very, very good considering the price. One note: protect the tips with the plastic cover they come with. It&#x27;ll keep them pulling every little hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes an excellent product and I love the color! They are my go-to company for high quality tweezers. And they will resharpen them!</li>
            <li> Excellent tweezer and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.  It works really good and has a really good grip.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really love these tweezers.  They are aligned properly and have a nice grip to them.  The spring back is great as well.  I&#x27;ve gone through many different tweezers over the years (even other Tweezerman styles) and so far this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tweezer to replace one I&#x27;ve had for years from Sephora.  My Sephora tweezers worked quite well, but probably just need to be sharpened.  I&#x27;ve heard good things about Tweezerman, so I decided to try something different this time around.  Eh, I am not impressed.  These tweezers break hairs rather than plucking them out--it&#x27;s pretty frustrating.  I only use it for my eyebrows, and unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t work well for this.  My aged Sephora tweezers do a better job.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers that I have purchased. You can get the short little hair that normal tweezers don&#x27;t get.This is my second pair. My first I purchased a few years ago and my husband took them. The one thing that puts me off is the price. Although they are so good, I am willing to dish out a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> Love the color too.  This is my third pair of Tweezermans (I&#x27;m hiding this one from the husband and daughter).  If yours doesn&#x27;t work, its lost its sharpness.  Brand new ones rock!</li>
            <li> This is easily the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.  The tension is just right and they are very sharp.  I love that the company will sharpen them at anytime for free.  I would recommended these tweezers to anyone except young girls as they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Love this company but this is really small so hard to grab. but great in my makeup bag in my purse for emergency</li>
            <li> Great! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have several Tweezerman tweezers - they are the best!</li>
            <li> Awesome and very precise!</li>
            <li> Great tweezer and definitely better quality than your regular supermarket beauty aisle fare as reflected in the cost. Works perfectly out of the box.</li>
            <li> These are amazing tweezers -- I have them in two colors!  I would recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> I lost my Tweezerman tweezers and am replacing them.  Once you have had them nothing compares to them! Great product.</li>
            <li> These arrived in a nice package.  They make it easier to get the job done.  The tips are very sharp, so handle with care.</li>
            <li> I have always found this brand to be the best tweezers.  Good slant; easy to get those little eyebrow hairs.  Sometimes, I have my eyebrows threaded but much less often.  I find they are easy to shape and tweeze with this brand.  I think it is a near perfect product and the price is right.</li>
