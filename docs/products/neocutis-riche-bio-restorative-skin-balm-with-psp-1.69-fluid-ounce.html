            <li>The best cream ever!!!  </li>
            <li>the best cream ever!!!!</li>
            <li>excellent product!</li>
            <li>works very good best price</li>
            <li>After I started using Neocutis Skin Balm friends kept telling me how rested and great I looked.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for night time use along with day time under my sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I would be happy to pose for a before/after photograph.  </li>
            <li>It is non greasy, unscented and good for the skin.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with neoriche skin balm and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Now my skin looks amazing and I&#x27;m not broke.</li>
            <li>hoping because the PSP part is effective.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this, have been using it for 8 years.</li>
            <li>It is even more cost efficient to get it on line so now buy on Amazon to get much better prices.</li>
            <li>I have discovered for more than one reason, I am not a fan of Neocutis products.</li>
            <li>Neocutis is my favorite skin care line.</li>
            <li>If I need moisture or a barrier, it won&#x27;t be Petrolatum or Mineral Oil and then pay through the nose for inferior cheap fillers like those!</li>
            <li>I first got this at my dermatologist&#x27;s and loved it - it works so much better than anything you can get at any department store</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and my skin feels and looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this product originally from my dermatologist, and wanted to replace when it ran out.  </li>
            <li>Saw it on your website with the picture and name matching the original.  </li>
            <li>Water is the first ingredient and Vaseline!</li>
            <li>absorbs immediately; feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li>Love this product, having been using for years, pricey but worth the rich day long moisture, without the greasiness</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I can buy it here, and save money doing it!</li>
            <li>I love this cream but the last one I received was defective.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly and performs as well as company literature</li>
            <li>Good hydration for sensitive skin, during dry winter months or post-procedure, after retin-A etc.</li>
            <li>Also the balm does not feel nearly as moisturizing as the original one.  </li>
            <li>And yes, I do use dysport/botox and filler, but very sparingly.</li>
            <li>(after all it is prescription grade) plus it does not cost as much as all those creams in the stores.</li>
            <li>Firm, fresh, dewy skin (in your 50&#x27;s) takes a lot more than slathering on some overpriced skin cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I will even get to use the whole bottle or if the bottle was even filled full.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer starts off fine, but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me and considering how much it cost.  </li>
            <li>Really makes a difference in my skin which is dry from the sun and from just getting older.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m stuck with it, but next time I know to open and use right away.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a whole other post!</li>

            <li> Good hydration for sensitive skin, during dry winter months or post-procedure, after retin-A etc. Expensive, but I haven&#x27;t found a reasonably priced alternative. I use it sparingly and only when my skin is too irritated for any other moisturizer. Don&#x27;t know if I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The best cream ever!!!  Way cheaper online then at the doctors office!  Thanks so much!! the best cream ever!!!! You must try it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Cannot go without it.</li>
            <li> Not the same product as shown in picture.  I had purchased this product originally from my dermatologist, and wanted to replace when it ran out.  Saw it on your website with the picture and name matching the original.  When I received it, it was definitely in different packaging.  Also the balm does not feel nearly as moisturizing as the original one.  Would be afraid to reorder for fear it would be the same.</li>
            <li> I could not live without this product.  I was introduced by my dermatologist and started using it after chemical peel sessions. I soon realized that I like to use it after washing my face anytime before I add the sunscreen or makeup.  It is non greasy, unscented and good for the skin.  I add a night cream over this in the evening.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for YEARS (on the advice of a botox dr.) and my skin continued to age--horribly. I finally wised up and started using a Vitamin C serum and tablets, Phytoceramides capsules, Collagen Capsules, a Baby Quasar and occasionally My-M skin needling device. Now my skin looks amazing and I&#x27;m not broke. (One of my neighbors even asked me recently,  if I&#x27;d had a facelift). Firm, fresh, dewy skin (in your 50&#x27;s) takes a lot more than slathering on some overpriced skin cream. And yes, I do use dysport/botox and filler, but very sparingly.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with neoriche skin balm and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this, have been using it for 8 years. I always get compliments on my skin! Thanks to Amazon, I can buy it here, and save money doing it!</li>
            <li> absorbs immediately; feel the difference right away. excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is the Cadillac of face moisturizers. Really makes a difference in my skin which is dry from the sun and from just getting older. I used to spend thousands on department store creams until I found Neocutis. I first got this at my dermatologist&#x27;s and loved it - it works so much better than anything you can get at any department store (after all it is prescription grade) plus it does not cost as much as all those creams in the stores. After I started using Neocutis Skin Balm friends kept telling me how rested and great I looked.  It is even more cost efficient to get it on line so now buy on Amazon to get much better prices.</li>
            <li> Love this product, having been using for years, pricey but worth the rich day long moisture, without the greasiness</li>

            <li> works very good best price</li>
            <li> I love this cream but the last one I received was defective.  I didn&#x27;t open it until after the return window so I&#x27;m stuck with it, but next time I know to open and use right away.  The pump pumps air which tells me there is something wrong with the package and that either air was packaged in it or air is leaking into it.  Either way, I have air in my product which probably means it is degrading or degraded already. I have to keep pumping to get anything to come out.  I&#x27;m not sure I will even get to use the whole bottle or if the bottle was even filled full.  It&#x27;s expensive, so make sure to open and try immediately!!!</li>
            <li> Neocutis is my favorite skin care line. It&#x27;s great for night time use along with day time under my sunscreen. My make up glows when I use BioCream too...another added perk. I&#x27;ve used this now for 3 years and will never switch. It helps with overall appearance, texture, and tone with my skin.</li>
            <li> I got this product after a facial peel and have used ever since. It goes on so smooth and my skin feels and looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I have used this for almost a year and has replaced the necessity for any injections  around the eye area. It does exactly and performs as well as company literature and I would be happy to pose for a before/after photograph.  And the results are permanent!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times and it is only 1/10 th gone and the pump broke so I have no way to get the rest of the $94.00 product out,  any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Water is the first ingredient and Vaseline! is the 3rd ingredient. I think other products in their line leave out Vaseline....hoping because the PSP part is effective.  If I need moisture or a barrier, it won&#x27;t be Petrolatum or Mineral Oil and then pay through the nose for inferior cheap fillers like those! Research it yourself! On one site-&lt;br /&gt;Jones â€“ Because weâ€™re dealing with a multi-billion pound industry and mineral oils are leftovers from the production of petrol and oil. A little known fact is that itâ€™s cheaper to put this stuff (ie Vaseline) into beauty products than to chuck away. Theyâ€™re not going to spread that around are they â€“ pardon the pun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also add Propylene Glycol which is toxic as well but that&#x27;s a whole other post!</li>
