            <li>This lotion is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I have fair to light skin, and it worked well on me!</li>
            <li>I liked the color it immediately gave me but not the smell.</li>
            <li>it gives me a nice brown tan never orange.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminded me of mothballs.</li>
            <li>I try to more than once make it looks good</li>
            <li>can you tell me what you did to make it looks nice</li>
            <li>The new improved product now does not have this odor so now it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>the good news is that it comes out of the clothes rather easily, unlike some brands.  </li>
            <li>Very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the best self tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t ever use anything else,  this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>knees or elbows, lightly, VERY lightly glaze over...</li>
            <li>It looks nice and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor to it.</li>
            <li>The day after application is usually better as I have showered and rinsed off the residue that may come off on clothing the day of application.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Way better product.</li>
            <li>Ha :)</li>
            <li>I love it and am now a customer.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>This smell is kind of like light tree bark smell that is easily covered with your favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>You get a beautiful natural looking brown tan.</li>
            <li>What does come off onto clothing washes out easily.</li>
            <li>But washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t stain the sheets.</li>
            <li>i love the color guide its easy to apply no streaking and gives you a bronze look right away plus its cheap!</li>
            <li>I took a cue from a previous review and apply the lotion at night which works best.  </li>
            <li>Apply once for just a little color or two nights in a row to get an awesome tan.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice transition and looks more natural</li>
            <li>It does stink a bit but its worth the stink :-)</li>
            <li>Enjoy..</li>
            <li>I am pale and this is the greatest color.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a very golden non-orange color.</li>
            <li>I just saw the box there and knew it was unique.</li>
            <li>I had got this many years ago when it was just a &amp;#34;seen on tv&amp;#34; it really does give you a tanned look.</li>
            <li>Love this product and with real results of a natural tan also..!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it because it lasts for about a week and you look brown not orange.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years to give me that nice golden tan without actually sitting in the sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and love it even though I was not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural, and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>best thing about this product is no orange after effect or weird fading issue.</li>
            <li>It has its own smell but doesn&#x27;t have the yucky lingering urine smell that other self - tanners have.</li>
            <li>usually shower before I put the lotion on and scrub my body really good (or where I plan to put the lotion).</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to everyone out there whos trying to find the right sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>As with any tanning lotion, I do not recommend applying, then wearing light color clothes the same day.  </li>
            <li>And so very inexpensive compared to others that aren&#x27;t as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed that I always seem to smooth out the back of knees and with the color guide (brown color)</li>
            <li>I use it all year round to keep my nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also depends on how many times you&#x27;ve applied it and how dark you like to be.</li>
            <li>I really bought this because of all the great reviews I normally use fake bake  </li>
            <li>Way easy to apply, natural color,  and lasts long.  </li>
            <li>I can handle the orange, it&#x27;s better than my natural pale skin, but to my surprise I woke up with a REAL tan!  </li>
            <li>I am a pretty fair-skinned girl and was kinda scared of coming out looking super dark.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Especially knees and elbows)applied a moisturizing lotion to those areas first</li>
            <li>Looks totally natural!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will keep purchasing this product for as long as I can and as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I llike the natural tan</li>
            <li>Make sure you leave it on for at least 3 hours though and avoid the pool.</li>
            <li>and this is SO natural looking, not orange at all.  </li>
            <li>I also like how natural the ingredients are in the product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and looks so natural.</li>
            <li>While this lotion is very dark right when you apply it, it is also very oily and my skin feels greasy after i apply it</li>
            <li>the dry skin will absorb 3X as much color as well-moisturized parts.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a product that works immediately and last for several days.  </li>
            <li>I look like I have a very natural, brown tan that is NOT overbearing but is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>It is also VERY thick and kind of clumpy, to the the lotion from the bottom of the bottle i actually had to cut the bottle open.</li>
            <li>product is a thick dark brown lotion of sort that spreads on very easily.</li>
            <li>I think the price is very similiar, if not less, than what I would pay for a retail sunless item, but seems to last a little longer.</li>

            <li> I mix one part tanner with one part jergens natural glow to tone it down,  </li>
            <li> put this on at night and wear loose sleeping pants and a big shirt</li>
            <li> I used to use tanning beds up until a few years ago because I wanted that natural brown bronze color.</li>
            <li> and it took a while before i felt dry again.</li>
            <li> I feel like when my skin is dry, it soaks up the tanning lotion</li>
            <li> Instant color and dark brown never orange.</li>
            <li> If you have any rough patches of skin...</li>
            <li> this made me extremely orange  </li>
            <li> The dark brown color is to check if there are any streaks that need to be blended in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lotions in the past like Loreal and Neurtrogena</li>
            <li> I had skin cancer a few years ago &amp; am the QUEEN of sunless tanner: airbrush, Versa, &amp; all of the bottled/</li>
            <li> the lotion came on unevenly</li>
            <li> I stopped using the tanning beds b/c of the health risks and have tried a few self-tanners and none of them &#x27;wowed&#x27; me.</li>
            <li> cause i work out everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with natural looking self tans and have tried everything you can think of.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a lot of the self tanners over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> but it is very difficult to keep it on for such a long period.</li>
            <li> and I have three small children</li>
            <li> I usually shower again just to rinse off the color guide so it doesn&#x27;t get on any of my clothes.</li>
            <li> I usually will apply it two days in a row to get to the color</li>
            <li> It is rather thick and sometimes difficult to get out of the bottle - but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so was hard to find the time.</li>
            <li> No way,  Color streaky, not a good color, and I just don&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t smell bad like a lot of self tanners.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure whether this bottle I purchased  was old or what , but it was very very thick and had a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> Sorry Tomas.</li>
            <li> I was going spray tanning but was expensive and had to go so often</li>
            <li> Sorry Tomas your just not for me.</li>
            <li> and I always turned a shade of orange or it faded in weird spots</li>
            <li> The lotion is very sloppy.</li>
            <li> Smells bad</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad either .</li>
            <li> and  this is 1 of the worst fake tan I have ever used</li>
            <li> Disappointed!.</li>
            <li> it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t real bad either .</li>

            <li> I just got Toma&#x27;s self tanner yesterday to get an emergency tan for a date tonight!!  I had skin cancer a few years ago &amp; am the QUEEN of sunless tanner: airbrush, Versa, &amp; all of the bottled/can tan &amp; I love the color!  I can handle the orange, it&#x27;s better than my natural pale skin, but to my surprise I woke up with a REAL tan!  There were some rusty spots, but washed off in the shower.  My skin is also feels moisturizers, not sticky!  I will also be getting the rest of the line!</li>
            <li> I llike the natural tan this lotion gives me.  The day after application is usually better as I have showered and rinsed off the residue that may come off on clothing the day of application.  What does come off onto clothing washes out easily. It looks nice and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor to it.</li>
            <li> I had got this many years ago when it was just a &amp;#34;seen on tv&amp;#34; it really does give you a tanned look. I remember my grandmother yelling at me to stay away from the tanning beds. So if grandma couldn&#x27;t tell it was from a bottle, then you&#x27;re all set! It does however get all over everything. So be prepared. But washes out easily. It&#x27;s worth it because it lasts for about a week and you look brown not orange. I have fair to light skin, and it worked well on me!</li>
            <li> This has been my go to..tanner for the Last 20 years. It works great and tan looks good. It does stink a bit but its worth the stink :-)</li>
            <li> This stuff smells&lt;br /&gt;Awful!</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether this bottle I purchased  was old or what , but it was very very thick and had a horrible smell. I liked the color it immediately gave me but not the smell. Very strong chemical smell. Disappointed!.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and love it even though I was not crazy about the smell. The new improved product now does not have this odor so now it is perfect.  I am a redhead who has fair skin and it is perfect to put on legs just before you go out. Several of my co-workers asked what I use and they have begun using it.  Thanks for a product that works immediately and last for several days.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I used this tanner 15yrs ago when you had to order it from QVC. Didn&#x27;t  know it still existed until recently browsing at sally beauty. I am very fair n it gives me a nice brown tan never orange. I use it alone or to enhance my tan when I use the beds. Smells bad but it&#x27;s a smallcon for a terrific product!</li>
            <li> I like it but it is very difficult to keep it on for such a long period. There needs to be an easier way to apply it. The lotion is very sloppy.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and it&#x27;s amazing. The tan guide helps to ensure you don&#x27;t miss any spots and it&#x27;s a very golden non-orange color. Apply once for just a little color or two nights in a row to get an awesome tan. I recommend using a tanning mit!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product,luva this :-)</li>
            <li> Love this product and with real results of a natural tan also..!!!! The smell isn&#x27;t real bad either . I had great results with this tanner and I highly recommend it to everyone out there whos trying to find the right sunless tanner. Enjoy..</li>
            <li> This product really works. Very natural looking tan. Make sure you leave it on for at least 3 hours though and avoid the pool.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and this is SO natural looking, not orange at all.  It lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t smell bad like a lot of self tanners.  Please follow instructions and use the gloves; it is so easy and awesome.</li>
            <li> Perfect  ! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Perfect tan been using for years. Great value easy to use. Instant color and dark brown never orange. Smell isn&#x27;t bad either .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 15 years,  when you could only buy from infomercial.  I am pale and this is the greatest color.  I apply 2 times a week.  Also if I have an event and need color, I apply and ban, I&#x27;m tan. I have used everything and always go back to this.</li>
            <li> I like the spray version, but the lotion smelled absolutely horrible. I ended just throwing it away. It kind of reminded me of mothballs. Sorry Tomas. Just not a match for me personally.</li>
            <li> I really bought this because of all the great reviews I normally use fake bake  this made me extremely orange  the lotion came on unevenly I try to more than once make it looks good and  this is 1 of the worst fake tan I have ever used can you tell me what you did to make it looks can you tell me what you did to make it looks nice</li>
            <li> I used to use tanning beds up until a few years ago because I wanted that natural brown bronze color. I stopped using the tanning beds b/c of the health risks and have tried a few self-tanners and none of them &#x27;wowed&#x27; me. This lotion is simply amazing. Followed the instructions to the letter (you MUST exfoliate. Especially knees and elbows)applied a moisturizing lotion to those areas first and you MUST use the gloves. I am a pretty fair-skinned girl and was kinda scared of coming out looking super dark. I look like I have a very natural, brown tan that is NOT overbearing but is definitely noticeable. NO streaks, NO blotches, NO smell. Awesome stuff. I will recommend this to anyone seeking a sunless tanner. The best part besides the tan itself is the fact that it comes out brown. Genius! What sense does it make to have a self-tanner that comes out white? You can&#x27;t see where it goes and it WILL streak if you miss spots. This is awesome b/c you see exactly where it goes! If you have any rough patches of skin... knees or elbows, lightly, VERY lightly glaze over... the dry skin will absorb 3X as much color as well-moisturized parts. LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, I didn&#x27;t even buy this on Amazon lol but I just had to write a review!! I love it. I found it on another website and the reviews were all great so I decided to try it. Best self tan lotion EVER! No streaks or orange color. Looks totally natural! Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t stain the sheets. You get a beautiful natural looking brown tan. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using a lot of the self tanners over the past few years.  I took a cue from a previous review and apply the lotion at night which works best.  As with any tanning lotion, I do not recommend applying, then wearing light color clothes the same day.  the good news is that it comes out of the clothes rather easily, unlike some brands.  It is rather thick and sometimes difficult to get out of the bottle - but a little goes a long way.  I think the price is very similiar, if not less, than what I would pay for a retail sunless item, but seems to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion before i went to the beach. I have been self tanning for years,  i&#x27;ve tried it all. While this lotion is very dark right when you apply it, it is also very oily and my skin feels greasy after i apply it and it took a while before i felt dry again. It is also VERY thick and kind of clumpy, to the the lotion from the bottom of the bottle i actually had to cut the bottle open. I did not repurchase this and i wouldn&#x27;t, the color was alright but if i go into Sally Beauty supply then i am going to buy a bottle of Tanwise. Way better product.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best self tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  It looks so natural, and is easy to apply.  I use it once a week to maintain the tan.  No smell, and washes out of fabrics.  And so very inexpensive compared to others that aren&#x27;t as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this lotion. I was going spray tanning but was expensive and had to go so often cause i work out everyday and I have three small children so was hard to find the time. Toma&#x27;s tan perfect is so light feeling not oily or sticky i love the color guide its easy to apply no streaking and gives you a bronze look right away plus its cheap! One application is all you need I also like how natural the ingredients are in the product. THIS IS A MUST BUY !![[ASIN:B004TBOBEW Tomas Tan Perfect Self-Tanning Lotion]][[ASIN:B004TBOBEW Tomas Tan Perfect Self-Tanning Lotion]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with natural looking self tans and have tried everything you can think of.  I won&#x27;t ever use anything else,  this is by far the best.  Way easy to apply, natural color,  and lasts long.  I&#x27;m so happy that I found this and I&#x27;ve had tons of compliments on my tan,  even my husband couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how \\&quot;real\\&quot; my tan looked. Ha :) Oh and for my face I mix one part tanner with one part jergens natural glow to tone it down,  it&#x27;s a nice transition and looks more natural</li>
            <li> I use to use Clarin&#x27;s but thought with the reviews I would try this.  I used it 2 x&#x27;s just to see and give it a chance.  No way,  Color streaky, not a good color, and I just don&#x27;t care for it.  I now use Sublime by L&#x27;Oreal.  It&#x27;s perfect color, no streaking, Sorry Tomas your just not for me.</li>
            <li> I bought Toma&#x27;s self tanner at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. I just saw the box there and knew it was unique. It&#x27;s the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. I was born on the beach - believe that I&#x27;ve tried them all. This one doesn&#x27;t orange or streak. It doesn&#x27;t have fragrance. It has its own smell but doesn&#x27;t have the yucky lingering urine smell that other self - tanners have. This smell is kind of like light tree bark smell that is easily covered with your favorite lotion. I love it and am now a customer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion. I have been using it for years to give me that nice golden tan without actually sitting in the sun. I use it all year round to keep my nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product is no orange after effect or weird fading issue. I&#x27;ve tried other lotions in the past like Loreal and Neurtrogena and I always turned a shade of orange or it faded in weird spots and then I just look blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a thick dark brown lotion of sort that spreads on very easily. The dark brown color is to check if there are any streaks that need to be blended in. I noticed that I always seem to smooth out the back of knees and with the color guide (brown color) it helps me see if I missed rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually shower before I put the lotion on and scrub my body really good (or where I plan to put the lotion). Toma does have a body scrub, but you can use any body scrub. The best result is use a body scrub with no lotion or moisture additives. I feel like when my skin is dry, it soaks up the tanning lotion better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on at night and wear loose sleeping pants and a big shirt (this is so none of the color guide will get on my sheets). I wake up in the morning and I&#x27;m tan. I usually shower again just to rinse off the color guide so it doesn&#x27;t get on any of my clothes. You&#x27;ll see it come off in the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t take off your tan. If you want to be darker you can re-apply it. I usually only do that the next day since I like setting my tan in while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and the tan lasts about 7 days. It also depends on how many times you&#x27;ve applied it and how dark you like to be. I usually will apply it two days in a row to get to the color I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep purchasing this product for as long as I can and as long as it&#x27;s available. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best sunless tanner I have ever used. Doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and looks so natural. The color does rub off on clothes some though.</li>
