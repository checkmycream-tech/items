            <li> really nice and hi quality</li>
            <li> FRAGRANCE IF YOU LIKE IT SWEET SADLY VERY EXPENSIVE AND SEEMS THAT EVERY MONTH THE PRICE RISES A LITTLE BIT</li>
            <li> yummy..... smells like danger</li>
            <li> Boudoir has been my signature scent for years. I get plenty of compliments from men and women alike. It&#x27;s an exciting, sensual, powdery, scent with floral undertones. There is the original version which has a dark pink (almost brownish/orange at times), and then a later version which is light pink appearing more pastel in color. The difference in smell and wearability is night/day in my opinion. The original is a sensual, lingering, pleasant, longer-lasting scent. Whereas, the later version is powdery, short-lived, with undertones of grasses/herbs rather than florals which sent my allergies into a talespin! No matter which version, Boudoir is definitely not for everyone. You either love it or you hate it - there is no in between. Before you decide to get hooked on it - remember, the perfume has been discontinued and is VERY hard to find, and price will vary drastically.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years so glad to find it available for sale. I will continue to order</li>
            <li> Someone told me they I smelled &amp;#34; yummy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Most beautiful floral fragrance... Not too strong, but lasts and lasts remarkably long!</li>
            <li> Boudoir by Vivienne Westwood was first given to my by my husband.  I have loved it every since.  I also like Vivienne Westwood Libertine parfum but it is discontinued</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my most favorite perfume!  I loved how fast it got to me just 3 days before my birthday in late September.</li>
            <li> Had this many years ago. Glad I decided to try it again. Haven&#x27;t used anything else since purchasing this perfume</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful powdery scent that is not over powering. it&#x27;s fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite scents yes the color wasnt as pink as Im used to however the scent was fine at first I thought the scent was stale but after wearing it I do like it and have bought it before yet the color was peach worried me it was bad but it wasnt spoiled at all</li>
            <li> I have used this Eau de Parfum for many years.  It was discontinued probably 10 years ago and hard to find.  This particular one that I received has a different crown on top of the bottle and doesn&#x27;t quite smell how I remember.</li>
            <li> I have used Boudoir for YEARS!  I decided to try it from Amazon instead of my little boutique in St Helena.  This is NOT Boudoir, it is diluted,the color is different.  I did a side by side of mine and this one on a test strip and out of 10 people NO one said they were  the same.  I knew there would be a 2 day delay processing time but they shipped it ground rather than 2 day with prime. I am SO disappointed in this product! Who ever produced this product did a great job it trying to replicate the product packaging. So upsetting that Amazon would sell a product representing the real deal.</li>
            <li> Love it get alot of people  tell me this is my perfume I would say if you buy it you will love it</li>
            <li> Gave it 5 stars because this is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume, going back many years. I also ordered it for me, since the smell pleased me too.</li>
            <li> What can I say? This is a fabulous evening perfume, it smells of everything the name hints at. I love it.</li>
