            <li>I have never had this kind of reaction before.</li>
            <li>Maybe use the product at your own risk?</li>
            <li>This is a nice size package for the cost, and it has a very strong scent.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and it may irritate your nostrils like it does mine.  </li>
            <li>The smell was very strong and perfume-y.</li>
            <li>You get a LOT in the bottle- very good price for how much you get.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and makes your skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>Quite potent and nice.  </li>
            <li>This Smells Great, not to strong, left my skin nice and smooth and my bathroom smells wonderful too, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li>Wow was it a very pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was full and a good Size.  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelmingly strong once it disolves in the warm water either.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love taking a bath with these body salts.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure, but i bathe before bed and want something to make me sleepy, not envigorated.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of Chamomile and Lavender.....</li>
            <li>its so relaxing and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I am transformed into a delicious milk bath of scents that relax not only the mind but soothes the body as well!  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it online as I can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>love this body wash have been using it for some time now and feels like my personel spa</li>
            <li>many times over</li>
            <li>I got this for my sister-in-law and was suprised as how potent the smell was that came from the beads.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bath routine.</li>
            <li>It is the real thing and smells great.</li>
            <li>I love this product as well as the milk bath.</li>
            <li>This product is much more fragrant than the one I just rated.</li>
            <li>Spend more for better quality.</li>
            <li>more strongly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the product but did not realize it contains lots of oils.</li>
            <li>I love lavender and this is no exception</li>
            <li>I was able to save most of it</li>
            <li>This product was just okay for me.</li>
            <li>As I am sitting here typing this review, my body does feel a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love bath salts, this one smells good and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I love lavender, but I like a light scent.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find them here, at a reasonable price and with prompt shipping.</li>
            <li>Although I received these very quickly, I purchased this product for decoration thinking they would be purple to match my lavender bathroom.  </li>
            <li>When I put this in the bath, it had a strong soapy smell but no lavender scent.</li>
            <li>and I strongly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and it is important that the bath crystals do not bubble because the bubbles overflow when the jets are moving the water.</li>
            <li>And silky silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous scent.</li>
            <li>and it is a great buy compared to local places I checked for these!!</li>
            <li>The Aveeno product is also available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The salts make your bath smell like rich lavender when first applied but later becomes a light lavender scent, very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I was ordering this for a gift from Amazon, and I was so excited for it to arrive.  </li>
            <li>Got these for my mother-in-law our first Christmas, and it has become one of her favorite gift items.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>I would recommend spending a bit more to get a higher quality salt soak.</li>
            <li>I was sitting in the bath and got excited because I felt like the product was working.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually used the bath salts, yet, but I was pleasantly surprised by the generous amount you get and the wonderful scent, not too perfumey yet robust.</li>
            <li>and I was able to contact the actual company to send me some from their own warehouse, which did come  in time to gift it, and I kept the others in a jar for myself.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, dissolves fast and completely,  </li>
            <li>it smells nice and helps me to relax; this is a nice product I will have to try out the other sents as well.</li>
            <li>but nothing special.</li>
            <li>I love this product and find it is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>She wants more.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice lavender with a soft scent go for EO instead of this one.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong smelling it in the container</li>
            <li>The Lavender is definitely the best in terms of lasting power!  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used a lot of different salts from different carriers in both Germany and the US and this stuff is some of the best bang for your buck I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>English Lavender Body Soak is a nice lavender color, dissolves easily under running water and makes the bath water soft for a lovely, soothing bath.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other lavender bath salts that I enjoy more than this.</li>
            <li>They are very nice scents, but more subtle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this bath soak!!!</li>
            <li>Is this what the product is suppose to do if someone wants to shed some light?</li>
            <li>I ended up giving a 3 star because my body is now relaxed and calm and no tenderness.</li>
            <li>Far better than others I have</li>
            <li>It was so fresh that it remained on the person beyond the bath spa.</li>
            <li>BTW, with a bag of plain old Epsom Salts costing almost 3 bucks now, these are a great deal!</li>
            <li>This one came right as scheduled delivary.</li>
            <li>The attractive plastic container is easy to open and close (wide screw-on cap).  </li>
            <li>(we have a very large tub).  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did and have no regrets.</li>
            <li>The smell of lavender fills the bathroom with such a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>Used up my first jar and had to get another.</li>
            <li>it says that it is an English Lavender, but it smells more of a lavender with quite a bit of chamomile and eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>I would buy this product again and most likely will.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again and will look for more scents.</li>
            <li>i like the quality of the salts, dead sea salts for a good price.  </li>
            <li>great nice smell left behind.  </li>
            <li>Neither I nor my sister found it very appealing (I gave it to her after I used it once and disliked it).</li>
            <li>Bough these to go with the Footsie Bath Black Foot Spa, and they smell really nice.</li>
            <li>This is definitely softening, but the scent is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Did not realize how large the container was going to be.  </li>
            <li>but they are quite large.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have on hand just for a little variety in the bath salt supply in the bathroom....</li>
            <li>We got this as a gift for someone that is hard to shop for, they loved it.</li>
            <li>The sent is very soothing.</li>
            <li>i think the lavender has a bit too much eucalyptus in it,</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, nothing damaged and no leaks!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and she said she really likes the aroma.</li>
            <li>very shower  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to use much per bath ...  </li>
            <li>I purchased it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very theraputic.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the village naturals white tea and jasmine bath salts</li>
            <li>It smells very lavender-y if you&#x27;re smelling the container, but once you add it to the bathwater, the scent seems to vanish.</li>
            <li>thanks I will give these as gifts&lt;br /&gt;Raine</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing</li>
            <li>I have more of a sensitive skin and there are several bath salts that don&#x27;t make my skin tender, however, this one does.  </li>
            <li>This product has a very strong smell, so I have to use less of it than I would like.</li>
            <li>I have used many types of bath salts and two other types by this company.</li>
            <li>These bath salts make the water in your tub extra soft, but the fragrance wasn&#x27;t as pleasant as I had hoped it would be - - it&#x27;s not offensive, but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>that kind of rosemary-herb scent that i usually like, but not in a relaxing bath salt.  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t really natural, it is rather obviously chemically boosted, but I enjoy it anyway.  </li>
            <li>This brand has always had an inexpensive, decent product, so I tried this version.  </li>
            <li>We made a basket with this as the main item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use these for a quick bath and possibly even shower afterwards.</li>
            <li>It sure comes in as a mess sometimes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a little more lavender though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After Further Use: I have ended up liking this product very much after using it a few more times.</li>
            <li>what I bought last night is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>In a few minutes, the eucalyptus and menthol scents came out and became so strong that they stung my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li>With this product, I only use 1/2 cup or less, otherwise the fragrance is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I got these as a gift and the packaging is quite large, I thought based on the image it would be smaller</li>
            <li>I was recently surprised to see this same brand (and scent) of bath salts at the bullseye store for much cheaper ($3.24)</li>
            <li>It makes the water soft (I will give it that)</li>
            <li>I have looked everywhere for these lavender bath crystals as both the stores near my home have discontinued them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin on my body</li>
            <li>so was surprised to have this reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is so soothing and soft to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I put my clothes back on, and after a few minutes, everything was ok and no rash developed.</li>
            <li>it was white in color, nothing on the bottle about dead sea salts, and extremely potent in scent.     </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when my current bottle is empty!</li>
            <li>these go a long way, unless you like things really odorous.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin in general, but nothing has ever done this to my skin before.  </li>
            <li>I have because that burning is not a pleasant feeling :)</li>
            <li>Was looking to put in hot tub like your other product which does not contain oil..</li>
            <li>First time last year when I had ordered bath oil - when shipment was received the caps were loose and had spilled - resulting in loss of about a fifth of contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife used this and the entire house smelled like an old grandma had a perfume accident.</li>
            <li>The salt makes your skin feel really soft but the scent does not last.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have received something direct from Village Naturals.  </li>
            <li>Not of natural Lavender essential oil</li>
            <li>I believe the product was changed at some point as the positive reviews from 2010 describe it as purple in color with a soft scent, and dead sea salt.  </li>
            <li>But I had to get out of the bath as the  burning became strong and once I stepped out I experienced a weird shivering sensation/extremely cold sensation.</li>
            <li>It is actually Lavender w/chamomile and other fragrances, and has so much eucalyptus oil</li>
            <li>and I poured about half the content in to soak being pregnant and having extremely sore muscles.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have never had this kind of reaction before.</li>
            <li> Maybe use the product at your own risk?</li>
            <li> This is a nice size package for the cost, and it has a very strong scent.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and it may irritate your nostrils like it does mine.  </li>
            <li> The smell was very strong and perfume-y.</li>
            <li> You get a LOT in the bottle- very good price for how much you get.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and makes your skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> Quite potent and nice.  </li>
            <li> This Smells Great, not to strong, left my skin nice and smooth and my bathroom smells wonderful too, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Wow was it a very pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was full and a good Size.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelmingly strong once it disolves in the warm water either.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love taking a bath with these body salts.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure, but i bathe before bed and want something to make me sleepy, not envigorated.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of Chamomile and Lavender.....</li>
            <li> its so relaxing and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I am transformed into a delicious milk bath of scents that relax not only the mind but soothes the body as well!  </li>
            <li> Glad I found it online as I can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> and I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> love this body wash have been using it for some time now and feels like my personel spa</li>
            <li> many times over</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister-in-law and was suprised as how potent the smell was that came from the beads.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bath routine.</li>
            <li> It is the real thing and smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this product as well as the milk bath.</li>
            <li> This product is much more fragrant than the one I just rated.</li>
            <li> Spend more for better quality.</li>
            <li> more strongly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the product but did not realize it contains lots of oils.</li>
            <li> I love lavender and this is no exception</li>
            <li> I was able to save most of it</li>
            <li> This product was just okay for me.</li>
            <li> As I am sitting here typing this review, my body does feel a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love bath salts, this one smells good and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love lavender, but I like a light scent.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find them here, at a reasonable price and with prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> Although I received these very quickly, I purchased this product for decoration thinking they would be purple to match my lavender bathroom.  </li>
            <li> When I put this in the bath, it had a strong soapy smell but no lavender scent.</li>
            <li> and I strongly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> and it is important that the bath crystals do not bubble because the bubbles overflow when the jets are moving the water.</li>
            <li> And silky silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous scent.</li>
            <li> and it is a great buy compared to local places I checked for these!!</li>
            <li> The Aveeno product is also available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The salts make your bath smell like rich lavender when first applied but later becomes a light lavender scent, very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was ordering this for a gift from Amazon, and I was so excited for it to arrive.  </li>
            <li> Got these for my mother-in-law our first Christmas, and it has become one of her favorite gift items.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend spending a bit more to get a higher quality salt soak.</li>
            <li> I was sitting in the bath and got excited because I felt like the product was working.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the bath salts, yet, but I was pleasantly surprised by the generous amount you get and the wonderful scent, not too perfumey yet robust.</li>
            <li> and I was able to contact the actual company to send me some from their own warehouse, which did come  in time to gift it, and I kept the others in a jar for myself.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, dissolves fast and completely,  </li>
            <li> it smells nice and helps me to relax; this is a nice product I will have to try out the other sents as well.</li>
            <li> but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love this product and find it is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> She wants more.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a nice lavender with a soft scent go for EO instead of this one.</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty strong smelling it in the container</li>
            <li> The Lavender is definitely the best in terms of lasting power!  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used a lot of different salts from different carriers in both Germany and the US and this stuff is some of the best bang for your buck I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> English Lavender Body Soak is a nice lavender color, dissolves easily under running water and makes the bath water soft for a lovely, soothing bath.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other lavender bath salts that I enjoy more than this.</li>
            <li> They are very nice scents, but more subtle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this bath soak!!!</li>
            <li> Is this what the product is suppose to do if someone wants to shed some light?</li>
            <li> I ended up giving a 3 star because my body is now relaxed and calm and no tenderness.</li>
            <li> Far better than others I have</li>
            <li> It was so fresh that it remained on the person beyond the bath spa.</li>
            <li> BTW, with a bag of plain old Epsom Salts costing almost 3 bucks now, these are a great deal!</li>
            <li> This one came right as scheduled delivary.</li>
            <li> The attractive plastic container is easy to open and close (wide screw-on cap).  </li>
            <li> (we have a very large tub).  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did and have no regrets.</li>
            <li> The smell of lavender fills the bathroom with such a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> Used up my first jar and had to get another.</li>
            <li> it says that it is an English Lavender, but it smells more of a lavender with quite a bit of chamomile and eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li> I would buy this product again and most likely will.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again and will look for more scents.</li>
            <li> i like the quality of the salts, dead sea salts for a good price.  </li>
            <li> great nice smell left behind.  </li>
            <li> Neither I nor my sister found it very appealing (I gave it to her after I used it once and disliked it).</li>
            <li> Bough these to go with the Footsie Bath Black Foot Spa, and they smell really nice.</li>
            <li> This is definitely softening, but the scent is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Did not realize how large the container was going to be.  </li>
            <li> but they are quite large.  </li>
            <li> Nice to have on hand just for a little variety in the bath salt supply in the bathroom....</li>
            <li> We got this as a gift for someone that is hard to shop for, they loved it.</li>
            <li> The sent is very soothing.</li>
            <li> i think the lavender has a bit too much eucalyptus in it,</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, nothing damaged and no leaks!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and she said she really likes the aroma.</li>
            <li> very shower  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to use much per bath ...  </li>
            <li> I purchased it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very theraputic.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the village naturals white tea and jasmine bath salts</li>
            <li> It smells very lavender-y if you&#x27;re smelling the container, but once you add it to the bathwater, the scent seems to vanish.</li>
            <li> thanks I will give these as gifts&lt;br /&gt;Raine</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing</li>
            <li> I have more of a sensitive skin and there are several bath salts that don&#x27;t make my skin tender, however, this one does.  </li>
            <li> This product has a very strong smell, so I have to use less of it than I would like.</li>
            <li> I have used many types of bath salts and two other types by this company.</li>
            <li> These bath salts make the water in your tub extra soft, but the fragrance wasn&#x27;t as pleasant as I had hoped it would be - - it&#x27;s not offensive, but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> that kind of rosemary-herb scent that i usually like, but not in a relaxing bath salt.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t really natural, it is rather obviously chemically boosted, but I enjoy it anyway.  </li>
            <li> This brand has always had an inexpensive, decent product, so I tried this version.  </li>
            <li> We made a basket with this as the main item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use these for a quick bath and possibly even shower afterwards.</li>
            <li> It sure comes in as a mess sometimes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little more lavender though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After Further Use: I have ended up liking this product very much after using it a few more times.</li>
            <li> what I bought last night is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> In a few minutes, the eucalyptus and menthol scents came out and became so strong that they stung my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> With this product, I only use 1/2 cup or less, otherwise the fragrance is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift and the packaging is quite large, I thought based on the image it would be smaller</li>
            <li> I was recently surprised to see this same brand (and scent) of bath salts at the bullseye store for much cheaper ($3.24)</li>
            <li> It makes the water soft (I will give it that)</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere for these lavender bath crystals as both the stores near my home have discontinued them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin on my body</li>
            <li> so was surprised to have this reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is so soothing and soft to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I put my clothes back on, and after a few minutes, everything was ok and no rash developed.</li>
            <li> it was white in color, nothing on the bottle about dead sea salts, and extremely potent in scent.     </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when my current bottle is empty!</li>
            <li> these go a long way, unless you like things really odorous.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin in general, but nothing has ever done this to my skin before.  </li>
            <li> I have because that burning is not a pleasant feeling :)</li>
            <li> Was looking to put in hot tub like your other product which does not contain oil..</li>
            <li> First time last year when I had ordered bath oil - when shipment was received the caps were loose and had spilled - resulting in loss of about a fifth of contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife used this and the entire house smelled like an old grandma had a perfume accident.</li>
            <li> The salt makes your skin feel really soft but the scent does not last.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have received something direct from Village Naturals.  </li>
            <li> Not of natural Lavender essential oil</li>
            <li> I believe the product was changed at some point as the positive reviews from 2010 describe it as purple in color with a soft scent, and dead sea salt.  </li>
            <li> But I had to get out of the bath as the  burning became strong and once I stepped out I experienced a weird shivering sensation/extremely cold sensation.</li>
            <li> It is actually Lavender w/chamomile and other fragrances, and has so much eucalyptus oil</li>
            <li> and I poured about half the content in to soak being pregnant and having extremely sore muscles.</li>
            <li> like these salts, a litte goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> We have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> but they were shipped open and spilled all over the Amazon box which included other orders.  </li>
            <li> The lids are often loose and the product spilled in the shipping container.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t stand to be in it for very long- not very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> not sure what they put in the vanilla amber, maybe some fake scent, but it&#x27;s softer and works better for me.</li>
            <li> Once the water had covered most of my body, the pain was so bad I had to jump out of the tub.  </li>
            <li> The package says its gentle, but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and it burned like crazy.</li>
            <li> so bought the White Tea and Vanilla Amber to round out my collection.  </li>
            <li> After only a few minutes, it started to burn my skin.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this product again because of the strong, unpleasant perfume scent.  </li>
            <li> I will be trying other fragrances when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> Very positive impact on skin tone even in very dry and cold weather.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is how the product is supposed to work for dry skin and sore muscles.</li>
            <li> It has a slight scent.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is in this product that isn&#x27;t in their other products, but this was a disaster.  </li>
            <li> It has little aroma.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this a little while ago.</li>
            <li> However after this 2nd bad packaging result I don&#x27;t know if I will ever order anything if it has to come direct from them.</li>
            <li> I use a scrub brush in the tub to scrub away any dead skin sells with this and</li>
            <li> After a few minutes in the bath, my skin began to tingle and burn.  </li>
            <li> I immediately rinsed off and within a few minutes the burning subsided.</li>
            <li> Not good at all, and it makes me concerned about their other products as well.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s very little to say about this.</li>
            <li> When I got the product it was in a box that was too small</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are white.</li>
            <li> I sat in the bath for about 5 minutes before experiencing a very painful burning sensation as though I had been bathing in icy hot.</li>
            <li> You could smell the contents from at least 15 feet away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to get back in to finish the rest of the salt</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not amazing</li>
            <li> I like this one for its moisturizing and general hot-bath-relaxing features, but was disappointed in the amount of scent it produced.</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re looking to relax or prepare for that secret rendezvous, these will make you feel like a billion bucks.</li>
            <li> Products (Village Naturals Bath Shoppe Lavender &amp; Chamomile Body Salt 31 oz), arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Not that expensive either.  </li>
            <li> That does nor smell fake.</li>
            <li> Too close to Christmas to reorder...so sad</li>
            <li> the package knew something was wrong.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately so I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The weird part with the burning</li>
            <li> I hate fake, artificial scents.</li>
            <li> Will not be ordering again and very unhappy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my purchases.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it.  The smell of lavender fills the bathroom with such a lovely scent.  Not that expensive either.  Used up my first jar and had to get another.</li>
            <li> I love taking a bath with these body salts. It is like a spa experience. I had received this product last Christmas, and went on line to find it. I ordered two!</li>
            <li> This one came right as scheduled delivary. The sent is very soothing. Could smell it through the house and would order again. All Products from Village Naturals have been great and they are usuable in the whirlpool. The bath salts are anyways. Yes would recommend the bath salts and I do continue to order.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bath crystals from Amazon.  I like this product because it smells very nice and it does not bubble.  We have a jacuzzi bath tub and it is important that the bath crystals do not bubble because the bubbles overflow when the jets are moving the water.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and used to get it at the local Wal-Mart.  It is a great product.  Wonderful light scent.  That does nor smell fake.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present so I cannot personally vouch for it but she was very happy to get it.</li>
            <li> These are your basic bath salts. They don&#x27;t smell amazing, but they do smell descent and are also dead-sea salts.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for her birthday and got one for myself.  Did not realize how large the container was going to be.  Smells wonderful and makes your skin so soft.  Love this</li>
            <li> These bath crystals don&#x27;t bubble and have a most pleasant aroma.  I love this product and find it is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> i like the quality of the salts, dead sea salts for a good price.  it&#x27;s about the best you can get without going organic and paying a lot.  these go a long way, unless you like things really odorous.  i think the lavender has a bit too much eucalyptus in it, that kind of rosemary-herb scent that i usually like, but not in a relaxing bath salt.  it&#x27;s good for sore muscles i&#x27;m sure, but i bathe before bed and want something to make me sleepy, not envigorated.  i don&#x27;t smell enough lavender in this one and just get that generic perfume-y smell.  i&#x27;ll use it of course, just not a lot at one time.  not sure what they put in the vanilla amber, maybe some fake scent, but it&#x27;s softer and works better for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the bath salts, yet, but I was pleasantly surprised by the generous amount you get and the wonderful scent, not too perfumey yet robust.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell. My wife used this and the entire house smelled like an old grandma had a perfume accident. It&#x27;s been banned from the house.</li>
            <li> Perfect way to relax the smell takes you away</li>
            <li> I was ordering this for a gift from Amazon, and I was so excited for it to arrive.  When I got the product it was in a box that was too small so there wasn&#x27;t enough packaging (bubble wrap, packing peanuts, etc.) in with it, so when it was getting shipped and thrown around the casing to the salts became shattered the lid broke off and the spilled everywhere in the box.  I had to call and complain to customer service.  After being hung up on once, I finally got through to another person who heard me out.  They issued a refund to me which went through almost immediately (thankfully) and I was able to contact the actual company to send me some from their own warehouse, which did come  in time to gift it, and I kept the others in a jar for myself.  As for the product itself- it says that it is an English Lavender, but it smells more of a lavender with quite a bit of chamomile and eucalyptus.  The smell is very strong and it may irritate your nostrils like it does mine.  I have more of a sensitive skin and there are several bath salts that don&#x27;t make my skin tender, however, this one does.  It makes the water soft (I will give it that) but I can&#x27;t stand to be in it for very long- not very relaxing.  I would not order this product again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, nothing damaged and no leaks!&lt;br /&gt;I like these salts, a litte goes a long way.  Bought a 2nd one already.&lt;br /&gt;Tip!  I use a scrub brush in the tub to scrub away any dead skin sells with this and the combination of the warm bath and salts gives your skin a refreshed tingly feeling.  And silky silky smooth.  Will buy again&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I made a bath for my nan, he now ALWAYS joins my baths. He finds what ever reason to join!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this product again because of the strong, unpleasant perfume scent.  It didn&#x27;t smell like lavender at all to me.</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere for these lavender bath crystals as both the stores near my home have discontinued them. I was delighted to find them here, at a reasonable price and with prompt shipping. I&#x27;ll be back! Thank you for a wonderful experience.</li>
            <li> The bath salts smelled great! ..but they were shipped open and spilled all over the Amazon box which included other orders.  Too close to Christmas to reorder...so sad</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Chamomile and Lavender.....its so relaxing and I love it.  I feel like I am transformed into a delicious milk bath of scents that relax not only the mind but soothes the body as well!  I will definitely buy this product and recommend it to others!  All they need now is to make one with milk and honey &#x3D;o)</li>
            <li> I love this !  Fabulous scent. Far better than others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;This arrives on time and in excellent condition.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the \\&quot;English Lavender\\&quot; Body Soak but what I bought last night is a pretty decent product. The scent is pretty strong smelling it in the container and I was having second thoughts about using it but I&#x27;m glad I did and have no regrets. This body soak softened up my water and especially my skin. I didn&#x27;t want to get out of the tub it was so relaxing. Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all so I&#x27;m good. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelmingly strong once it disolves in the warm water either. Don&#x27;t let the scent in the container throw you off. I would buy this product again and most likely will.</li>
            <li> Got these for my mother-in-law our first Christmas, and it has become one of her favorite gift items. The bottle has changed shape since then, but I needn&#x27;t have worried; the scent is still wonderful.</li>
            <li> These bath salts smell amazing and help me relax every night when I take a bath. Must have! Glad I found it online as I can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> These are really good.  Takes only a handful for a bath.  Quite potent and nice.  Very positive impact on skin tone even in very dry and cold weather.</li>
            <li> Great item for a fan of lavender. Got this for a Christmas present for my GF and she said she really likes the aroma.</li>
            <li> I received this package yesterday.  Wow was it a very pleasant surprise.  I love the smell and I love how it feels on my skin. The price was affordable. This is a keeper. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Bough these to go with the Footsie Bath Black Foot Spa, and they smell really nice. Good deal for the quantity you receive.</li>
            <li> This brand of bath salts are great!  Very good strong scent even after it is diluted in water.  The attractive plastic container is easy to open and close (wide screw-on cap).  I was recently surprised to see this same brand (and scent) of bath salts at the bullseye store for much cheaper ($3.24) so bought the White Tea and Vanilla Amber to round out my collection.  They are very nice scents, but more subtle.  The Lavender is definitely the best in terms of lasting power!  I figure they all smell great in the container, but it&#x27;s what lasts once it&#x27;s in your tub that counts!  BTW, with a bag of plain old Epsom Salts costing almost 3 bucks now, these are a great deal!</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift and the packaging is quite large, I thought based on the image it would be smaller but they are quite large.  The package has quite a bit in their, they are super easy to use when the bath is filling with water just pour the salts in under the water flow and they dissolve into the water, they have an excellent smell and provide a great relaxing bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this and it is a great buy compared to local places I checked for these!!</li>
            <li> When I put this in the bath, it had a strong soapy smell but no lavender scent. In a few minutes, the eucalyptus and menthol scents came out and became so strong that they stung my eyes a bit. Undeterred, I hopped in for what I thought would be a rejuvenating bath.  After a few minutes in the bath, my skin began to tingle and burn.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin on my body so was surprised to have this reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should remove this product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size package for the cost, and it has a very strong scent.  I only need to use a couple tablespoons for my giant soaking tub.  The scent isn&#x27;t really natural, it is rather obviously chemically boosted, but I enjoy it anyway.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any ring or residue on the tub, which is another plus</li>
            <li> love this body wash have been using it for some time now and feels like my personel spa very shower  have ordered it n&#x3D;many times over</li>
            <li> I have a whirlpool bath, so I can only use bath salts.  This brand has always had an inexpensive, decent product, so I tried this version.  After only a few minutes, it started to burn my skin.  I have sensitive skin in general, but nothing has ever done this to my skin before.  Once the water had covered most of my body, the pain was so bad I had to jump out of the tub.  Not sure what is in this product that isn&#x27;t in their other products, but this was a disaster.  Now I&#x27;m sitting here with Neosporin all over me.  Not good at all, and it makes me concerned about their other products as well.</li>
            <li> These make your bath, and then you, smell great. Whether you&#x27;re looking to relax or prepare for that secret rendezvous, these will make you feel like a billion bucks. Put a do not disturb sign on the door, you don&#x27;t want any interruptions while using this.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent. Very relaxing and you don&#x27;t need to use much per bath ...  The bottle was full and a good Size.  I recommend this</li>
            <li> We got this as a gift for someone that is hard to shop for, they loved it. We made a basket with this as the main item.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister-in-law and was suprised as how potent the smell was that came from the beads. I did not use this myself but can see why she wanted some. Might have to try this!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, shipping was great, I can&#x27;t seem to find bath salts online anymore, so this was a treat!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. You get a LOT in the bottle- very good price for how much you get. The salts smell wonderful and makes such a great, relaxing bath. I highly recommend this bath soak!!! I will definitely buy more when my current bottle is empty!</li>
            <li> Seemed to be a good item. It was bought as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love bath salts, this one smells good and is very relaxing. I purchased it at a reasonable price. I would recommend this product to family and friends. It arrived promptly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bath routine. It is the real thing and smells great. It is not a manufactured scent. I hate fake, artificial scents. Makes my nose sting.</li>
            <li> I love this product as well as the milk bath. I feel so refreshed after each use. Thinking about purchasing another bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells great, dissolves fast and completely,  great nice smell left behind.  Would definitely buy again and will look for more scents.</li>
            <li> This is not the product I bought last time. It was from VILLAGE NATURALS BATH SHOPPE called ENLISH LAVENDER BODY SOAK, 31 oz.  This product is much more fragrant than the one I just rated. I can&#x27;t find the same product anywhere. Suggestions?</li>
            <li> This stuff is gross.  It smells like cleaning products, NOT like lavender.  If you are used to getting your bath products at the dollar store then you might like this stuff.  But if you want something that doesn&#x27;t smell like you just poured draino in your bath, either spring for the good stuff or make your own.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product when I was vacationing in North Carolina this summer. It was great in the bath. I have very sensitive skin and it seems to not have any drying effects. I like the Lavender for the fragrance, and I probably use 1/4 of a jar per bath. It&#x27;s very theraputic.</li>
            <li> Village Naturals Bath Shoppe English Lavender Body Soak is a nice lavender color, dissolves easily under running water and makes the bath water soft for a lovely, soothing bath.</li>
            <li> Title calls it English Lavender.  It is actually Lavender w/chamomile and other fragrances, and has so much eucalyptus oil It burns my nostrils.  I&#x27;m not overly picky, but this product is nothing like its description. I believe the product was changed at some point as the positive reviews from 2010 describe it as purple in color with a soft scent, and dead sea salt.  The product I received has none of those qualities... it was white in color, nothing on the bottle about dead sea salts, and extremely potent in scent.     Will not be ordering again and very unhappy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my Mom. She is the only one in the family to take a bath. She wants more.</li>
            <li> love this! it smells and feels great to use it in the tub.</li>
            <li> This is definitely softening, but the scent is too strong for me.  I love lavender, but I like a light scent. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice lavender with a soft scent go for EO instead of this one.</li>
            <li> These bath salts make the water in your tub extra soft, but the fragrance wasn&#x27;t as pleasant as I had hoped it would be - - it&#x27;s not offensive, but not what I expected.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> You get what you are paying for....cheap bath salts. They are nothing spectacular. Nice to have on hand just for a little variety in the bath salt supply in the bathroom....but nothing special. I&#x27;d use these for a quick bath and possibly even shower afterwards. Spend more for better quality.</li>
            <li> Village Naturals bath salts are the best.</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  It has little aroma.  I prefer Aveeno Stress Relief Foaming Bath.  It goes much further, six or seven baths compared to three with this product (we have a very large tub).  The Aveeno product is also available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the village naturals white tea and jasmine bath salts so I was excited to try this. The salt makes your skin feel really soft but the scent does not last. I have tried many other lavender bath salts that I enjoy more than this. For the price (on sale) it is excellent and I enjoy the feel of it on my skin...I was hoping for a little more lavender though.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my purchases. Products (Village Naturals Bath Shoppe Lavender &amp; Chamomile Body Salt 31 oz), arrived broken. And I was not refunded. Asked to return the products, but they were so damaged that I had to throw away.</li>
            <li> Gift and she loved. Smelled so good!!</li>
            <li> We loved these bath salts.  They smelled wonderful and came in a huge container.  It will definitely last awhile.  They were great for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this one for its moisturizing and general hot-bath-relaxing features, but was disappointed in the amount of scent it produced. It smells very lavender-y if you&#x27;re smelling the container, but once you add it to the bathwater, the scent seems to vanish. Overall, a product I would buy again if I cannot find a lavender/chamomile from another company that holds scent more strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Further Use: I have ended up liking this product very much after using it a few more times. I have found that using 1 1/2 times the salts that it indicates on the packaging brings the scent up to the level I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The salts make your bath smell like rich lavender when first applied but later becomes a light lavender scent, very pleasant.</li>
            <li> love the product but did not realize it contains lots of oils. Was looking to put in hot tub like your other product which does not contain oil..thanks I will give these as gifts&lt;br /&gt;Raine</li>
            <li> I love lavender and this is no exception it smells nice and helps me to relax; this is a nice product I will have to try out the other sents as well.</li>
            <li> This product is so soothing and soft to the skin.  It is very relaxing and I strongly recommend it.  It has a slight scent.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have received something direct from Village Naturals.  First time last year when I had ordered bath oil - when shipment was received the caps were loose and had spilled - resulting in loss of about a fifth of contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I ordered the bath salts - as soon as I got the package knew something was wrong.  You could smell the contents from at least 15 feet away.  When I opened the box the cap was totally off and the entire contents of the bath salts were scattered throughout the box.  I was able to save most of it but they need to do something with how they package products.  The product itself I am very happy with or I wouldn&#x27;t keep ordering it.  However after this 2nd bad packaging result I don&#x27;t know if I will ever order anything if it has to come direct from them.</li>
            <li> This product was just okay for me. The smell was very strong and perfume-y. Not of natural Lavender essential oil unfortunately so I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This Smells Great, not to strong, left my skin nice and smooth and my bathroom smells wonderful too, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for a long time. We now must put up with the inferior package/shipping preparation. The lids are often loose and the product spilled in the shipping container. The problem is the manufacturer does not seal the lids AT ALL.  It sure comes in as a mess sometimes. I can&#x27;t depend on local distribution in the stores.</li>
            <li> I had heard that Lavender soothes the nerves and sinus sensations. I purchased this Body soak to accompany a bath spa I purchased earlier. It worked perfectly. It was so fresh that it remained on the person beyond the bath spa. I will be trying other fragrances when this one is gone. (Appears that will be soon.)</li>
            <li> A lot of great smelling and feeling salt for the money. We&#x27;ve used a lot of different salts from different carriers in both Germany and the US and this stuff is some of the best bang for your buck I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s not amazing but it&#x27;s a lot and it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s very little to say about this. Neither I nor my sister found it very appealing (I gave it to her after I used it once and disliked it). It&#x27;s overly scented, and underwhelming in either stimulating or calming as a soak for a bath. Skip it and go for one of the stress relievers.</li>
            <li> Although I received these very quickly, I purchased this product for decoration thinking they would be purple to match my lavender bathroom.  Unfortunately, they are white.</li>
            <li> I have used many types of bath salts and two other types by this company. I sat in the bath for about 5 minutes before experiencing a very painful burning sensation as though I had been bathing in icy hot. I have never had this kind of reaction before. The package says its gentle, but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and it burned like crazy. I immediately rinsed off and within a few minutes the burning subsided.</li>
            <li> This product has a very strong smell, so I have to use less of it than I would like. When I use epsom salt, I pour in 1 or 2 cups into the bath. With this product, I only use 1/2 cup or less, otherwise the fragrance is overwhelming. I would recommend spending a bit more to get a higher quality salt soak.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this a little while ago. I ended up experiencing what another user experienced. I was sitting in the bath and got excited because I felt like the product was working. I called my husband over to explain the sensation to him. It was cooling to the skin for a while but then that cooling  became a burning sensation within 5 minutes literally. The label said to pour a generous amount and I poured about half the content in to soak being pregnant and having extremely sore muscles. Maybe I did something I wasn&#x27;t suppose too? But I had to get out of the bath as the  burning became strong and once I stepped out I experienced a weird shivering sensation/extremely cold sensation. I put my clothes back on, and after a few minutes, everything was ok and no rash developed. Not sure if this is how the product is supposed to work for dry skin and sore muscles. As I am sitting here typing this review, my body does feel a lot better. The soreness is gone. The weird part with the burning I felt, it was only on the parts that was giving me issues. Is this what the product is suppose to do if someone wants to shed some light? I&#x27;m afraid to get back in to finish the rest of the salt I have because that burning is not a pleasant feeling :) I ended up giving a 3 star because my body is now relaxed and calm and no tenderness. Maybe use the product at your own risk?</li>
