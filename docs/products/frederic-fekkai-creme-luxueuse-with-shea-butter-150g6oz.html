            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Big jar filled to the top with lots of product.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is beyond amazing, can&#x27;t even really describe it other than to say it&#x27;s light, unassuming yet alluring, almost \\&quot;buttery,\\&quot; &amp;</li>
            <li>The first time was at Sephora, but I haven&#x27;t seen it since.  </li>
            <li>It really is luxurious and worth every penny.</li>

            <li>This product was first introduced to me on the Oprah Winfrey show.  </li>
            <li>I heard about it, at first,  from one of Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s &amp;#34;Favorite things&amp;#34; episodes years ago and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>However it is pretty pricey</li>
            <li>a nice, long bath, or shower, followed by this HEAVENLY scented, GLORIOUS, body butter!&lt;br /&gt;Lightly towel off your skin, a bit wet, so the body butter can absorb, giving your skin hydration.&lt;br /&gt;Climb into a pair of clean jammies, and sheets…</li>

            <li> The description did not adequately describe the product.  </li>
            <li> so I always end up with several on hand, with just a select few to which I&#x27;m truly addicted.</li>
            <li> It had that plastic smell that all expired beauty products gets when they are past their expiration date.  </li>
            <li> I am so mad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Frederic Fekkai is no longer making this product. :(</li>
            <li> Deifinitely disappointed in the Fekkai product I was sent</li>

            <li> Great item and very fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> Cannot live  without this cream, the best moisterizer ever and soak in your skin completely. Just perfect</li>
            <li> Applying[[ASIN:B000Z61V02 Frederic Fekkai Shea Butter Creme Luxueuse, Luxurious Body Cream With Shea Butter 6 oz (150 g)]]is like bringing a luxury spa to your home...on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is creamy -- which means you don&#x27;t need a lot to get the moisturizing and fragrant (light and refreshing -- perfect for summer) effect. And, because you don&#x27;t need a lot, this product will last much longer than your regular bought-in-a-pinch-while-grocery-shopping body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to receive dozens of compliments!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for years.  It smells delicious, and is very moisturizing. I truly cannot live without it.  Great product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I only hope it is made again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fickle product junkie &amp; my weakness is body creams so I always end up with several on hand, with just a select few to which I&#x27;m truly addicted. This is one of my top addictions! The fragrance is beyond amazing, can&#x27;t even really describe it other than to say it&#x27;s light, unassuming yet alluring, almost \\&quot;buttery,\\&quot; &amp; pleasing to the senses. So many fragrances give me a headache but not this one. I end up wanting to smell myself all day when I wear this &amp; so does my husband. Thick &amp; rich consistency that works into the skin in no time &amp; leaves it so soft. Big jar filled to the top with lots of product. No wonder Oprah had this on one of her Favorites lists!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this butter.  The first time was at Sephora, but I haven&#x27;t seen it since.  The fragrance is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I guess this product was old, because the smell was so weak. Wish I could fine a good jar. Any one has a newer jar?</li>
            <li> This shea butter is the creamiest I&#x27;ve used. The scent is wonderful. I enjoy using it right after a shower. It makes your skin soft and moisturized without feeling greasy. It really is luxurious and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This well-named cream, unfortunately now discontinued, has a delicate fragrance, super moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;texture (only a small amount is needed), and best of all, leaves you feeling pampered and a tiny bit&lt;br /&gt;decadent.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This product was first introduced to me on the Oprah Winfrey show.  I bought it and loved it!  I have given many as gifts.  It&#x27;s great for layering under your perfume or cologne.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this cream numerous times. Love the buttery softness of my skin after using it. Pleasing smell. Definitely a repeat product for me.</li>
            <li> Love this and its smell. Makes me feel lovely</li>
            <li> definetely is a 5 stars, this cream you are gonna love it, leave your skin so smooth and can feel it since the firs time you try it and smells soooo good , worth every penny. i&#x27;ll buy it again and forever. very pleased , thanks</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this stuff. It is so smooth and creamy with a delicious smell to it! Cannot speak to the claimed discontinuation of this product and cannot verify as there are no date stampings on my container. I guess I will look into that before ordering again.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this creme!!! Several years ago I stopped wearing perfumes and started wearing perfumed body lotion. The scents are more subtle, long-lasting and leave my skin soft. This stuff is awesome and this is my second jar. I wear it on &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; occasions and love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer</li>
            <li> Want a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for winter dry skin, and depression?&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice, long bath, or shower, followed by this HEAVENLY scented, GLORIOUS, body butter!&lt;br /&gt;Lightly towel off your skin, a bit wet, so the body butter can absorb, giving your skin hydration.&lt;br /&gt;Climb into a pair of clean jammies, and sheets…&lt;br /&gt; My recipe for the ultimate snow day, need a pick -me-up, or, your day off…&lt;br /&gt;Pure bliss!</li>
            <li> When I could no longer purchase it at Bloomingdale&#x27;s or Saks I&lt;br /&gt;called the company and was told it was no longer available. Finally&lt;br /&gt;went on line @ amazon . Just thrilled that I could get it again. Usually&lt;br /&gt;order 2-4 jars at a time because I never want to be without it.  Ir&lt;br /&gt; works so well for my skin like no other creme I&#x27;ve used.  Please&lt;br /&gt;do no ever stop making this wonderful creme.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL, This product was discontinued from Fekkai over 5 YEARS ago!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product used to be the bee&#x27;s knees in terms of lux body cream! I mean it was &amp;#34;Oprah&#x27;s Favorite Things&amp;#34; one year. Ever since then I have been hooked. I hadn&#x27;t bought this for a while and went to look for it on various department store websites and it was gone. So I googled and the only place it showed up was on Amazon or an auction site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a live chat with Fekkai and they said it has been discontinued for over 5 YEARS!!!  So be careful people when ordering because the one I received was rancid! It had that plastic smell that all expired beauty products gets when they are past their expiration date.  So even tho you will be buying a new product, just know it wont be the same as when it was fresh. I am so mad this was discontinued, but that&#x27;s what happens when small companies sell out to corporate America.</li>
            <li> This cream not only smells amazing but is so hydrating to the skin without being greasy!  Promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great cream but upon delivery packaging was all falling apart and the product looked old.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need any perfume when you wear this body butter.  I heard about it, at first,  from one of Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s &amp;#34;Favorite things&amp;#34; episodes years ago and decided to try it. Have been hooked ever since!</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my Daughter ~  i&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s enjoying it alot!  june m. tonkin</li>
            <li> This is my favorite thing in the world, I could just jump inside the jar!&lt;br /&gt;Looovvvee It!</li>
            <li> The best body cream ever! You must try, but be prepared to never wanting to use any other body cream, EVER</li>
            <li> Somehow there is a chemical after-smell when I apply it. I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s the reason why this product has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> The best cream for your dry body. I purchased 2 jars for my daughters&#x27; birthdays. They absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times. It is not inexpensive, but I would continue to purchase it if it were available. Unfortunately, Frederic Fekkai is no longer making this product. :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this from my mom and she simply Loves it.  it is something that you must experience to understand</li>
            <li> This is a great creme for winter dry skin.  It is a shame that it has been discontinued.  Get it while you can...</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering a Shea Butter Skin Creme not a hair product.  The description did not adequately describe the product.  Deifinitely disappointed in the Fekkai product I was sent</li>
            <li> Makes my wife&#x27;s skin softer she loves these products!!! If you try this one time you will never use anything else. Yes it is a little more expensive but well worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic during the winter.  It prevents dry skin, winter itch, and ezcema breakouts.  Smells great.  Very soft like souffle cream.  However it is pretty pricey but you definitely get what you paid for.</li>
