            <li>It smells great and is a quick fix for those times</li>
            <li>Love it, what more can I say!</li>

            <li>However, the scent is extremely overwhelming and not at all pleasing.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I came across this at the health food store in my neighborhood and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He ended up not being able to hear me or claiming he could not hear me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then again, I love the smell of lavender.</li>
            <li>but so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of lavender instead of alcohol.</li>
            <li>More than one co-worker</li>
            <li>Nice, soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells great and this size offers plenty for a month</li>
            <li>All of EO&#x27;s scents are very natural-smelling , but the lavender is, by far, the best and the scent is simply lovely.  </li>
            <li>lavender scent brightens the room&lt;br /&gt;soft gel absorbs easily</li>
            <li>Strong smell but works well</li>
            <li>This stuff dries with a strong scent of alcohol, but my hands are not drying out.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a strong smell but not overpowering or obnoxious.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using this hand sanitizer dries my hands a lot slower than conventional hand sanitizers, which is especially wonderful during the winter!</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands and had a very nice scent.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was alcohol free...</li>
            <li>This products has ingredients that I am comfortable using to sanitize.</li>
            <li>and after I use it, my hands feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Patients comment on the pleasant smell and I enjoy using a less toxic product whenever I am able.</li>
            <li>I have not used it very much because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Granted, conventional hand sanitizers also can have a strong scent, albeit not as strong--but not as pleasant.</li>
            <li>gel quickly.  </li>
            <li>Expensive, but nice quality, great fragrance.</li>
            <li>The price is right for any budget.</li>
            <li>I love the EO hand sanitizing products in general.</li>
            <li>I love EO products in general, but this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I use it at the office when I absolutely cannot get to the bathroom to wash my hands after a sneeze or a quick snack.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 99.9% effective against most common germs that cause illness.</li>
            <li>The scent *is* strong, although I like it, and so do my co-workers whose desks are near mine.</li>
            <li>To be clear on my 2 star rating, while I rate the quality of the sanitizer higher, the smell is way too strong and musky to use.</li>
            <li>Much better than regular sanitizing product..</li>
            <li>if ur  not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return it but the first time I called I was put on hold and then disconnected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was impressed by how it only took 1 or 2 short pumps to get enough to do the job</li>
            <li>product and I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>And some people just cannot be comfortable with other people &amp;#34;introducing&amp;#34; new smells into their precious environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very strong smelling, but soft for multiple uses</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most sanitizers do.</li>
            <li>I gave the flight attendant the bottle that I had \\&quot;just because\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>EO sanitizer is gentle on my skin and it smells</li>
            <li>This hand sanitizer is a real improvement over the hand sanitizer I&#x27;ve been buying at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>A light lavender scent and it doesn&#x27;t seem as drying as regular hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li>bought two bottles - one for home, and one for work where the soap they provide in the restrooms is kind of harsh and drying, whereas EO has a moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li>nice light lavender scent and leaves a clean feeling on your hands - no soapy feel left behind.  </li>
            <li>This is so much better to use than the other sanitizers with all the chemicals in them.</li>
            <li>so you do not run out in a week like many other hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the norm at my workplace for employees to take as many steps to keep their hands clean as possible due to the nature of our work.</li>
            <li>This organic plant based alternative to chemical laden hand sanitizers has organic lavender essential oil blend to naturally clean &amp; refreshen hands while soothing jojoba oil nourishes &amp; moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent but a little drying on the hands.</li>
            <li>If you work in a spa and need to sanitize your hands frequently I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I find myself washing and sanitizing my hands more than usual.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, but love the smell.</li>
            <li>makes my hands soft!</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your hands and the smell is very calming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a harsh, strong smell.</li>
            <li>The size is good because it lasts long enough (but when it&#x27;s finally empty I can use the big size to refill!).</li>
            <li>Smells so much better than regular hand sanitizer and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands as dry as the regular stuff either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly lavender</li>
            <li>I wanted something even my three year old grandson could use.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had to wash my hands after I used it, although I did buy this to use while handling a baby, so I might have been sensitive.</li>
            <li>Natural, fragrant, moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;CAN BE FOUND AT MOST PUBLIX  EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like floral scents but the lavender is very mild.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance without all of the weird chemicals!  </li>
            <li>, my clients love that it has a subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the idea behind this product, but I found the smell very strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quickly absorbed and leaves no residue at all, although the scent lingers a little while on the hands which, for me, is a bonus.</li>
            <li>and I have found that the conventional ethanol-based hand sanitizers that we employees use at our &amp;#34;non-dirty work desks&amp;#34; dry our hands quickly.</li>
            <li>DOES NOT DRY HANDS</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s a very very subtle top note of something that might be sandalwood (??)</li>
            <li>I found it at Whole Foods starting using little ones and I needed a big one for my office.  </li>
            <li>I would have expected a clear gel-type consistency.</li>

            <li> and I have found that the conventional ethanol-based hand sanitizers that we employees use at our &amp;#34;non-dirty work desks&amp;#34; dry our hands quickly.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT DRY HANDS</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a very very subtle top note of something that might be sandalwood (??)</li>
            <li> I found it at Whole Foods starting using little ones and I needed a big one for my office.  </li>
            <li> I would have expected a clear gel-type consistency.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for my car, it&#x27;s so much nicer than the usual alcohol based hand sanitizer....</li>
            <li> This is the only hand sanitizer I have used that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a natural product that effectively killed germs.</li>
            <li> And the smell doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> second time I called I could not understand the Mid-East accent of the man on the other end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like how this product doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
            <li> dry your hands out!</li>
            <li> I bought it because I&#x27;ve been trying to not buy the typical hand sanitizers after reading the negative health risks, particularly for kids.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> so, although it is a little pricey compared with mainstream products, a bottle will go</li>
            <li> HEAVY LAVENDER SCENT.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have purchased already a few times.</li>
            <li> after months of nasty purell and other sanitizers this has a lovely non-fake lavender scent.  </li>
            <li> creates a layer over the skin that does not easily absorb.&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li> but I just wish it was  a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> As someone else mentioned, I think, the product is a bit gritty, which is sort of weird.</li>
            <li> only regret is that it&#x27;s rather expensive, so</li>
            <li> Not appealing.</li>
            <li> I am officially addicted.  </li>
            <li> This product has an overwhelmingly artificial odor.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> keeps those cold germs at bay....</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> have to toss this because the scent is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A sanitizer is a sanitizer, same ingredients.  What I like about this one is the lavender smell, and the organic brand.</li>
            <li> love this product I have been re buying it for 5 years. I use it to get the smell of onions off my hands while cooking, to sanitize and deodorize my compost container between fillings etc. love the smell</li>
            <li> Best smelling hand sanitizer!</li>
            <li> I am officially addicted.  I found it at Whole Foods starting using little ones and I needed a big one for my office.  This is the stuff. Smells great and this size offers plenty for a month</li>
            <li> I like it but some of my co-workers say it smells like scrubbing bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;Wont dry your hands out!</li>
            <li> Love it, what more can I say!</li>
            <li> I like how this product doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands. However, the scent is extremely overwhelming and not at all pleasing. If this could be made in a scent-free option, this product would be great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to toss this because the scent is horrible.</li>
            <li> A great product, easier on hands than alcohol based products,&lt;br /&gt;fine lavender scent brightens the room&lt;br /&gt;soft gel absorbs easily</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, works well!  Just wish it was alcohol free...</li>
            <li> Nice, soft and smells good. Much better than regular sanitizing product..</li>
            <li> I wanted something even my three year old grandson could use. This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I will only buy organic from now on. Does not dry out your hands and the smell is very calming.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars - but my OCD control freak girlfriend always notices &amp;#34;the smell.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s &amp;#34;smells like&amp;#34; you put hand sanitizer on your hands!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I did, and what is the problem exactly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that is smells like lavender hand sanitizer. And some people just cannot be comfortable with other people &amp;#34;introducing&amp;#34; new smells into their precious environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again - 5 star product, reduced to 3 stars because of 1 star ball and chain.</li>
            <li> I came across this at the health food store in my neighborhood and absolutely love it. I travel alot and it comes in handy. I had several passengers on the plane ask  what it was and where they can get it. I gave the flight attendant the bottle that I had \\&quot;just because\\&quot;. It just great and I love it. I am going to buy all of my sisters and friends a bottle to try...</li>
            <li> this is great...sanitizes your hands and smells heavenly</li>
            <li> Lovely scent but a little drying on the hands.</li>
            <li> Strong smell but works well</li>
            <li> With a newborn at home I find myself washing and sanitizing my hands more than usual. I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands and had a very nice scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries with a strong scent of alcohol, but my hands are not drying out. Its a good product.</li>
            <li> As someone else mentioned, I think, the product is a bit gritty, which is sort of weird. I would have expected a clear gel-type consistency. But it does smell great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. Smells great too. Fills up the room with a nice aroma after I use it on my hands</li>
            <li> BEST hand sanitizer ever</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. As for how well it works I&#x27;m not sure, but love the smell.</li>
            <li> I like the idea behind this product, but I found the smell very strong. I have not used it very much because of the strong smell. I felt like I had to wash my hands after I used it, although I did buy this to use while handling a baby, so I might have been sensitive.</li>
            <li> To be clear on my 2 star rating, while I rate the quality of the sanitizer higher, the smell is way too strong and musky to use. Neither myself, or my husband could tolerate the scent. It literally made my eyes tear.</li>
            <li> You can relax as you wash away the day! Lol this stuff smells and feels great! I bought this as a gift for my daughters teacher. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and I am constantly washing or cleaning my hands with alcohol based sanitizers. EO sanitizer is gentle on my skin and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, my clients love that it has a subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that it&#x27;s rather expensive, so, I use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AWESOME. DOES NOT DRY HANDS FEELS GOOD SMELLS HEAVENLY. HEAVY LAVENDER SCENT.&lt;br /&gt;CAN BE FOUND AT MOST PUBLIX  EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sanitizing gel I&#x27;ve ever used!!! I usually don&#x27;t like floral scents but the lavender is very mild. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most sanitizers do.</li>
            <li> This hand sanitizer is a real improvement over the hand sanitizer I&#x27;ve been buying at the grocery store.  Smells great and after I use it, my hands feel clean.  A little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the EO hand sanitizing products in general. This is the one of choice for my office. It smells great and is a quick fix for those times I can&#x27;t just run off and wash my hands when I want to! The size is good because it lasts long enough (but when it&#x27;s finally empty I can use the big size to refill!). I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. I use it at the office when I absolutely cannot get to the bathroom to wash my hands after a sneeze or a quick snack. It smells wonderful and gentle on the hands.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural product that effectively killed germs. Reviews for this product were good. I personally do not like the scent. It&#x27;s a harsh, strong smell. Not appealing.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Nice smell, seems to work, not a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is the only hand sanitizer I have used that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.  In fact, it seems to moisturize and soften them.  Great product!  All of EO&#x27;s scents are very natural-smelling , but the lavender is, by far, the best and the scent is simply lovely.  Whenever I use it, people (including strangers) as me what perfume I just applied.</li>
            <li> nice smell!  after months of nasty purell and other sanitizers this has a lovely non-fake lavender scent.  a winner in our book</li>
            <li> This product has an overwhelmingly artificial odor.&lt;br /&gt;It also looks like congealed spit.&lt;br /&gt;It creates a layer over the skin that does not easily absorb.&lt;br /&gt;Thus you can end up tasting it or getting it in ur eye or food if ur  not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return it but the first time I called I was put on hold and then disconnected.&lt;br /&gt;The second time I called I could not understand the Mid-East accent of the man on the other end.&lt;br /&gt;He ended up not being able to hear me or claiming he could not hear me.&lt;br /&gt;So, I hung up angry.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t return the item because I needed a code to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am stuck with an item I won&#x27;t use and don&#x27;t want to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never order from this company again.</li>
            <li> nice light lavender scent and leaves a clean feeling on your hands - no soapy feel left behind.  have purchased already a few times.</li>
            <li> This is so much better to use than the other sanitizers with all the chemicals in them. Plus, it smells nice. Then again, I love the smell of lavender.</li>
            <li> Very strong smelling, but soft for multiple uses</li>
            <li> I love EO products in general, but this is one of my favorites. A light lavender scent and it doesn&#x27;t seem as drying as regular hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li> I hesitated on buying this because of the price but so glad I did. It smells fantastic! It is definitely a strong smell but not overpowering or obnoxious. And the smell doesn&#x27;t linger too long. I bought it because I&#x27;ve been trying to not buy the typical hand sanitizers after reading the negative health risks, particularly for kids.  We will definitely continue to buy this to have at home but I just wish it was  a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> Another great product from EO!  This organic plant based alternative to chemical laden hand sanitizers has organic lavender essential oil blend to naturally clean &amp; refreshen hands while soothing jojoba oil nourishes &amp; moisturizes. It&#x27;s 99.9% effective against most common germs that cause illness.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful hand sanitizer.  Natural, fragrant, moisturizing.  I wish there were refills, as we go through the 8 oz. gel quickly.  The lavender fragrance is not overpowering, and is suitable for men to use.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a doctor and keep this in my office. Patients comment on the pleasant smell and I enjoy using a less toxic product whenever I am able. The smell also gives me a relaxing dose of aromatherapy between patients.</li>
            <li> Our daughter was using this hand Sanitizer, and I liked the lavendar scent. E keep it in the cars because it&#x27;s especially good after filling up with gas.</li>
            <li> Favorite hand sanitizer!!!! Leaves my hands feeling smooth and smelling good! My co-workers also love it, they&#x27;re always at my desk getting a pump of the good stuff. One even bought a commercial size for her desk because she loves it. If you work in a spa and need to sanitize your hands frequently I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for my car, it&#x27;s so much nicer than the usual alcohol based hand sanitizer....when out shopping during the winter months especially, I just run a dab thru my hands after I get back to my car from those retail stores where the entire world has handled those items before me.....keeps those cold germs at bay....</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells so much better than regular hand sanitizer and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands as dry as the regular stuff either.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and the scent is amazing.  You will not be disappointed.  The price is right for any budget.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of lavender instead of alcohol. Still does what it is supposed to - sanitize.</li>
            <li> Very nice hand sanitizer. Great lavender smell, I receive complements every time I use, people always ask me what is this great smell?  For some people the smell can be kind of strong, but me and my family loved!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the norm at my workplace for employees to take as many steps to keep their hands clean as possible due to the nature of our work. More than one co-worker and I have found that the conventional ethanol-based hand sanitizers that we employees use at our &amp;#34;non-dirty work desks&amp;#34; dry our hands quickly. I&#x27;ve found that using this hand sanitizer dries my hands a lot slower than conventional hand sanitizers, which is especially wonderful during the winter! The scent *is* strong, although I like it, and so do my co-workers whose desks are near mine. Granted, conventional hand sanitizers also can have a strong scent, albeit not as strong--but not as pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance without all of the weird chemicals!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This products has ingredients that I am comfortable using to sanitize. And the lavender fragrance is strong but very pleasant also.</li>
            <li> love it! makes my hands soft!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product at my physical therapist&#x27;s office. It was her go-to hand sanitizer and I LOVED the scent. She let me try some and I was impressed by how it only took 1 or 2 short pumps to get enough to do the job so, although it is a little pricey compared with mainstream products, a bottle will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottles - one for home, and one for work where the soap they provide in the restrooms is kind of harsh and drying, whereas EO has a moisturizer in it. It&#x27;s quickly absorbed and leaves no residue at all, although the scent lingers a little while on the hands which, for me, is a bonus. It&#x27;s clearly lavender but there&#x27;s a very very subtle top note of something that might be sandalwood (??); whatever it is, it complements the lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and I will be buying more in the future. If you like lavender but don&#x27;t like overpowering or cloying versions of it, I bet you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but nice quality, great fragrance. I like the alternative to alcohol based products.</li>
            <li> Good scent and it seems be ample supply so you do not run out in a week like many other hand sanitizers.</li>
