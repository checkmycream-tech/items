            <li>They really get areas you can&#x27;t get to, the edge between your nose and face is a great.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, just apply pressure over the pimple with the tool</li>
            <li>The kit includes 5 tools that vary in size and shape so any blemish is easily extracted.  </li>
            <li>The case makes it easy to keep everything together rather than having them get lost all over the place.</li>

            <li>It has all the tools you need for clean, scar free blackhead remover.  </li>
            <li>These seem like they&#x27;d be most effective against large blemishes and blackheads, which I don&#x27;t really have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to give it more time and practice.</li>

            <li>It came in a cute little pouch that holds each tool nicely.</li>

            <li>kit is super nice and WAY cheaper than buying even a single tool at the store.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>A nice touch is the many different sizes, making extraction possible for any size blackhead.</li>
            <li>I live this set!!!</li>
            <li>I am so glad to finally have the right tools for them.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I do like the tools very much.</li>
            <li>My teen is gonna love it.  </li>
            <li>i really love it because its have different blackhead remover.</li>
            <li>but most of these heads on the tools are much larger than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>Most of the spaces just popped out white junk.</li>
            <li>Most of the spaces just popped out white junk.  </li>
            <li>love how this product brings 5 double sized tools!</li>
            <li>Put &amp;#34;em in my first aid kit with tweezers, scissors, etc.</li>
            <li>but I do suggest washing/sterilizing them before your first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this in amazon, this will help me remove my blackhead and will save me money from going to facial  salon just to remove them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend to anyone with skin ;)</li>
            <li>I probably would have given a higher rating if there were instructions for each tool included.</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>really like them and also they are easy to clean using hot water and a little soap.</li>
            <li>really like them and also they are easy to clean using hot water and a little soap.</li>
            <li>Also my son is 16 and started working at a popular fast food restaurant and the grease from the food was causing a lot of black heads</li>
            <li>Just got today, seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>kit is made of quality materials that work very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a quality product that fits my needs very well.</li>
            <li>With these tools, I am able to remove those with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>These are built well and are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks for giving us discounted items in exchange of a product review.</li>
            <li>Although I really don&#x27;t know how to use all of the tools..</li>
            <li>This kit worked really well</li>
            <li>both the instruments and case are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The ones that I have previously owned broke very easily.</li>
            <li>It seems that the old saying about how if it&#x27;s too good to be true, it&#x27;s probably false applies to this do-it-yourself kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who wants a way to get out any and all blackheads.</li>
            <li>She referred me to a spa that gives special facial and removes milia...</li>
            <li>but it is very useful in the long run.</li>
            <li>The case zips closed so you can easily bring it with you when travelling.  </li>
            <li>sure, for $50 a half hour.</li>
            <li>I love how well it gets rid of black heads.</li>
            <li>A decent blackhead remover kit.</li>
            <li>I love the little zip up case</li>
            <li>I love the little zip up case</li>
            <li>She is a teenager and finds it easy to use and works extremely well for her.</li>
            <li>Each tool has a grip in the center that&#x27;s comfortable and prevents slips.</li>
            <li>The tools feel heavy for their size and I am confident they will hold up.</li>
            <li>great sturdy product, just be careful not to push too hard</li>
            <li>I will say that the tool intended to lance is not sharp enough or small enough to be of much use, but the rest of the tools are great.</li>
            <li>you just have to follow the instructions and not try to pop things that aren&#x27;t ready to be popped and most importantly go slow.</li>
            <li>So great, my daughter took this kit from me! :(</li>
            <li>Bend easy with heavy pushing.</li>
            <li>just make sure that you don&#x27;t push to hard</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product and it arrived early and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
            <li>I have small blemishes, which I guess can&#x27;t be removed easily or require practice to remove.</li>
            <li>Either way dirty or not, since this is going on my face I like to be 100% sure that it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>The tools themselves are high quality and will last for quite awhile!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a kit like this for a reasonable price for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I found the loops to also leave the least amount of redness and irritation when done better than the spoon styles where it leaves circle red marks from the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of videos online to see how to use the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Most of the time, blemishes or blackheads are tough to remove.</li>
            <li>You really need to be careful when you use these tools to attempt to remove blackhead/whiteheads.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely well made, very sturdy, and come in a variety of sizes and styles to tackle any blemish.</li>
            <li>To anyone wondering if a set of blackhead remover tools like these is something they need or can use, I recommend watching a few how-to videos to see how to use them properly and exactly what they&#x27;re used for.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m willing to give it more time and practice.</li>

            <li> This set works great, it took a little practice to get the technique</li>
            <li> It came in a cute little pouch that holds each tool nicely.</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t work very well because the loops are so huge.</li>
            <li> I could not get my own personal photos of this product to upload.  </li>

            <li> love how this product brings 5 double sized tools!</li>
            <li> Put &amp;#34;em in my first aid kit with tweezers, scissors, etc.</li>
            <li> but I do suggest washing/sterilizing them before your first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this in amazon, this will help me remove my blackhead and will save me money from going to facial  salon just to remove them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend to anyone with skin ;)</li>
            <li> I probably would have given a higher rating if there were instructions for each tool included.</li>
            <li> No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li> and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> really like them and also they are easy to clean using hot water and a little soap.</li>
            <li> really like them and also they are easy to clean using hot water and a little soap.</li>
            <li> Also my son is 16 and started working at a popular fast food restaurant and the grease from the food was causing a lot of black heads</li>
            <li> Just got today, seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> kit is made of quality materials that work very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a quality product that fits my needs very well.</li>
            <li> With these tools, I am able to remove those with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> These are built well and are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks for giving us discounted items in exchange of a product review.</li>
            <li> Although I really don&#x27;t know how to use all of the tools..</li>
            <li> This kit worked really well</li>
            <li> both the instruments and case are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The ones that I have previously owned broke very easily.</li>
            <li> It seems that the old saying about how if it&#x27;s too good to be true, it&#x27;s probably false applies to this do-it-yourself kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who wants a way to get out any and all blackheads.</li>
            <li> She referred me to a spa that gives special facial and removes milia...</li>
            <li> but it is very useful in the long run.</li>
            <li> The case zips closed so you can easily bring it with you when travelling.  </li>
            <li> sure, for $50 a half hour.</li>
            <li> I love how well it gets rid of black heads.</li>
            <li> A decent blackhead remover kit.</li>
            <li> I love the little zip up case</li>
            <li> I love the little zip up case</li>
            <li> She is a teenager and finds it easy to use and works extremely well for her.</li>
            <li> Each tool has a grip in the center that&#x27;s comfortable and prevents slips.</li>
            <li> The tools feel heavy for their size and I am confident they will hold up.</li>
            <li> great sturdy product, just be careful not to push too hard</li>
            <li> I will say that the tool intended to lance is not sharp enough or small enough to be of much use, but the rest of the tools are great.</li>
            <li> you just have to follow the instructions and not try to pop things that aren&#x27;t ready to be popped and most importantly go slow.</li>
            <li> So great, my daughter took this kit from me! :(</li>
            <li> Bend easy with heavy pushing.</li>
            <li> just make sure that you don&#x27;t push to hard</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product and it arrived early and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I have small blemishes, which I guess can&#x27;t be removed easily or require practice to remove.</li>
            <li> Either way dirty or not, since this is going on my face I like to be 100% sure that it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> The tools themselves are high quality and will last for quite awhile!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a kit like this for a reasonable price for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I found the loops to also leave the least amount of redness and irritation when done better than the spoon styles where it leaves circle red marks from the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of videos online to see how to use the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Most of the time, blemishes or blackheads are tough to remove.</li>
            <li> You really need to be careful when you use these tools to attempt to remove blackhead/whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely well made, very sturdy, and come in a variety of sizes and styles to tackle any blemish.</li>
            <li> To anyone wondering if a set of blackhead remover tools like these is something they need or can use, I recommend watching a few how-to videos to see how to use them properly and exactly what they&#x27;re used for.  </li>
            <li> He said it was hard at first</li>
            <li> Some of the spots on my face are just stubborn and require a harsh squeeze, but I&#x27;m hoping that with these new tools maybe I can stop my face from clogging up so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the spots on my face are just stubborn and require a harsh squeeze, but I&#x27;m hoping that with these new tools maybe I can stop my face from clogging up so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This kit is much more difficult to use than expected.</li>
            <li> A perfect kit for those nasty pimples, black heads and white heads.</li>
            <li> Works very well in hard to get places like in your ear.</li>
            <li> The quality of the tools and the hard case seems very durable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to get one of these kits for so long now.</li>
            <li> I took a star off for the lack of instructions and other reasons explained further in the rest of my review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no scars or major harsh lotions for her face.</li>
            <li> You risk cutting into your skin surrounding the blackhead you&#x27;re trying to get rid of, only to be left with a large, red, irritated area of skin that may end up with a scab.  </li>
            <li> I used the tools on my face and they helped get rid of black and white heads that  I couldn&#x27;t get out without any other tool.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> so be careful as to not overdo it.</li>
            <li> This product is not exactly easy to use and definitely takes some getting used to if you have never used tools like this before.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of pressure goes a long way with you</li>
            <li> Other than those details, once I washed my tools and got some instructions, they were easier to use than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The quality on these seem acceptable, and the set I got doesn&#x27;t have any sharp unfinished edges as other reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> Somewhat scary to use at first</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me they were due to aging.</li>
            <li> This case was extremely convenient when it came to traveling.</li>
            <li> kit arrived on time in very minimal packaging.</li>
            <li> I like the entire set but loops are a little thick which makes it harder to do extractions with out hurting the client.</li>
            <li> and yes it does leave a little mark on your skin due to the pressure</li>
            <li> The edges are very sharp and has a metallic smell.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a sturdy black head remover kit that is not going to break after 1 or 2 uses, this is your kit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are hidden in the tight corners around your nose or even your ear.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other black head removers in the past and none were as sturdy as these.</li>
            <li> I have a few black heads and pimples which I always try to pop using my fingers, which leaves a lot scarring</li>
            <li> Well made little kit.</li>
            <li> They come in a variety of sizes, are heavy, and well-made.</li>
            <li> a few marks were</li>
            <li> The tool will leave behind a red dot from the pressure used, but it will fade in a few days.</li>
            <li> My face and back are full of those nasty blemishes with this product I can removed them myself.</li>
            <li> I got this Blackhead Remover Dermatologist Grade Kit by Art Naturals to help get rid of my annoying blackheads and this kit does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do!</li>
            <li> I am the amateur dermatologist in the family, and my job just got easier.  </li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, it was not too hard to do.</li>
            <li> I am a fanatic when it comes to using Blackhead removers.</li>
            <li> They are not best suited for small blemishes.</li>
            <li> A couple of the tools looked a little dirty to me.</li>
            <li> Before this, I used my fingers to pop any blemish or pimple that I had, leaving behind scars and infection.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that want to get rid of blackheads, whiteheads and/or any pimple without having an infection or leaving a scar behind.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there are no instructions/guide as to what each tool and the tip does and what to use it on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there are no instructions/guide as to what each tool and the tip does and what to use it on.</li>
            <li> It covers all sizes so you can get all those tough areas!!</li>
            <li> In addition, using these tools can be painful.  </li>
            <li> or you will end up with damaged tissue :(</li>
            <li> I hate having blackheads</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever ordered.</li>

            <li> Just got today, seems to work very well. Comes in a nice zipper case, looks like professional tools, better than the picture. I have never used one before, very easy to use. I&#x27;m going to try it on my teenager and I&#x27;ll post how well that goes. Works very well in hard to get places like in your ear. Better than using a bobby pin. Would recommend. I bought at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Amazing kit with quality tools , stainless surgical steel i believe . It comes in that very nice , white leather pouch . Really loving it , would recommend it 100% .</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this product, easy to use.The case is super chic.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very good price as well!</li>
            <li> Nice quality, but you have to search the Internet to find out how to use....this should have come with instructions.</li>
            <li> Like this product. Good quality and seems like it will last. Does an affective job at removal of blackheads.</li>
            <li> This kit is much more difficult to use than expected. I will keep trying. I&#x27;ve had some health issues and my skin has flared up with acne so I&#x27;d like to see it work. I&#x27;m willing to give it more time and practice.</li>
            <li> Awesome kit has a tool for everything. Gets the job done quickly and easily in the morning to get ready for the day. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see this arrive in the mail. I get blackheads and whiteheads on my nose. This kit was the perfect solution to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is made of quality materials that work very well. They come in a variety of sizes, are heavy, and well-made. The only thing that I wish is that the kit came with instructions for use. That said, there are several videos on YouTube that show how to use these. They helped me greatly. Although, I still have not found out what the triangular head is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a quality product that fits my needs very well. I&#x27;m thrilled with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> Blackhead Remover Dermatologist Grade Kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Art Naturals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit came in a padded box and appropriate shipped for this item . Shipped  in a timely manner.The kit itself came in a zippered white travel/storage case. which I loved because I won&#x27;t have to worry about losing the tools. Each of 5 tools was made out of sturdy silver metal . A lot sturdier than I thought they would be. I used the tools on my face and they helped get rid of black and white heads that  I couldn&#x27;t get out without any other tool. I would strongly recommend this kit to others. I could not get my own personal photos of this product to upload.  But I uploaded one from the Amazon .Down below is a link to the item on Amazon. I receive this product at a reduced price from AMZ Reviewtrader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZDOCD08?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00</li>
            <li> I like how this kit came with 5 different tools and a nice pouch to keep it in.&lt;br /&gt;Each tool has sort of a weight to it. I like that because it makes it feel like it has more quality. It&#x27;s good for me because I&#x27;m a first timer. Even without instructions, I could figure out myself.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Case was white when I think it should have been a darker color to keep it cleaner longer just in case u want to travel with it however all in all I love the product. I am always picking &amp; digging in my face to ensure no acne especially blackheads. This product is defenitely a plus for my own personal use. Again I love and would recommend and purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is really a terrific set. Most of the time, blemishes or blackheads are tough to remove. They are hidden in the tight corners around your nose or even your ear. With these tools, I am able to remove those with minimal effort. I am kicking myself for not purcashing this item sooner.</li>
            <li> They are a very nice kit. My son likes the kit. I recieved these as a promotion for free to do this review.</li>
            <li> Awesome, safe dermatologist kit for home use.  My teen is gonna love it.  We all know they tend to pick and pick at their acne blemishes. Which can leave scarring. Also they are just transferring germs from using their fingers.  These hygienic blackhead remover tools are the answer.  I do wish it had come with some sort of guide on which tools are used for what but will take into a dermatologists office and ask.  I purchased this product at a reduced rate to review and am very happy I did.</li>
            <li> i really love it because its have different blackhead remover. I like the design, and how easy to use it. I already recommend it to my sister. Its so useful specially on weekend where I do my beauty regime.</li>
            <li> This product was a great gift for my son who is start to get blackheads. great product</li>
            <li> I am a fanatic when it comes to using Blackhead removers. I use them constantly. These are built well and are very sturdy. Some of the reviews say that this brand does not work well, but I did not have that experience. In the store, just one would cost about three dollars, so I think it&#x27;s  a good buy. :)</li>
            <li> The tools have a sold feel and the case it well put together. I just need to learn how to use all of these tools.</li>
            <li> great sturdy product, just be careful not to push too hard or you will end up with damaged tissue :(</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister. She said it was amazing and the tools were easy to use. The case was sleek. The tools cleaned easily. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have purchased other black head removers in the past and none were as sturdy as these. The ones that I have previously owned broke very easily. These are formed where I do not see myself being able to break them ever. They come in an easy to use storage pouch which helps you keep up with them and keep everything in place. I am very happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a sturdy black head remover kit that is not going to break after 1 or 2 uses, this is your kit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I REVEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW</li>
            <li> This is what you see doctors using to extract blackheads and pop whiteheads and stuff. Now you can do it yourself, and its fun!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:650e1eab769b6babe6a181b78093c2ed]] I am super happy I recieved this free to do a review on This is A must have for everyone Teen-100 years old, Comes with everything you could need to remove Black heads from your face or Anywhere needed! The Quality is compared to none better Very impressed with the price for such a great product. The carry case zips on all 3 sides and is made to last. Works as it is said to..No issues or complaints at all.</li>
            <li> They get the job done SOMETIMES but most of these heads on the tools are much larger than I thought they would be. They are not best suited for small blemishes.</li>
            <li> Well built and Just what I was looking for. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> You really need to be careful when you use these tools to attempt to remove blackhead/whiteheads.  You risk cutting into your skin surrounding the blackhead you&#x27;re trying to get rid of, only to be left with a large, red, irritated area of skin that may end up with a scab.  In addition, using these tools can be painful.  It seems that the old saying about how if it&#x27;s too good to be true, it&#x27;s probably false applies to this do-it-yourself kit.</li>
            <li> This product is not exactly easy to use and definitely takes some getting used to if you have never used tools like this before. The case that they come in comes in handy for keeping up with everything.</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use and really all the different options of tools to use.</li>
            <li> Actually pretty effective. I got the kit and started poking around my face at areas that seemed to have blackheads. Most of the spaces just popped out white junk. Some of the spots on my face are just stubborn and require a harsh squeeze, but I&#x27;m hoping that with these new tools maybe I can stop my face from clogging up so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is super nice and WAY cheaper than buying even a single tool at the store. I love the little zip up case it comes with and everything is very nice and clean inside. Excellent buy. I gave it four stars instead of five though simply because it couldn&#x27;t get all my blackheads out and I still had to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Well made instruments and case.</li>
            <li> This set works great, it took a little practice to get the technique right but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>

            <li> Great for popping pimples. I have a few black heads and pimples which I always try to pop using my fingers, which leaves a lot scarring I am so glad to finally have the right tools for them.</li>
            <li> Great kit, everything you need to get those black and whiteheads out. However I wish it came with some information on what each tip should be used for.</li>
            <li> A perfect kit for those nasty pimples, black heads and white heads. My face and back are full of those nasty blemishes with this product I can removed them myself. Without leaving my house for someone else to touch and see. Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this product brings 5 double sized tools! They come in different sizes for all kinds of blemishes. These are clean extractors that you can sterilize at home and they won&#x27;t rust. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in a very nice kit bag made from leather and has a zipper. The tools are accommodated very nice inside. You can carry it in your purse or just keep it safe at home in its place. Very nice white bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample and review.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a kit like this for a reasonable price for a long time.  It has all the tools you need for clean, scar free blackhead remover.  I am the amateur dermatologist in the family, and my job just got easier.  Like the surgical grade metal for easy sterilization.  Great price!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Grand daughter and she absolutely loves it. She is a teenager and finds it easy to use and works extremely well for her. no scars or major harsh lotions for her face.</li>
            <li> I like this kit quite a bit! It is sturdy and well made. The case is nice too!! Perfect tools!</li>
            <li> Various tools for a variety of applications. Put &amp;#34;em in my first aid kit with tweezers, scissors, etc. Great addition!</li>
            <li> This product is the best on because it works brilliantly. Before this, I used my fingers to pop any blemish or pimple that I had, leaving behind scars and infection. With this tool kit you don&#x27;t have to worry about anything. It&#x27;s easy to use, just apply pressure over the pimple with the tool and that&#x27;s it. The tool will leave behind a red dot from the pressure used, but it will fade in a few days. I recommend this to anyone that want to get rid of blackheads, whiteheads and/or any pimple without having an infection or leaving a scar behind. Of course, you have to disinfect the tools and your skin before and after every use.</li>
            <li> Great for the price !</li>
            <li> Like this product. Good quality and seems like it will last. Does an affective job at removal of blackheads.</li>
            <li> A decent blackhead remover kit. I took a star off for the lack of instructions and other reasons explained further in the rest of my review.&lt;br /&gt;The kit arrived on time in very minimal packaging. There are 5 tools total that come in a zippered pleather case. No instructions are provided so I suggest looking some up on Google or YouTube if you need to see how they are used. I honestly had no idea what tool to use for anything since this is my first blackhead removal kit.The tools themselves seem like they are made well but I do suggest washing/sterilizing them before your first use. A couple of the tools looked a little dirty to me. They did not look used but possibly from packaging. Either way dirty or not, since this is going on my face I like to be 100% sure that it&#x27;s clean. Other than those details, once I washed my tools and got some instructions, they were easier to use than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my daughter, she likes using it because it better than using her finger nails. When she uses her nails it would pinch the skin that will cause the skin to break resulting in a possible scar. This item has helped to eliminate that. Thanks</li>
            <li> Goodbye blackheads, that&#x27;s what you can say after you will try this blackhead removal kit. Thanks for giving us discounted items in exchange of a product review.</li>
            <li> I like the entire set but loops are a little thick which makes it harder to do extractions with out hurting the client.</li>
            <li> This is a good set of tools to help remove blackheads, I like the case because the color makes it easy to locate.  Got this for my son, because I have a similar one and I like the variety of tools.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with a discount code and I have to say I enjoy it a lot! It came in a cute little pouch that holds each tool nicely. Each tool is sturdy and the various tools help you with whatever you need done.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit rouse for acne and it&#x27;s so cute! Love that it comes as a set for everything you need!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to get one of these kits for so long now. I watched my friend use one and went on the hunt for my own. The tools are not flimsy and are good quality. Being able to safely have more control over my face has truly helped me to &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; at it less with my fingers. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these and use them as part of my skincare routine, but they just aren&#x27;t for me. These seem like they&#x27;d be most effective against large blemishes and blackheads, which I don&#x27;t really have. I have small blemishes, which I guess can&#x27;t be removed easily or require practice to remove. The quality on these seem acceptable, and the set I got doesn&#x27;t have any sharp unfinished edges as other reviews have stated. The case is obviously cheap but well made, and good enough to hold these tools. To anyone wondering if a set of blackhead remover tools like these is something they need or can use, I recommend watching a few how-to videos to see how to use them properly and exactly what they&#x27;re used for.  Product sample provided at no cost for evaluation and reviewing purposes. ----------------------------------------- Edit: After I finished my review, I gave this set to my mother to use. She was skeptical at first, but after trying them she found they worked for her, and now she really likes them! I changed my rating from 3 stars to 4 to reflect this, since it seems I am the anomaly here.</li>
            <li> nice case would help if there were instructions</li>
            <li> These tools are really huge.  When I used the extractor, I end up with a big red circle on my face.  And they don&#x27;t work very well because the loops are so huge.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my son and he loved it. He said it was hard at first but once he got the hang of it he liked the results. This item is great for teenagers who are hitting puberty. Also my son is 16 and started working at a popular fast food restaurant and the grease from the food was causing a lot of black heads this product helped with that problem.</li>
            <li> Somewhat scary to use at first but it is very useful in the long run. Just keep them clean.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever ordered. These are very low quality blackhead removers. The edges are very sharp and has a metallic smell. I will say that the case is great.</li>
            <li> Very reliable, sturdy product, clean edges smooth grip and fixtures. They really get areas you can&#x27;t get to, the edge between your nose and face is a great. It allows for specific targeting of key areas. I would recommend this product and it arrived early and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> Although I really don&#x27;t know how to use all of the tools..lol... it&#x27;s professional looking and very nice tools! Love that there&#x27;s a case to hold all of them!</li>
            <li> Great quality but I wish it came with instructions</li>
            <li> I hate having blackheads so i let the professionals handle it for me but it costing me more money. I&#x27;m glad I found this in amazon, this will help me remove my blackhead and will save me money from going to facial  salon just to remove them.</li>
            <li> Nice tools to have in your beauty arsenal.  Each has specific uses, the case was nicely constructed and zippered close for handy storage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and compact ! It looks just as good as the display pic and I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> I got this Blackhead Remover Dermatologist Grade Kit by Art Naturals to help get rid of my annoying blackheads and this kit does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do! I love that the tools come in different shapes and sizes which helps with even the most annoying blackheads! I really like the case that this kit comes with so that you can easily store it rather in your house or when you travel! This kit worked really well and yes it does leave a little mark on your skin due to the pressure but it goes away within minutes! The tools themselves are high quality and will last for quite awhile! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Received these to review, and I&#x27;m very happy with them. They&#x27;re extremely well made, very sturdy, and come in a variety of sizes and styles to tackle any blemish. The case is a nice addition too, as it keeps the tools all in one place and well organized. Great product from a great seller!</li>
            <li> First, let me say that the white leather case is REALLY top-notch!  The blackhead extractors are also top of the line.  They will save a trip, time and money to go and have them extracted!</li>
            <li> Well made little kit. Very reasonable price. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone with skin ;)</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the tools and the case !</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  The kit includes 5 tools that vary in size and shape so any blemish is easily extracted.  The case zips closed so you can easily bring it with you when travelling.  Each tool has a grip in the center that&#x27;s comfortable and prevents slips.</li>
            <li> https://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ref_&#x3D;ya_your_reviews&amp;sort_by&#x3D;MostRecentReview</li>
            <li> This kit is pretty nice. The case is a great touch and it is very well made. The tools feel heavy for their size and I am confident they will hold up. A nice touch is the many different sizes, making extraction possible for any size blackhead. I would suggest you watch a video on Youtube of how to use these before trying them. There is a learning curve. Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on the milia that have appeared on my face. My dermatologist told me they were due to aging. Great. She referred me to a spa that gives special facial and removes milia... sure, for $50 a half hour. No thanks. I researched it myself and decided to buy this product to treat my own skin. I do like the tools very much. But they come without instructions. I guess they figure if you are ordering tools like this you already know how to use them. It&#x27;s really the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars. After some trial and error, I did successfully remove many of the milia from my face. Once I got the hang of it, it was not too hard to do. I will say that the tool intended to lance is not sharp enough or small enough to be of much use, but the rest of the tools are great.</li>
            <li> The set came as described. Didn&#x27;t know what each tool was for or how to use.  I probably would have given a higher rating if there were instructions for each tool included.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful I love it just make sure that you don&#x27;t push to hard cause I have a few marks were I went to deep and now I&#x27;m sore from it.</li>
            <li> It works well you just have to follow the instructions and not try to pop things that aren&#x27;t ready to be popped and most importantly go slow.</li>
            <li> This kit is solid both the instruments and case are very sturdy. The case interior feels and looks quite premium and the pockets holding the tools feel solid and snug on the tools. I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who wants a way to get out any and all blackheads.</li>
            <li> What an amazing kit. There are 5 tools in the kit along with a nice sturdy case. There are 3 double ended loop extractors and 2spoon extractors. Unfortunately, there are no instructions/guide as to what each tool and the tip does and what to use it on. Yes, i know its for blackheads but there are all different shapes and sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been experimenting with them to see which ones did the best job. I found that the loop style ones were real easy and all you needed to do was basically swipe or comp the areas and it got a bunch of gunk. I found the loops to also leave the least amount of redness and irritation when done better than the spoon styles where it leaves circle red marks from the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of videos online to see how to use the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like them and also they are easy to clean using hot water and a little soap.</li>
            <li> I live this set!!! It covers all sizes so you can get all those tough areas!!</li>
            <li> Works great! So great, my daughter took this kit from me! :(</li>
            <li> Awesome tools. Bend easy with heavy pushing. But works great!</li>
            <li> Great product, never used these things before but once I got them they were very easy to figure out and get going on cleaning up those stubborn clogged pores. Just a little bit of pressure goes a long way with you so be careful as to not overdo it. Dermatologist grade surgical steel and it convenient travel case makes this a perfect combo for the experienced or the average person with skin concern areas</li>
            <li> This case was extremely convenient when it came to traveling. You never know when you&#x27;re going to need an on the go facial. The case makes it easy to keep everything together rather than having them get lost all over the place. definitely love this product!</li>
            <li> These items are so great! The quality of the tools and the hard case seems very durable</li>
            <li> Great item! I love how well it gets rid of black heads.</li>
