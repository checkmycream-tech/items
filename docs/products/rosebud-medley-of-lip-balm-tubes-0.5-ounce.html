            <li>I  am always looking for good moisturizing balm to get me through Chicago winters.  </li>
            <li>It is not as good of a texture.</li>
            <li>mocha rose and menthol/eucalyptus are great as well.  </li>
            <li>They all have loved them.</li>
            <li>I decided to get this three pack because it seemed like a good deal.  </li>
            <li>They do not smell good to me.  </li>
            <li>I like the original best but</li>

            <li>Works well and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>They smell amazing.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the mocha rose at all.</li>
            <li>good thing of this product: it make my lip more moisturizer and feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>They are nice and I&#x27;ll keep using them by accepting that they require re-application every hour or so.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is like petroleum jelly with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>The plain flavor is amazing, awesome, and perfect.</li>
            <li>All in perfectly convenient tubes, so no mess on fingers!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never tried the mocha rose variety and I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>The menthol rose might have been a better one to try.</li>
            <li>Awesome product and natural too, cant beat it.</li>
            <li>Of the three &amp;#34;flavors,&amp;#34; the mocha rose one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The Mocha Rose flavor is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is the mocha rose (</li>
            <li>I love every one of these balms and was thrilled with the packaging they came in.</li>
            <li>I used to have a tin of the original balm, which I loved except for having to stick my finger in it.  </li>
            <li>love it as lip balm</li>
            <li>The tubes are fantastic!</li>
            <li>for many years</li>
            <li>I will be getting more.</li>
            <li>The rosebud scented one smells the best, but the formula is the same for all three.  </li>
            <li>I have used the tins for 7 or 8 years and love the tins</li>
            <li>You can always depend on Rosebud products working and getting the most for your money.  </li>
            <li>Love this gloss set....</li>
            <li>The mocha scent smells like most coffee scented balms and salves.</li>
            <li>All in all I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the tube even better, so I don&#x27;t have to dig my finger in the balm..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering a couple more to have on hand for hostess-type gifts throughout the year.</li>
            <li>three tubes were in it. :)</li>
            <li>Love that it comes in tubes and not the tins.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the mocha scented one</li>
            <li>They fit nicely into my purses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tin is so cute that I am keeping it even after the balms are used up.  </li>
            <li>I love Rosebud Salve and purchased these to keep in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I just love this item.  </li>
            <li>but this item does and love the tin it comes in.</li>
            <li>and you will fall in love with Rosebud, too</li>
            <li>The original smelled nice and floral scented.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan and strongly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand for a while and was so excited to find it on amazon!</li>
            <li>I have used this lip balm for years and was happy to see that they added new packaging.</li>
            <li>When I saw this cute gift set available here, I figured I would treat myself.</li>
            <li>They smell better than the original Rosebud salve, but they don&#x27;t keep my lips as moisturized.  </li>
            <li>which would have in turn made it easy to smudge onto my teeth and around the mouth well after having been applied.</li>
            <li>nice smell, really loving the mocha rose, thought it would be my least liked one and ended up being my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have no harmful chemicals in our tubes whatsoever and the tins are tested and are lead free as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard great things about this local phenom (Woodsboro, MD-based Rosebud Perfume Co), but never tried any of their products.</li>
            <li>Has a light glossy feel and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>How happy I was when I saw they had changed up, moved them into tubes and added different flavors.</li>
            <li>I love Rosebud products, and it&#x27;s worth buying all three in this package.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have to worry about it which was a nice change of pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really wanted to love these more.</li>
            <li>:) The balms are very hydrating, and smell lovely.</li>
            <li>This would make a very nice gift set around Christmas, felt like I received a present.</li>
            <li>Worth a shot!</li>
            <li>but I will stick to the original from now on.</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm so much!</li>
            <li>They are plump and flush with pink color, I don&#x27;t even wear lipstick anymore because my lips look so naturally beautiful</li>
            <li>Familiar with product ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more sanitary, it doesn&#x27;t melt all over when it gets hot, and I can leave one in my purse, car, makeup bag, etc.</li>
            <li>are going to come out with a tube for our new rose &amp; Mandarin Lip Balm and Menthol eucalyptus Balm as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The requirements are much more stringent than those of our FDA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for asking and enjoy the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>I love rosebud salve in the regular tin, it has a nice flavor</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite lip product!</li>
            <li>These work great at keeping my very dry lips moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating, the fragrance was ok.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I really do...</li>
            <li>They have a slightly sweet taste as well.</li>
            <li>The other two scents are okay, but they aren&#x27;t as moisturizing as the original rose balm.</li>
            <li>really enjoy this product, the tube is wonderfully convenient and much larger than I thought it would be at just over 4 inches long!</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m getting an adequate amount of product for the price with this 3 tube set.</li>
            <li>I felt I had adequately spoiled myself.  </li>
            <li>The strawberry is a close second, and the original &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is nice overall too, though I don&#x27;t exactly enjoy the perfume-y rose of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>The various flavors/tints have a pleasant, but light scent that goes on smoothly leaving a hint of color that looks natural on just about anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The three of them come in a very pretty tin.</li>
            <li>These might seem pricey but you are actually getting an incredible deal as each tube of balm has much more quantity than other balms</li>
            <li>but I think this is a bonus because it can be too easy to push too much up for this style of tube.</li>
            <li>Wish local stores stocked more of Rosebud&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li>A bit on the pricey side but with Rosebud&#x27;s reputation is well worth it.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance and adds a little color.</li>
            <li>The labelling was askew on the original tube but that is not this companies fault and doesn&#x27;t really bother me anyways as the products are still nice.</li>
            <li>with many lip balms, you do have to reapply throughout the day, but with such fun &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not a chore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love the subtle color or tint, and the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is amazing.</li>
            <li>This balm makes my lip smooth and soft...</li>
            <li>It makes your lips feel so moist and it looks pretty shiny, even though it doesnt feel glossy.</li>
            <li>Although the portion is smaller, I am so glad you came out with ROSEBUD SALVE in a tube.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for putting it in these tubes!  </li>
            <li>long lasting, works great at getting rid of chapped lips.</li>
            <li>When these lip balms arrived in their pretty silver tin</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of shine/gloss, not too sticky, pleasant taste/smell, and barely a hint of sheen pink color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more pricey per ounce than the traditional tin of rosebud salve, but it&#x27;s so much easier to toss in a makeup kit/purse/pocket.</li>
            <li>So far I have only tried the mocha rose.</li>
            <li>The strawberry didn&#x27;t exceed my expectations but alas is still a nice sweet strawberry smelling product (just not as sickly sweet as I would prefer).</li>
            <li>IMHO the mocha is gross, but the flavor disappears very quickly</li>
            <li>After all the rave reviews, of course I had to try one more product to soothe my year-round dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>tin is large and rond.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Nothing compares to this amazing little tube.</li>
            <li>It stays on for a really long time, is not sticky at all, smells nice, and gives my lips a nice subtle shine.</li>
            <li>The woman made her swear not to tell her secret to great skin, which turned out to be putting this stuff on her skin every night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very soothing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We must comply with very rigid EU regulations in order to register our products in the EU and also in Korea.  </li>
            <li>The tubes are very convenient.</li>
            <li>Very greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even really a chocolate person).  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the strawberry flavor here- to me</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I sometimes feel like I have to reapply often, but the pros absolutely outweigh the cons!!!</li>
            <li>next time I may just order the original</li>
            <li>Was excited for the tube version of this product, but it&#x27;s not the same!</li>
            <li>I contacted the company with concerns about the chemicals in the plastic tube, especially BPA, they gave me a quick response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The coffe flavor,in particular, made me feel like I have &amp;#34;coffee breath.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>These tubes may a bit pricier than some other products, but certainly are worth a try if you haven&#x27;t found anything else that alleviates this problem!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for ages, and I love it, but the tins can be messy.</li>
            <li>Bought a set for myself a few months ago, just bought two more for christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize they would come in a really cute round decorative tin.</li>
            <li>I will say, though, that this balm is way better in this new tube format than in the little tub.</li>
            <li>my only complaint is that the mocha rose and strawberry versions seem to be less effective for me.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>The art on the tubes gives a retro look and they come nestled in a very sweet, also retro, round can that can be used for lots of things.</li>
            <li>, it make my lip look darker, so in my opinion if you don&#x27;t sensitive this one is work well!</li>
            <li>it tastes really artificial, while the original rose one is absolutely delicate and lovely.</li>
            <li>I have been buying the Original (the middle one in this pic) for a long time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of using those little tins/pots which Rosebud tends to use, so I&#x27;m glad this alternative is available.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>set is complete with a silver tin, which makes gift-giving a cinch.</li>
            <li>my lip still sensitive with that</li>
            <li>As far as quality...</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>I actually use this year round but more in the colder months.</li>
            <li>I constantly have to put something on my lips to keep them from getting super dry</li>
            <li>The balm itself is a nice thick consistency that will keep your lips moisturized for a long time</li>
            <li>My only (very minor) complaint is that the tubes are kind of large, too big to keep in your pocket.  </li>
            <li>But I suppose that&#x27;s a silly thing to complain about because it&#x27;s more balm for your money!  </li>
            <li>But the Coffee and the strawberry flavors are not really pleasant and the smell is too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>my lips is very sensitive, it always dry and peel</li>
            <li>Rosebud lip balm moisturizes my lips so completely, I can go hours and hours without feeling the need to reapply (but I tend to reapply sooner out of habit from using chapstick for so long, working on breaking that!).</li>

            <li> I will be getting more.</li>
            <li> The rosebud scented one smells the best, but the formula is the same for all three.  </li>
            <li> I have used the tins for 7 or 8 years and love the tins</li>
            <li> You can always depend on Rosebud products working and getting the most for your money.  </li>
            <li> Love this gloss set....</li>
            <li> The mocha scent smells like most coffee scented balms and salves.</li>
            <li> All in all I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the tube even better, so I don&#x27;t have to dig my finger in the balm..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering a couple more to have on hand for hostess-type gifts throughout the year.</li>
            <li> three tubes were in it. :)</li>
            <li> Love that it comes in tubes and not the tins.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the mocha scented one</li>
            <li> They fit nicely into my purses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tin is so cute that I am keeping it even after the balms are used up.  </li>
            <li> I love Rosebud Salve and purchased these to keep in my purse.  </li>
            <li> I just love this item.  </li>
            <li> but this item does and love the tin it comes in.</li>
            <li> and you will fall in love with Rosebud, too</li>
            <li> The original smelled nice and floral scented.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan and strongly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for a while and was so excited to find it on amazon!</li>
            <li> I have used this lip balm for years and was happy to see that they added new packaging.</li>
            <li> When I saw this cute gift set available here, I figured I would treat myself.</li>
            <li> They smell better than the original Rosebud salve, but they don&#x27;t keep my lips as moisturized.  </li>
            <li> which would have in turn made it easy to smudge onto my teeth and around the mouth well after having been applied.</li>
            <li> nice smell, really loving the mocha rose, thought it would be my least liked one and ended up being my favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have no harmful chemicals in our tubes whatsoever and the tins are tested and are lead free as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard great things about this local phenom (Woodsboro, MD-based Rosebud Perfume Co), but never tried any of their products.</li>
            <li> Has a light glossy feel and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> How happy I was when I saw they had changed up, moved them into tubes and added different flavors.</li>
            <li> I love Rosebud products, and it&#x27;s worth buying all three in this package.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have to worry about it which was a nice change of pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really wanted to love these more.</li>
            <li> :) The balms are very hydrating, and smell lovely.</li>
            <li> This would make a very nice gift set around Christmas, felt like I received a present.</li>
            <li> Worth a shot!</li>
            <li> but I will stick to the original from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm so much!</li>
            <li> They are plump and flush with pink color, I don&#x27;t even wear lipstick anymore because my lips look so naturally beautiful</li>
            <li> Familiar with product ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more sanitary, it doesn&#x27;t melt all over when it gets hot, and I can leave one in my purse, car, makeup bag, etc.</li>
            <li> are going to come out with a tube for our new rose &amp; Mandarin Lip Balm and Menthol eucalyptus Balm as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The requirements are much more stringent than those of our FDA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for asking and enjoy the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I love rosebud salve in the regular tin, it has a nice flavor</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lip product!</li>
            <li> These work great at keeping my very dry lips moisturized.  </li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating, the fragrance was ok.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I really do...</li>
            <li> They have a slightly sweet taste as well.</li>
            <li> The other two scents are okay, but they aren&#x27;t as moisturizing as the original rose balm.</li>
            <li> really enjoy this product, the tube is wonderfully convenient and much larger than I thought it would be at just over 4 inches long!</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m getting an adequate amount of product for the price with this 3 tube set.</li>
            <li> I felt I had adequately spoiled myself.  </li>
            <li> The strawberry is a close second, and the original &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is nice overall too, though I don&#x27;t exactly enjoy the perfume-y rose of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> The various flavors/tints have a pleasant, but light scent that goes on smoothly leaving a hint of color that looks natural on just about anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The three of them come in a very pretty tin.</li>
            <li> These might seem pricey but you are actually getting an incredible deal as each tube of balm has much more quantity than other balms</li>
            <li> but I think this is a bonus because it can be too easy to push too much up for this style of tube.</li>
            <li> Wish local stores stocked more of Rosebud&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> A bit on the pricey side but with Rosebud&#x27;s reputation is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fragrance and adds a little color.</li>
            <li> The labelling was askew on the original tube but that is not this companies fault and doesn&#x27;t really bother me anyways as the products are still nice.</li>
            <li> with many lip balms, you do have to reapply throughout the day, but with such fun &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not a chore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love the subtle color or tint, and the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is amazing.</li>
            <li> This balm makes my lip smooth and soft...</li>
            <li> It makes your lips feel so moist and it looks pretty shiny, even though it doesnt feel glossy.</li>
            <li> Although the portion is smaller, I am so glad you came out with ROSEBUD SALVE in a tube.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for putting it in these tubes!  </li>
            <li> long lasting, works great at getting rid of chapped lips.</li>
            <li> When these lip balms arrived in their pretty silver tin</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of shine/gloss, not too sticky, pleasant taste/smell, and barely a hint of sheen pink color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more pricey per ounce than the traditional tin of rosebud salve, but it&#x27;s so much easier to toss in a makeup kit/purse/pocket.</li>
            <li> So far I have only tried the mocha rose.</li>
            <li> The strawberry didn&#x27;t exceed my expectations but alas is still a nice sweet strawberry smelling product (just not as sickly sweet as I would prefer).</li>
            <li> IMHO the mocha is gross, but the flavor disappears very quickly</li>
            <li> After all the rave reviews, of course I had to try one more product to soothe my year-round dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tin is large and rond.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to this amazing little tube.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a really long time, is not sticky at all, smells nice, and gives my lips a nice subtle shine.</li>
            <li> The woman made her swear not to tell her secret to great skin, which turned out to be putting this stuff on her skin every night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very soothing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We must comply with very rigid EU regulations in order to register our products in the EU and also in Korea.  </li>
            <li> The tubes are very convenient.</li>
            <li> Very greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even really a chocolate person).  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the strawberry flavor here- to me</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I sometimes feel like I have to reapply often, but the pros absolutely outweigh the cons!!!</li>
            <li> next time I may just order the original</li>
            <li> Was excited for the tube version of this product, but it&#x27;s not the same!</li>
            <li> I contacted the company with concerns about the chemicals in the plastic tube, especially BPA, they gave me a quick response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The coffe flavor,in particular, made me feel like I have &amp;#34;coffee breath.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These tubes may a bit pricier than some other products, but certainly are worth a try if you haven&#x27;t found anything else that alleviates this problem!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for ages, and I love it, but the tins can be messy.</li>
            <li> Bought a set for myself a few months ago, just bought two more for christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize they would come in a really cute round decorative tin.</li>
            <li> I will say, though, that this balm is way better in this new tube format than in the little tub.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that the mocha rose and strawberry versions seem to be less effective for me.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li> The art on the tubes gives a retro look and they come nestled in a very sweet, also retro, round can that can be used for lots of things.</li>
            <li> , it make my lip look darker, so in my opinion if you don&#x27;t sensitive this one is work well!</li>
            <li> it tastes really artificial, while the original rose one is absolutely delicate and lovely.</li>
            <li> I have been buying the Original (the middle one in this pic) for a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of using those little tins/pots which Rosebud tends to use, so I&#x27;m glad this alternative is available.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> set is complete with a silver tin, which makes gift-giving a cinch.</li>
            <li> my lip still sensitive with that</li>
            <li> As far as quality...</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> I actually use this year round but more in the colder months.</li>
            <li> I constantly have to put something on my lips to keep them from getting super dry</li>
            <li> The balm itself is a nice thick consistency that will keep your lips moisturized for a long time</li>
            <li> My only (very minor) complaint is that the tubes are kind of large, too big to keep in your pocket.  </li>
            <li> But I suppose that&#x27;s a silly thing to complain about because it&#x27;s more balm for your money!  </li>
            <li> But the Coffee and the strawberry flavors are not really pleasant and the smell is too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> my lips is very sensitive, it always dry and peel</li>
            <li> Rosebud lip balm moisturizes my lips so completely, I can go hours and hours without feeling the need to reapply (but I tend to reapply sooner out of habit from using chapstick for so long, working on breaking that!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately as with all other products I have tried this one too needs to be re-applied just as frequently which is why the rating is not higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the effectiveness of this lip balm, it has totally cured my dry lips.</li>
            <li> not sure I particularly like the strawberry and mocha flavors ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and I have tried countless other products over the years.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is the only other lip product that helps me when my lips are dry or chapped.</li>
            <li> product seems to be of high quality, is thick when coming out of the tube, but softens up during application.</li>
            <li> but you cannot leave them in the car during summer, melts and makes a big mess.  </li>
            <li> Used to love my tin rosebud salve but felt a little dirty about always sticking my finger in it.</li>
            <li> I especially prefer the tube over the can, which can be hard to open and close.  </li>
            <li> Or even to tame the occasional flyaway in my hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a year now and will continue using it for as long as it is still sold.</li>
            <li> Not when skiing, disc golfing or any other outdoor winter activities I engage in.  </li>
            <li> The end of the tube was not sealed and when I went to apply the gloss all of the product came out of the other end.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this set recently, desperate for natural ingredients that would truly help my dry lips.</li>
            <li> but I have completely left that issue behind since finding this.  </li>
            <li> The Mocha and Strawberry are definitely NOT my favorite at all.  </li>
            <li> The mocha one went in my sister in law&#x27;s Christmas stocking, so I&#x27;m not sure how that one is.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, altho I like the lip balm, which seems to be the same product in the salve tin,</li>
            <li> They can be a little difficult to squeeze out of the tube</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find lip therapy because I find a lot of them do not moisturize my lips</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the tin version, but this makes it a lot easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about this stuff.</li>
            <li> I go through lip balms like crazy during the winter, and have tubes stashed everywhere from my desk to my car to my purse.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I used to get dry lip scabs that I would bite at and end up tearing my lips, it was terrible and painful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about this stuff. When I showed it to my mother in law and asked her if she&#x27;d ever used it she told me a story of a woman she knew that was in her sixties but didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;a day over 35&amp;#34;. The woman made her swear not to tell her secret to great skin, which turned out to be putting this stuff on her skin every night.&lt;br /&gt;I love it as lip balm but I&#x27;ve also been rubbing it into my hands, heels and under my eyes at night. Worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I have used this lip balm for years and was happy to see that they added new packaging. This balm makes my lip smooth and soft...a must-have for my cosmetics bag!</li>
            <li> I have been buying the Original (the middle one in this pic) for a long time and I cannot live without this product. I constantly have to put something on my lips to keep them from getting super dry and I have tried countless other products over the years. Nothing compares to this amazing little tube. But the Coffee and the strawberry flavors are not really pleasant and the smell is too strong for my taste. The quality is still great but I will stick to the original from now on. Also, it took ages for my product to arrive, which was a bummer for me.</li>
            <li> Is to put it in tubes. I&#x27;ve used this stuff for ages, and I love it, but the tins can be messy. The tubes are fantastic! Bought a set for myself a few months ago, just bought two more for christmas gifts. It&#x27;s more pricey per ounce than the traditional tin of rosebud salve, but it&#x27;s so much easier to toss in a makeup kit/purse/pocket. I&#x27;d never tried the mocha rose variety and I&#x27;m in love with it. This is my absolute favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm so much! It has worked wonders for me. It stays on for a really long time, is not sticky at all, smells nice, and gives my lips a nice subtle shine. Also sometimes different lip balms will break me out around my lips but I have completely left that issue behind since finding this.  I have been using this for a little over a year now and will continue using it for as long as it is still sold.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating, the fragrance was ok. Didn&#x27;t like the mocha rose at all. The menthol rose might have been a better one to try.</li>
            <li> My daughter, sisters and I are in love with this product!  Great for lips.  Very soothing.  I especially prefer the tube over the can, which can be hard to open and close.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product comes as pictured/described. 3 tubes: strawberry, rosebud, and mocha rose, all in a gorgeous silver tin. I absolutely love these! Perfect lip gloss, in my opinion. Just the right amount of shine/gloss, not too sticky, pleasant taste/smell, and barely a hint of sheen pink color. All in perfectly convenient tubes, so no mess on fingers! I hope these are never discontinued because I will order again and again!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lip product! It makes your lips feel so moist and it looks pretty shiny, even though it doesnt feel glossy. I have been using this brand for a while and was so excited to find it on amazon! I am a huge fan and strongly recommend this to anyone! The only downside is that I sometimes feel like I have to reapply often, but the pros absolutely outweigh the cons!!!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this set recently, desperate for natural ingredients that would truly help my dry lips. I am not a fan of digging my finger into a tin, so I opted for the tube version but not without caution! I contacted the company with concerns about the chemicals in the plastic tube, especially BPA, they gave me a quick response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Hello, Nicky,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have no harmful chemicals in our tubes whatsoever and the tins are tested and are lead free as well.&lt;br /&gt;We must comply with very rigid EU regulations in order to register our products in the EU and also in Korea.  The requirements are much more stringent than those of our FDA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for asking and enjoy the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;We are going to come out with a tube for our new rose &amp; Mandarin Lip Balm and Menthol eucalyptus Balm as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take good care,&lt;br /&gt;Linda\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this product, the tube is wonderfully convenient and much larger than I thought it would be at just over 4 inches long! I feel like I&#x27;m getting an adequate amount of product for the price with this 3 tube set. As for the effectiveness of this lip balm, it has totally cured my dry lips. I used to get dry lip scabs that I would bite at and end up tearing my lips, it was terrible and painful! I had been using [[ASIN:B000C666GO Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm, 0.15 Ounce Tube]] for many years and it just wasn&#x27;t helping. Rosebud lip balm moisturizes my lips so completely, I can go hours and hours without feeling the need to reapply (but I tend to reapply sooner out of habit from using chapstick for so long, working on breaking that!). I am so happy with this product, my lips look and feel absolutely wonderful. They are plump and flush with pink color, I don&#x27;t even wear lipstick anymore because my lips look so naturally beautiful now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. IMHO the mocha is gross, but the flavor disappears very quickly so I got over it</li>
            <li> Production date is 2013.Don&#x27;t like it. Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> Although the portion is smaller, I am so glad you came out with ROSEBUD SALVE in a tube.  I keep this in my son&#x27;s back pack -- it is the only lip balm than helps heal his lips when they are peeling.  I have yet to try the strawberry and mocha.  I HAVE BEEN USING ROSEBUD SALVE FOR MANY YEARS!!  Although I LOVE the salve, it is difficult to use in the tin.  Thanks for putting it in these tubes!  I will be getting more.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and natural too, cant beat it.</li>
            <li> The rosebud scented one smells the best, but the formula is the same for all three.  It&#x27;s thick and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I  am always looking for good moisturizing balm to get me through Chicago winters.  This balm feels great and does the job.</li>
            <li> Read about this and got suckered into buying it.  Not awful but way overrated and expensive.  Stick with Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Familiar with product ...not sure I particularly like the strawberry and mocha flavors ... but product arrived in a timely manner ... great presentation ... next time I may just order the original</li>
            <li> Was excited for the tube version of this product, but it&#x27;s not the same! It&#x27;s alright. The other two scents are okay, but they aren&#x27;t as moisturizing as the original rose balm.</li>
            <li> This lip balm works great.  The tubes are very convenient.</li>
            <li> The texture is different in the tube. Used to love my tin rosebud salve but felt a little dirty about always sticking my finger in it. I thought the tube would be a cleaner option. It is not as good of a texture.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I thought it was.  It is just lie putting Vaseline.  Very greasy.  Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> !I love it! Everyone should have one of those ! This brand is my favorite ! Whether the smell or the cover are perfect!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to see this in a tube.  I have used the tins for 7 or 8 years and love the tins but you cannot leave them in the car during summer, melts and makes a big mess.  Now I have a tin in the house and a tube for travel.  The best lip balm I have ever used.  I like the original best but mocha rose and menthol/eucalyptus are great as well.  Not a fan of the strawberry.  Once you start using this stuff you will be hooked.  Haven&#x27;t had chapped lips since I started using this stuff.  Not when skiing, disc golfing or any other outdoor winter activities I engage in.  I actually use this year round but more in the colder months.</li>
            <li> Great product.  You can always depend on Rosebud products working and getting the most for your money.  Great products all the way around.</li>
            <li> I give these out as gifts. Everyone loves them! Inexpensive and a great value--I buy them for my daughter&#x27;s friends for birthdays. They all have loved them.</li>
            <li> Love this gloss set....however the rosebud salve tube leaked. The end of the tube was not sealed and when I went to apply the gloss all of the product came out of the other end. It would be nice to have another sent to make up for it!</li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is out of personal preference to the scents. The buying experience was five stars though. The mocha scent smells like most coffee scented balms and salves. The strawberry didn&#x27;t exceed my expectations but alas is still a nice sweet strawberry smelling product (just not as sickly sweet as I would prefer). The original smelled nice and floral scented. The labelling was askew on the original tube but that is not this companies fault and doesn&#x27;t really bother me anyways as the products are still nice. It is as moisturizing as a petroleum based salve can be. All in all I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I personally think this lip balm is a must have item in any girl&#x27;s purse. I love the tube even better, so I don&#x27;t have to dig my finger in the balm..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard great things about this local phenom (Woodsboro, MD-based Rosebud Perfume Co), but never tried any of their products. When I saw this cute gift set available here, I figured I would treat myself. I go through lip balms like crazy during the winter, and have tubes stashed everywhere from my desk to my car to my purse.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to try the Rosebud lip balm line! I&#x27;m not a big fan of using those little tins/pots which Rosebud tends to use, so I&#x27;m glad this alternative is available.&lt;br /&gt;Each of these works well either alone or under a lipstick (or with a lip stain, like I use). I apply before bed too, and wake up with supple lips. Of the three &amp;#34;flavors,&amp;#34; the mocha rose one is my favorite. I love the subtle color or tint, and the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is amazing. The strawberry is a close second, and the original &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is nice overall too, though I don&#x27;t exactly enjoy the perfume-y rose of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Like with many lip balms, you do have to reapply throughout the day, but with such fun &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not a chore.&lt;br /&gt;This set is complete with a silver tin, which makes gift-giving a cinch. I&#x27;m ordering a couple more to have on hand for hostess-type gifts throughout the year.</li>
            <li> So far I have only tried the mocha rose. It has a pleasant fragrance and adds a little color. I had been using vaseline but this is easier to apply in the tube.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I really do...my only complaint is that the mocha rose and strawberry versions seem to be less effective for me.  They smell better than the original Rosebud salve, but they don&#x27;t keep my lips as moisturized.  I do have to constantly reapply them, but they are the only thing that I have tried that actually works on my always dry/cracked lips.  These tubes may a bit pricier than some other products, but certainly are worth a try if you haven&#x27;t found anything else that alleviates this problem!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Keeps your lips moisturized for hours. Has a light glossy feel and is not sticky. One of the best lip balms I have ever used. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> my lips is very sensitive, it always dry and peel off.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing of this product: it make my lip more moisturizer and feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;but my lip still sensitive with that, it make my lip look darker, so in my opinion if you don&#x27;t sensitive this one is work well!</li>
            <li> And it was awesome because it comes in a reusable tin!!&lt;br /&gt;The tin is large and rond.&lt;br /&gt;All three tubes were in it. :)</li>
            <li> Works well and smells amazing. Love that it comes in tubes and not the tins. My favorite is the mocha scented one</li>
            <li> I remember growing up they only had 1 flavor and it came in a tin. How happy I was when I saw they had changed up, moved them into tubes and added different flavors. Don&#x27;t get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the tin version, but this makes it a lot easier to apply. And the price was great too!</li>
            <li> long lasting, works great at getting rid of chapped lips. nice smell, really loving the mocha rose, thought it would be my least liked one and ended up being my favorite.</li>
            <li> Delicious flavors and healthy lips.... The Mocha Rose flavor is my favorite.  I love Rosebud products, and it&#x27;s worth buying all three in this package.</li>
            <li> After all the rave reviews, of course I had to try one more product to soothe my year-round dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of the tubes is great. The art on the tubes gives a retro look and they come nestled in a very sweet, also retro, round can that can be used for lots of things. They fit nicely into my purses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to be of high quality, is thick when coming out of the tube, but softens up during application. The various flavors/tints have a pleasant, but light scent that goes on smoothly leaving a hint of color that looks natural on just about anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best attribute of this product - in this way, the Rosebud Medley does stand out. Once applied, it stays on my lips. It did not become sticky and gooey which would have in turn made it easy to smudge onto my teeth and around the mouth well after having been applied. I really didn&#x27;t have to worry about it which was a nice change of pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately as with all other products I have tried this one too needs to be re-applied just as frequently which is why the rating is not higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love these more. They are nice and I&#x27;ll keep using them by accepting that they require re-application every hour or so.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is like petroleum jelly with a nice scent. I smeared this stuff on for weeks and it didn&#x27;t soften my lips. Eventually gave up and bought something else.</li>
            <li> When these lip balms arrived in their pretty silver tin I felt I had adequately spoiled myself.  The tin is so cute that I am keeping it even after the balms are used up.  As far as quality...wow.  These work great at keeping my very dry lips moisturized.  They smell amazing.  My favorite is the mocha rose (and I&#x27;m not even really a chocolate person).  These might seem pricey but you are actually getting an incredible deal as each tube of balm has much more quantity than other balms/glosses I have tried.  The balm itself is a nice thick consistency that will keep your lips moisturized for a long time so you don&#x27;t need to apply it constantly.  Definitely 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> Would buy this again! A bit on the pricey side but with Rosebud&#x27;s reputation is well worth it. Wish local stores stocked more of Rosebud&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> I used to have a tin of the original balm, which I loved except for having to stick my finger in it.  I decided to get this three pack because it seemed like a good deal.  The additional scents, strawberry and mocha vanilla are awesome.  My only (very minor) complaint is that the tubes are kind of large, too big to keep in your pocket.  But I suppose that&#x27;s a silly thing to complain about because it&#x27;s more balm for your money!  The three of them come in a very pretty tin.</li>
            <li> I love Rosebud Salve and purchased these to keep in my purse.  The Mocha and Strawberry are definitely NOT my favorite at all.  They do not smell good to me.  Would rather they all be just the regular Salve.</li>
            <li> The plain flavor is amazing, awesome, and perfect. Aquaphor is the only other lip product that helps me when my lips are dry or chapped. I really don&#x27;t like the strawberry flavor here- to me it tastes really artificial, while the original rose one is absolutely delicate and lovely. The mocha one went in my sister in law&#x27;s Christmas stocking, so I&#x27;m not sure how that one is. I will say, though, that this balm is way better in this new tube format than in the little tub. It&#x27;s more sanitary, it doesn&#x27;t melt all over when it gets hot, and I can leave one in my purse, car, makeup bag, etc. it&#x27;s great on cuticles too. Or even to tame the occasional flyaway in my hair!</li>
            <li> I just love this item.  It is very hard to find lip therapy because I find a lot of them do not moisturize my lips but this item does and love the tin it comes in.</li>
            <li> I love rosebud salve in the regular tin, it has a nice flavor so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  Unfortunately, altho I like the lip balm, which seems to be the same product in the salve tin, I dodn&#x27;t like the coffee &amp; mocha flavors contained in this lip balm medly.  The coffe flavor,in particular, made me feel like I have &amp;#34;coffee breath.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love these!  I am a lip balm/gloss junkie and these are just amazing!  Try these and you will fall in love with Rosebud, too</li>
            <li> I love every one of these balms and was thrilled with the packaging they came in. Didn&#x27;t realize they would come in a really cute round decorative tin. This would make a very nice gift set around Christmas, felt like I received a present. :) The balms are very hydrating, and smell lovely. They have a slightly sweet taste as well. They can be a little difficult to squeeze out of the tube but I think this is a bonus because it can be too easy to push too much up for this style of tube. Very happy with my purchase, will reorder.</li>
