            <li>Awesome buy.</li>
            <li>This serum is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>has been very nice.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of this serum on my skin and it has just a hint of a very pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>has delivered good results.  </li>
            <li>Although it does feel good</li>
            <li>Trust me, tried many others!  </li>
            <li>I thought that was so nice to throw in a bonus.</li>
            <li>but it is the best that I have come up with so far for my neck.  </li>
            <li>Owner was so sweet and sent me a good luck note and a travel sized bottle.</li>
            <li>love the feel.  </li>
            <li>and they are looking better.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s light and the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>BUT WILL GIVE IT MORE TIME</li>
            <li>Love the smooth feel of this serum, firms and moisturizes, amazing texture.  </li>
            <li>Not only has this product worked on my neck and under arm, but it has surprisingly helped my son&#x27;s eczema!  </li>
            <li>good - one seemed very surprised.  </li>
            <li>Within days of using this product, I saw a huge difference in skin firmness on my chest, neck and hands.</li>
            <li>The serum itself is a white gel with a light pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>While the seller is very sweet, sending good wishes, it is nonetheless not a professional product.</li>
            <li>This product has a wonderful, clean fresh scent without being perfumy or heavy.  </li>
            <li>Is this a true miracle worker - no -</li>
            <li>Fast and friendly service!</li>
            <li>Quick shipment, noticeable results within weeks.</li>
            <li>I mean the person sending this was so amazing that I think it may work on good vibes</li>
            <li>I gave it a good long try.</li>
            <li>The odd thing is that the travel size smells great.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and will buy more, especially from this vendor.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s any change, I will be sure to come back and update!</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference in the first week.</li>
            <li>You do have to keep using it to keep results, but price point is reasonable!</li>
            <li>but I do feel that this product does give a certain level of firmness to the areas</li>
            <li>Better than more expensive products that I&#x27;ve tried (Murad&#x27;s firm), so happy with it thus far.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much result at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it faithfully and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the travel size, don&#x27;t know that I really see any difference at all, but it may be too soon to tell.</li>
            <li>The product is packaged in a smallish plastic squirt bottle, much like shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The saleswomen both assumed my neck would need moisturizing yet both commented that my neck looked really</li>
            <li>This product was good but after using it for 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve only seen a slight difference.</li>
            <li>One thing you should be aware of is that this does not appear to be a professional product.</li>
            <li>Not only does my throat area look firmer and more supple, but the rash on the back of my neck went away.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>At first I was so please because they sent me an extra travel size.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>if you use it consistently, i believe the neck area would look much younger and firmer.</li>
            <li>This is amazing to me as I am one of those women for whom very few products actually work.  </li>
            <li>The seller clearly runs a home business and the product is bottled at home with the label placed at home.</li>
            <li>If you want your skin to look supple, tight and fresh this summer, this product is for you!</li>
            <li>The most positive thing I can say about this serum is that it&#x27;s not as expensive as the others out there.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very affordable and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little longer, but it&#x27;s so worth the time.  </li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and I was worried about my neck that&#x27;s starting to sag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a thin gel.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be positive that this is what it was from, but it was the only thing I was regularly putting on my neck and upper chest area, and I definitely started breaking out....</li>
            <li>Not magic, but worth the price..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not magic, but worth the price..</li>
            <li> It does seem to moisturize well, and I wonder if others are confusing a more moisturized, less dry look with firming.</li>
            <li> In reading the other reviews I am surprised that others believe that they do.</li>
            <li> but it looks like it at least for the first hour after putting it on</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but orderedit and have been using it, though usually only once a day and primarily on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Firm Up!!</li>
            <li> Have only used Firm Up intermittently for the last two weeks, but have already noticed a difference in the lines on my chest.</li>
            <li> I have been using firm up for about 3 months now, its the only lotion I have actually seen results with.  </li>
            <li> I went back to Loral Double Lift - at least that actually firms.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a couple of weeks, but can see a slight difference already.  </li>
            <li> I saw a difference in less than a week with two applications per day.</li>
            <li> Within a few days I saw a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I have been doing exercises to firm up my arms as well as using the serum</li>
            <li> moisturizes without being greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item to firm my neck.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and within few days of use we noticed a visible difference in the neck area.</li>
            <li> The product does really firm up your skin.</li>
            <li> Sticky and doesn&#x27;t firm.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t firm anything.</li>
            <li> The lotion has an unappealing feel  when placing it on my skin and has done nothing to firm my neck, chest or upper arms</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong scent</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doing anything</li>
            <li> The regular is just too unpleasant to use.</li>
            <li> It is unpleasantly stick, and the smell is not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I have to add this serum to the growing list of neck products I&#x27;ve tried that just did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> His skin has been so bad</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was the worst smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> A friend of mine gave me a sample of this product.  Within a few days I saw a noticeable difference.  Not only did I use this on my neck and arms but also on my face.  The lines just above my lip and on my forehead are minimized.  I love the feel of this serum on my skin and it has just a hint of a very pleasant fragrance.  This has now become a staple of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a couple of weeks, but can see a slight difference already.  It tones up the upper arm and smooths it out.  Better than more expensive products that I&#x27;ve tried (Murad&#x27;s firm), so happy with it thus far.  It took away some of the crepeyness (i&#x27;m sure i spelled this wrong) and combined with upper body toning has delivered good results.  Not magic, but worth the price..</li>
            <li> Can you use it on your legs. My gf let me try it and I did see a difference on my neck</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and I was worried about my neck that&#x27;s starting to sag. It&#x27;s improved ! I will continue to use this product and will buy more, especially from this vendor. Awesome buy.</li>
            <li> Have only used Firm Up intermittently for the last two weeks, but have already noticed a difference in the lines on my chest. This is amazing to me as I am one of those women for whom very few products actually work.  Based on the results to my chest area, I plan to start using it on my face and arms.  Who knows, maybe I&#x27;ll start bathing in it!  Thanks, Firm Up!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much result at all.  I&#x27;ve used it faithfully and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference.</li>
            <li> Not only has this product worked on my neck and under arm, but it has surprisingly helped my son&#x27;s eczema!  His skin has been so bad this fall that I have tried just about anything you can smear on his skin.  This product finally helped get it under control!!  I can&#x27;t wait to give this product to my family and friends this holiday season!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now and see no signs of firming. In reading the other reviews I am surprised that others believe that they do. It does seem to moisturize well, and I wonder if others are confusing a more moisturized, less dry look with firming. One thing you should be aware of is that this does not appear to be a professional product. The seller clearly runs a home business and the product is bottled at home with the label placed at home. While the seller is very sweet, sending good wishes, it is nonetheless not a professional product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking this product.  The only reason I give it a 4-star rating is because of the scent.  It&#x27;s not a strong scent but I prefer no scent products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my imagination or the massaging but I do feel that this product does give a certain level of firmness to the areas it&#x27;s to be used on.  Granted, as with everything, it&#x27;s to be used daily and I try morning and night.  I was on a trip for 3 weeks and I took a smaller bottle of it with me and I continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel.  It&#x27;s more like a thin gel.  I like the scent and the entire experience has been very nice.  It came with a bonus of a tiny bottle to take with, phone number, and a dollar bill.  I mean the person sending this was so amazing that I think it may work on good vibes alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say, give it a try.  Nothing to lose and maybe you might like it as I do.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum for my upper arms.  I have been doing exercises to firm up my arms as well as using the serum and they are looking better.  Is it the serum or the exercise, or both.  Not sure.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this stuff works. I saw a difference in less than a week with two applications per day. I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doing anything but it looks like it at least for the first hour after putting it on</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, noticeable results within weeks. Owner was so sweet and sent me a good luck note and a travel sized bottle. Will buy again! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> The lotion has an unappealing feel  when placing it on my skin and has done nothing to firm my neck, chest or upper arms</li>
            <li> This product has a wonderful, clean fresh scent without being perfumy or heavy.  I use it on my neck once or twice daily and it absorbs into the skin without leaving a film yet moisturizes without being greasy or heavy.  It&#x27;s also very affordable and goes a long way.  I will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li> At first I was so please because they sent me an extra travel size. I thought that was so nice to throw in a bonus. Then I put the lotion on. It was the worst smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The odd thing is that the travel size smells great. So, am I getting two different products? I&#x27;ve used the travel size, don&#x27;t know that I really see any difference at all, but it may be too soon to tell. The regular is just too unpleasant to use. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I have to add this serum to the growing list of neck products I&#x27;ve tried that just did not work for me.  The product is packaged in a smallish plastic squirt bottle, much like shampoo.  The serum itself is a white gel with a light pleasant smell.  I will keep using it until it&#x27;s gone, but I can tell you that there is no difference in the skin on my neck since I began using it about 3 weeks ago.  The most positive thing I can say about this serum is that it&#x27;s not as expensive as the others out there.  If there&#x27;s any change, I will be sure to come back and update!</li>
            <li> I have been using firm up for about 3 months now, its the only lotion I have actually seen results with.  Trust me, tried many others!  Will continue with this product, just hope she keeps making it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to firm my neck.  Although it does feel good&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the neck area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 6 months and I can see a difference.  You have to apply twice daily faithfully.  It&#x27;s not a permanent fix but there is definite improvement in my neck and arms. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t working for me on my arms</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but orderedit and have been using it, though usually only once a day and primarily on my neck.  At a running expo and in the hotels at Las Vegas, they were selling all sorts of lotions.  The saleswomen both assumed my neck would need moisturizing yet both commented that my neck looked really good - one seemed very surprised.  I can say that I like it and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This does not help with girming at all.  My skin is softer that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Is this a true miracle worker - no - but it is the best that I have come up with so far for my neck.  Also, I did purchase a 2nd bottle when I ran out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and within few days of use we noticed a visible difference in the neck area. This has motivated me to try it myself.</li>
            <li> WOW!  Since I turned 40, changes in my skin elasticity have become noticable.  Within days of using this product, I saw a huge difference in skin firmness on my chest, neck and hands. It&#x27;s a serum so it&#x27;s light and the smell is amazing.  If you want your skin to look supple, tight and fresh this summer, this product is for you!</li>
            <li> This serum is wonderful! I have been using it on my neck and face. Noticed a difference in the first week. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> did not notice any firming results but have not used it regularly.</li>
            <li> Literally ended up throwing this away toward the end of the bottle.  I don&#x27;t think it did a darn thing.  In fact, I think it started giving me a rash on my neck??  I couldn&#x27;t be positive that this is what it was from, but it was the only thing I was regularly putting on my neck and upper chest area, and I definitely started breaking out....I don&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
            <li> This product was good but after using it for 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve only seen a slight difference. If the situation changes I&#x27;ll update my rating.</li>
            <li> I started using this product two weeks ago and have noticed a difference in my eyes &amp; especially my neck.  I&#x27;m using the serum on my arms and looking forward to the results.  Takes a little longer, but it&#x27;s so worth the time.  This is a must try if you&#x27;re over 40.</li>
            <li> They sent me a sample and a dollar. The product does really firm up your skin. if you use it consistently, i believe the neck area would look much younger and firmer.</li>
            <li> NO BIG CHANGE  BUT WILL GIVE IT MORE TIME</li>
            <li> Sticky and doesn&#x27;t firm.</li>
            <li> Love the smooth feel of this serum, firms and moisturizes, amazing texture.  I&#x27;ve been using now for a couple of months and will definitely keep buying, don&#x27;t hesitate trying this one out.</li>
            <li> Great product! Been using for a year now and noticed a difference. You do have to keep using it to keep results, but price point is reasonable! Fast and friendly service!</li>
            <li> This is great. Not only does my throat area look firmer and more supple, but the rash on the back of my neck went away. Love it!!</li>
            <li> A waste of money. I gave it a good long try. It didn&#x27;t firm anything. I used it around my chin, hoping for results. It is unpleasantly stick, and the smell is not good. I went back to Loral Double Lift - at least that actually firms.</li>
