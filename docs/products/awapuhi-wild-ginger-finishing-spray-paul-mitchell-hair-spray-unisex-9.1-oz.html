            <li>Quite honestly my Moroccan Oil Hairspray smells a lot better.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best hair spray I have found.  </li>
            <li>This spray is perfect for my fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>This spray smells SO good and makes your hair feel great, it is not heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li>sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am honestly pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I love all the products in the Awapuhi line and use them faithfully.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks better and better with these products.  </li>
            <li>Maybe you will love it..............</li>
            <li>this one is way better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is just ok.</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am not going to be able to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love the awapuhi  line of Paul Mitchell, shampoo and conditioner also.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I have to say, I resent having to type as many words as are requied</li>
            <li>After reading a lot of reviews on different hairsprays, this one was highly recommended for great hold and a supposedly wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>My hair is so fine I had given up and resorted to permanent wave solutions for many many years.</li>
            <li>It is the most odorless spray I have used to date, which is a huge bonus for me.</li>
            <li>Honestly, my hair never looked so good in my whole life, and I know I am not imagining it because several people have commented on how nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and needs body, this spray gives the needed boost.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a fine mist spray to hold some fine textured hair skip this one..</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t curl well, but this spray helps me keep the curl all day.  </li>
            <li>, that is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>My primary reservation is the price.</li>
            <li>I consider the hold light.  </li>
            <li>Then I lightly spray a layer of this product and shape the hair.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser told me about it originally.</li>
            <li>The hold is good, although not as flexible a hold as I generally prefer.</li>
            <li>Wish it were in an earth friendly pump tho.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>have to hold it out at a full arm&#x27;s length to use this product...</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the money and even if it was free, I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>my Tresemme Keratin conditioner, and diffuse, and my hair is a very pretty curly triangle head.</li>
            <li>I thought I found my new favorite hair spray in the Lanza line with their keratin oil hair spray</li>
            <li>Absolutely Love this Wild Awapuhi  Ginger Keratin Conditioner!</li>
            <li>The curls become more defined and light, and the shape of the hair becomes more proportionate and less triangular.</li>
            <li>Just a fine spray all over and a little more to hold more.  </li>
            <li>It does hold hair all day &amp; if you do use too much just lightly work your fingers through your hair &amp; that will loosen it up without taking away the hold.</li>
            <li>I spray lightly and it holds my hair for the whole day.</li>
            <li>but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a hairspray with good hold that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet and crispy, and I believe I have found it in this product.  </li>
            <li>It holds great, not to stiff, and holds up in rain.  </li>
            <li>Helps it stay straight and full looking.</li>
            <li>the smell is wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out like other sprays.</li>
            <li>works great really keeps hair in place not to stiff like some sprays, i like to use it with the mouse.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much and it is easier to get a comb&lt;br /&gt;through</li>
            <li>A little bit of this spray goes a long way in holding your hair; it smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li>My first impression was that I didn&#x27;t like the smell and the force of the spray would knock me over.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what you want a hair spray to do.  </li>
            <li>The smell might bother you when first sprayed but disappears once sprayed  on hair.</li>
            <li>The title pretty much sums Paul Mitchell&#x27;s hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Agadir for the past 2 years and with a huge hair style change ((drastically shorter)) needed something with a better hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This spray works exceptionally well for me (holds and generally maintains the style) when the weather is good, cold or windy.</li>
            <li>This one really works.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>However, it does not hold very well for me when it&#x27;s very humid or raining.</li>
            <li>This hairspray is nothing unusual.</li>
            <li>I have very curly unmanageable hair</li>
            <li>Adds a little volume on top and holds straight ends in place on humid days so hair doesn&#x27;t curl up.  </li>
            <li>Not stiff or sticky, but gives my hair done grip so it will behave!!</li>
            <li>I also use it when I want my hair to remain in a particular style.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a nice texture to my hair and is hard to comb out.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be a great hairspray, however, I am not happy with the smell!</li>
            <li>Nice finishing spray, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down when reapplying the next day.  </li>
            <li>I bought this spray because I have fine straight hair that easily goes flat and loses any curl I&#x27;ve obtained from using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a powerful spray though so hold a little further out to try to get an overall hold.</li>
            <li>do like the smell, and being very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>Non-sticky and very natural hold.</li>
            <li>I tried this product over a weekend of outdoor events including a Saturday wedding and a Sunday oyster roast and WOW!</li>
            <li>There are MANY other brands that hold and smell much better than this one at less than half the price.  </li>
            <li>I had read about this Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Finishing Spray in a magazine article reviewing products for hair and hair</li>
            <li>Hopefully Paul Mitchell will continue to produce Awapuhi Wild Ginger Finishing</li>
            <li>It is non-sticky and hold hair softly but well.</li>
            <li>It holds the hair with a natural look and feel.</li>
            <li>I have colored hair and wear it in a natural curly bob.  </li>
            <li>Stays soft and in place.</li>
            <li>It looks incredibly natural and no one would ever say I spray my hair.</li>
            <li>Had my hair not broken off last April, 2012, I would still be applying perms every 4 months.</li>
            <li>It does not flake, nor does it itch my head as the old hairsprays used to do.</li>
            <li>Fantastic hold and not too stiff.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, fine hair that prefers to go limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that I let pretty much dictate what it wants to do...</li>
            <li>I usually just buy a cheap hairspray from the store, but now I will never go back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;from a 70 year old white haired wonder!</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, be aware this is an extremely stiff spray even for a finishing spray.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely could NOT deal with helmut-head (i.e. Aquanet days), and I did not want the frustration of styling my hair, only to have the style fall out within 2 hours or less.</li>
            <li>This spray is VERY lightweight, and a little holds my hair all day.  </li>

            <li> Cant spray too much though or hair will be too stiff.</li>
            <li> I flat iron then spray to lift and hold.</li>
            <li> All in all a good product just disappointed that it doesnt have the scent of the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> I like it because it holds my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t look like it is plastered down with hair spray; it looks natural.  </li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, but I do not use it every day.  </li>
            <li> and if you use the spray in short spurts, it&#x27;s terrific for an all day hold without a stiff look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Leave too much residue (have to use it wisely so as not to get build-up)&lt;br /&gt;-Price ($20 for hairspray is kinda nuts to me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also need to use less of this than a regular hair spray.</li>
            <li> and every other spray bottle I have owned still suffers from congesting itself and becoming unsprayable after a while, though.</li>
            <li> I have used other Paul Mitchell products, but always a low-priced hair spray.</li>
            <li> My sense of smell is sharp.  </li>
            <li> my lifeless, softer-than-a-baby&#x27;s hair due to severe damage.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that wants to frizz and curl a little and this \\&quot;finishing spray\\</li>
            <li> Ive tried Dry Bar The Sheriff firm hair spray &amp;</li>
            <li> Also, if you hold it further away from your hair, the pressure isn&#x27;t as hard.  </li>
            <li> It is a little drying but that may be because I put it on before</li>
            <li> It is definitely NOT worth the money!</li>
            <li> Not sure how other users found this one &amp;#34;smells wonderful&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I know it is not cheap</li>
            <li> I have been using this finishing spray for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel and look stiff.  </li>
            <li> It is not a spray that will stiffly hold your hair in place, it is a lighter finishing spray but does the just what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> It smells like plain hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair stiff and helmet like.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned that the pressure of the spray is too hard, but I disagree... Just don&#x27;t press the button as hard and you can get a softer spray.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to fix it -- I rinse the nozzle off every time I use it at the moment.</li>
            <li> , it is a bit hard to comb out, but that is because it holds you hair in place</li>
            <li> and I have very thick hair which is hard to tame.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Addicted to hairspray since the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> it works and unless a product is horrible or damaging I&#x27;m going to use it to the last drop.  </li>
            <li> It certainly is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have tried alot of hairsprays in my lifetime, and they were either too starchy or smelled bad.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> but the pressure is insane...</li>

            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair that prefers to go limp and lifeless. This works so much better than drugstore brands! Hold curl and shape all day! Use it to tease my roots, too. Not stiff or sticky, but gives my hair done grip so it will behave!!</li>
            <li> My first impression was that I didn&#x27;t like the smell and the force of the spray would knock me over. Wrong. The smell doesn&#x27;t last very long and if you use the spray in short spurts, it&#x27;s terrific for an all day hold without a stiff look. I&#x27;ve tried them all from chain pharmacies and big box stores, to fancy department store counters. This one really works. So, give it a try.....I know it is not cheap but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li> This spray has holding power.  Later in the day if you recomb you hair, the style remains.  It is a little drying but that may be because I put it on before and after I use the curling iron.</li>
            <li> good product, arrived on schedule</li>
            <li> I had read about this Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Finishing Spray in a magazine article reviewing products for hair and hair sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am honestly pleased with the product. I have used other Paul Mitchell products, but always a low-priced hair spray. I decided to try this product and&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the smell, and being very sensitive to smells, that is a huge plus for me. You don&#x27;t need very much and it is easier to get a comb&lt;br /&gt;through it once it&#x27;s on. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever!!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that wants to frizz and curl a little and this \\&quot;finishing spray\\&quot; stops it in it&#x27;s tracks. Helps it stay straight and full looking. My hairdresser told me about it originally. I also need to use less of this than a regular hair spray.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that I let pretty much dictate what it wants to do... Whenever I do try and style by curling - it holds for maybe 10 minutes then falls out. I tried this product over a weekend of outdoor events including a Saturday wedding and a Sunday oyster roast and WOW! I was worried it&#x27;d make my blonde hair look straw-like... Not only did it hold, my hair actually looked luxurious! LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I love all the products in the Awapuhi line and use them faithfully.  My hair looks better and better with these products.  HOWEVER, be aware this is an extremely stiff spray even for a finishing spray.  I will use the can I have purchased, but will not buy this again.  It leaves me with helmet head even if I try to use only a tiny bit.  Maybe you will love it..............just a head&#x27;s up.</li>
            <li> Ive tried Dry Bar The Sheriff firm hair spray &amp; this one is way better.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray on vacation at hotel salon - the BEST hairspray I have ever used! The Awapuhi gives lift and prevents &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; for days. I flat iron then spray to lift and hold. It keeps hair lifted - next day you can spray again. Non-sticky and very natural hold. I tell everyone! No local supply anywhere in Scottsdale/Phoenix.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does exactly what you want a hair spray to do.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews on different hairsprays, this one was highly recommended for great hold and a supposedly wonderful scent. The hold is good, although not as flexible a hold as I generally prefer. The smell is just ok. Nothing to write home about. Quite honestly my Moroccan Oil Hairspray smells a lot better. Probably won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this Wild Awapuhi  Ginger Keratin Conditioner!</li>
            <li> My favorite spray (I have used a LOT of hair sprays!). It is the most odorless spray I have used to date, which is a huge bonus for me. I guess it is not the strongest hold to spray ratio, though, so that might be a downside for some of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This and every other spray bottle I have owned still suffers from congesting itself and becoming unsprayable after a while, though. I&#x27;m not sure how to fix it -- I rinse the nozzle off every time I use it at the moment.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best hair spray I have found.  My hair is fine and needs body, this spray gives the needed boost.  Thank you Good Housekeeping for your recommendation.  Hopefully Paul Mitchell will continue to produce Awapuhi Wild Ginger Finishing Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thank you Amazon  for your amazingness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from a 70 year old white haired wonder!</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray.  It holds great, not to stiff, and holds up in rain.  It doesn&#x27;t take much.  Just a fine spray all over and a little more to hold more.  Smell is good and not medicinal  or over powering.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product. It is non-sticky and hold hair softly but well.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray because I have fine straight hair that easily goes flat and loses any curl I&#x27;ve obtained from using a curling iron.  This spray works exceptionally well for me (holds and generally maintains the style) when the weather is good, cold or windy. However, it does not hold very well for me when it&#x27;s very humid or raining. I&#x27;ve been using this product about a month now.</li>
            <li> I thought I found my new favorite hair spray in the Lanza line with their keratin oil hair spray but I tried this on a whim and I have to say this is it.  My heart is set on Paul Mitchell once again.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d actually buy hairspray but after reading about the product I wanted to give it a try versus gel and I&#x27;m glad I did. Great product</li>
            <li> All about the smell. If you like the smell you will like the product.</li>
            <li> Good hairspray. Wish it were in an earth friendly pump tho. This is the only thing that would encourage me to change product.</li>
            <li> It holds hair well even in damp weather. Doesn&#x27;t build up on  hair. The smell might bother you when first sprayed but disappears once sprayed  on hair. That didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> This does not seem to have any smell almost unscented but I do like the hold. Cant spray too much though or hair will be too stiff. It does hold hair all day &amp; if you do use too much just lightly work your fingers through your hair &amp; that will loosen it up without taking away the hold. I like that it seems flexible &amp; brushable. No helmet head. All in all a good product just disappointed that it doesnt have the scent of the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Agadir for the past 2 years and with a huge hair style change ((drastically shorter)) needed something with a better hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Strong Hold&lt;br /&gt;-Smells fabulous&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Leave too much residue (have to use it wisely so as not to get build-up)&lt;br /&gt;-Price ($20 for hairspray is kinda nuts to me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works and unless a product is horrible or damaging I&#x27;m going to use it to the last drop.  I&#x27;m at the end of this spray and would probably order it again. My primary reservation is the price.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this at a resort in Turks &amp; Caicos and loved it.  So I bought this and the shampoo.  I&#x27;ve used both ever since.</li>
            <li> It holds the hair with a natural look and feel. I also like the secent. I have purchased it before and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is nothing unusual. It is definitely NOT worth the money! I would not purchase this hair product again.</li>
            <li> I loooovvveeee this spray.. the smell is wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out like other sprays. I have colored hair and wear it in a natural curly bob.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This spray is perfect for my fine, straight hair.  Adds a little volume on top and holds straight ends in place on humid days so hair doesn&#x27;t curl up.  Buy this!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this hairspray.  It makes my hair feel and look stiff.  I am not going to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this finishing spray for a few years.  I purchase it from my hair dresser.  My hair tends to frizz up when it is humid and or rainy.  A bit of this spray and my hair holds in place with reduced  or no frizz on the places where I have sprayed it..  I also use it when I want my hair to remain in a particular style.  It is not a spray that will stiffly hold your hair in place, it is a lighter finishing spray but does the just what I want it to do. You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot to reduce frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is a bit hard to comb out, but that is because it holds you hair in place relative well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, but I do not use it every day.  I like it because it holds my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t look like it is plastered down with hair spray; it looks natural.  It is the best finishing spray I have found that meets my needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now and I have very thick hair which is hard to tame.  A little bit of this spray goes a long way in holding your hair; it smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> Great smell! Fantastic hold and not too stiff. Kind of a powerful spray though so hold a little further out to try to get an overall hold.</li>
            <li> Addicted to hairspray since the 80&#x27;s.  Have always sought out a hairspray with great hold AND pleasant smell.  This is not the one!  My sense of smell is sharp.  Not sure how other users found this one &amp;#34;smells wonderful&amp;#34;.  It smells like plain hairspray.  I consider the hold light.  It certainly is expensive.  There are MANY other brands that hold and smell much better than this one at less than half the price.  Sorry I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Great product to manage my curly hair</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Leaves my hair nice and soft.  Does not make my hair feel like its plastered to my head.  Stays soft and in place.</li>
            <li> Smells good, holds ok... but the pressure is insane...&lt;br /&gt;I have to hold it out at a full arm&#x27;s length to use this product... If you&#x27;re looking for a fine mist spray to hold some fine textured hair skip this one..</li>
            <li> Made my hair stiff and helmet like.  After one use, have thrown the hairspray away and will never purchase again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a hairspray with good hold that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet and crispy, and I believe I have found it in this product.  I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t curl well, but this spray helps me keep the curl all day.  It is also ideal for when I put my hair up.  Other reviewers mentioned that the pressure of the spray is too hard, but I disagree... Just don&#x27;t press the button as hard and you can get a softer spray.  Also, if you hold it further away from your hair, the pressure isn&#x27;t as hard.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. As it says, it isn&#x27;t a hairspray but a finishing spray. I have very curly unmanageable hair and I couldn&#x27;t do without this spray. I put in my Oleo relax, my Tresemme Keratin conditioner, and diffuse, and my hair is a very pretty curly triangle head. Then I lightly spray a layer of this product and shape the hair. The curls become more defined and light, and the shape of the hair becomes more proportionate and less triangular. One bottle lasts my enormous head of hair over six months. It&#x27;s an unbeatable necessity in my bathroom. It looks incredibly natural and no one would ever say I spray my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so fine I had given up and resorted to permanent wave solutions for many many years. Had my hair not broken off last April, 2012, I would still be applying perms every 4 months. But I had to grow out my lifeless, softer-than-a-baby&#x27;s hair due to severe damage. When I reached a point where it had grown and was its old soft fly-away self, I looked online for products that may have \\&quot;caught up\\&quot; in the last few years.  I knew I could not have any products that were \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; on my hair, as those products simply \\&quot;kill\\&quot; any hairstyle I am trying for. I am so glad I found this hairspray. I absolutely could NOT deal with helmut-head (i.e. Aquanet days), and I did not want the frustration of styling my hair, only to have the style fall out within 2 hours or less. This spray is VERY lightweight, and a little holds my hair all day.  Truly, I am stunned. It does not flake, nor does it itch my head as the old hairsprays used to do. Wish I had found it years ago. Honestly, my hair never looked so good in my whole life, and I know I am not imagining it because several people have commented on how nice my hair looks. Hope you have the same results.</li>
            <li> This hair spray was introduced to me by my hair stylist in florida. When I returned home I could not find it but then I found it online and was very happy.</li>
            <li> I like this hair spray because it does a very good job of holding and does not contain Propylene Glycol.</li>
            <li> Nice finishing spray, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down when reapplying the next day.  Love Paul Mitchell products!  Arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this hairspray at all.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a nice texture to my hair and is hard to comb out.  It isn&#x27;t worth the money and even if it was free, I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This spray smells SO good and makes your hair feel great, it is not heavy on your hair. I love the awapuhi  line of Paul Mitchell, shampoo and conditioner also.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a great hairspray, however, I am not happy with the smell!</li>
            <li> works great really keeps hair in place not to stiff like some sprays, i like to use it with the mouse.</li>
            <li> The title pretty much sums Paul Mitchell&#x27;s hairspray.  I have tried alot of hairsprays in my lifetime, and they were either too starchy or smelled bad.  This one is neither.  Granted if you spray alot in your hair it will be starchy but that&#x27;s a no brainer.  I spray lightly and it holds my hair for the whole day.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. I usually just buy a cheap hairspray from the store, but now I will never go back. I have never had a hairspray that held my curls so well!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair sticky.  That&#x27;s all I have to say, I resent having to type as many words as are requied</li>
            <li> PLEASE keep making this!</li>
