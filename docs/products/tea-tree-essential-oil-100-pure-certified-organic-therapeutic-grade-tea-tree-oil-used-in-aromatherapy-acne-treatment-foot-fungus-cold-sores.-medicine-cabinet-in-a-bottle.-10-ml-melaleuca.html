            <li>I will say this stuff smells right</li>
            <li>I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; for the price, but was really happy that it was comparable to the regular one I get at my local store.  </li>
            <li>Usually allergies and colds linger for weeks with me, but this worked amazingly!  </li>

            <li>very potent!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>

            <li>I received this essential oil at a reduced rate for my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;For about a month I have been purchasing and studying essential oils.  </li>

            <li>It is a decent quality oil from what I can see.</li>
            <li>(although I haven&#x27;t used it for long yet), but the dispenser leaks out much too quickly</li>

            <li> Well, long story short, 1 day later, my stuffy/runny nose, sore throat and sneezing was totally gone!  </li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Smaller bottle then expected but still as advertised.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust tea tree from another country/continent where it was imported to and does not naturally grow.</li>
            <li> However, purchasing this regularly from a health food store, it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> Just few drops diluted in water are enough to scent and work as disinfectant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t as steonh as other tea tree.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Wellnesscent brand did not help with my issue like the other brand did.  </li>
            <li> So, I boiled a big bowl of water, added about 5 drops of the oil, covered my head with a towel (to hold the steam under) and slowly inhaled (and exhaled) for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> During my research I found that if you inhale steaming water with a few drops of the oil, it can kill viruses/relieve allergies.  </li>
            <li> and this leads to waste of oil.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for my hair, especially after a cold winter when my scalp is dried out</li>
            <li> I appreciate how the company works hard for feedback</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed if this was just false advertising.</li>
            <li> I am treating a serious problem that just cropped up in my neck for pain and swelling.  </li>
            <li> This tells me it was false advertising.</li>
            <li> However, when the tea tree oil arrived, I happened to have serious allergies or a cold going on.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I originally bought this oil, because I have some mold growing in my bathroom and I had read that tea tree oil can kill it.  Well, the mold looks the same.  However, when the tea tree oil arrived, I happened to have serious allergies or a cold going on.  During my research I found that if you inhale steaming water with a few drops of the oil, it can kill viruses/relieve allergies.  So, I boiled a big bowl of water, added about 5 drops of the oil, covered my head with a towel (to hold the steam under) and slowly inhaled (and exhaled) for 10 minutes.  Well, long story short, 1 day later, my stuffy/runny nose, sore throat and sneezing was totally gone!  Usually allergies and colds linger for weeks with me, but this worked amazingly!  I was shocked!  I definitely recommend this if you want to feel better naturally and quickly.</li>
            <li> Great service! I love the free brochure!</li>
            <li> Well I ordered this about a month ago. It wasn&#x27;t until after I opened the oil, that I noticed it didn&#x27;t come with the booklet like the description says.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Awesome product... very potent!&lt;br /&gt;Love using this all over... from cleaning to hair care!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell so I used it as a cleansing spray for my yoga mats and hammocks :)</li>
            <li> Great stuff to have on hand, High quality and great price! I highly recommend trying this if you use this in your household!</li>
            <li> Great item, just like description, what i want.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Strong concentration.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! It really shrunk the pores on my face ( can hardly see them) and I have used it for many other things. Love it</li>
            <li> I love WellnessScent tea tree oil!! Is a great buy and it&#x27;s a great quality product. I always try to find the best products in the market and this is one of them.

            <li> I really love tee tree oilBut I never received the e book that came with it</li>
            <li> USDA certified Tea Tree Oil</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, cannot wait to use.</li>
            <li> High quality oil! Smells wonderful and cleared up a small patch of acne in 48 hours. Arrived quickly and just what I wanted. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Initially I applied the oil to a tag on my forehead, then noticed I had a drop or two on the counter and soaked it into a q tip and rubbed it on a bunion.  I rubbed some Gold Bond lotion in with that and found that the pain was greatly reduced.  Today I mixed a drop with hydrocortisone and rubbed it into a shoulder that I had rotator cuff surgery on 13 years ago (surgery not recommended) with lingering pain all of the years.  This too felt very good, so I will continue trying it.  Hopefully that nagging flap will fall off and I will discover what it will do for the various pains of aging!  Update, applied to a knee with a surgically damaged nerve and  it really helps.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it&#x27;s 100% organic tea tree oil, which is great! I like the cute little bottle and that it doesn&#x27;t allow the product to spill out easily since tea tree oil is a bit expensive. I appreciate how the company works hard for feedback and so far I have no complaints. I use this oil for my hair, especially after a cold winter when my scalp is dried out and it&#x27;s great. I definitely would recommend this company to others who are looking for not only a good product but good custome service as well!</li>
            <li> It works for everything which means it is truly 100%</li>
            <li> Smells great. Was packed well. got here in a timely manner. It seems to work really well in my diffuser! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the wonderful and pure tea tree oil! Love it. Great packaging ⭐️</li>
            <li> Loving It ..  using it on my acne problem.  smooth out bump and remove redness after two days.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil is a staple in my beauty/medicine cabinet.  It has a number of uses, as an antiseptic, blemish treatment, adding to massage lotion/oil, adding to my kids&#x27; hair detangler spray as a lice preventive, etc.  However, purchasing this regularly from a health food store, it is a little pricey and I thought to try this product out off of Amazon.  I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; for the price, but was really happy that it was comparable to the regular one I get at my local store.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The oil itself seems to be great (although I haven&#x27;t used it for long yet), but the dispenser leaks out much too quickly and this leads to waste of oil.</li>
            <li> Great for so many things.</li>
            <li> It is a decent quality oil from what I can see. The scent isn&#x27;t as steonh as other tea tree. Maybe that&#x27;s good or.Maybe it&#x27;s not as pure. Used it to kill some mold growth and also to help with a cut. Please be sure to dilute it before using.</li>
            <li> Really sucked did not help my acne scars at all!! Plus smell is so strong burned my eyes so much</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This essential oil is amazing. Top quality! I just started using it so I&#x27;ll have to update later on how it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this oil. I am new to essential oils, but am amazed at how useful this one is. The company provides fabulous information in the e-book form and the customer service is FABULOUS. I highly recommend to anyone searching for a way to enjoy essential oils.</li>
            <li> I will say this stuff smells right but I used it for weeks under doctors care. Nothing! Didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil. Just few drops diluted in water are enough to scent and work as disinfectant</li>
            <li> NO USDA Organic or QAI Organic label on bottle, even though it shows it on the pictures in Amazon. This tells me it was false advertising. No wonder the oil is so cheap. Ugh. I also emailed them for further info on June 22nd and it is now July 6th. They have not responded.</li>
            <li> I just received this like 4 hours ago and washed my face then sprayed some of this on from a spray bottle and automatically it toned  my skin an Strunk my pores it just gives your face that refreshing feeling</li>
            <li> Great product. Prompt delivery. Smaller than I expected but hopefully the quality will make up for it.</li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I greatly appreciate the free e-book on the history of and uses for tea tree oil.  I have greatly enjoyed using this oil both in my laundry, perfect to add to a second rinse if you&#x27;ve left a load in the washer longer than intended, and also mixing it with lavender oil into coconut oil as a carrier to use on my skin at night. Would recommend this purchase to others interested in quality tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Well like the product but I thought it was a bigger size for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in the shower gels and salves I&#x27;ve been making for myself at home.  A little goes a long way!  Since I&#x27;ve been making my own shower gel, my skin has improved tremendously!!</li>
            <li> This is my first order from your company but I love this oil. Thank you,</li>
            <li> Best Tea Tree Ive tried yet!!</li>
            <li> good company.  Smaller bottle then expected but still as advertised.</li>
            <li> Unsure if this is actually organic.  The USDA Organic label is shown on the picture on in the listing, but does not appear on the bottle anywhere.  Pretty disappointed if this was just false advertising.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the free ebook!</li>
            <li> Very powerful, true to scent</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is a must have in my house.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I am just starting to experiment with essential oils and this is the first one I have bought. It&#x27;s only been a few days and it&#x27;s already started to clear up my acne on my face. I have bought so many chemical filled products trying to get rid of my acne, this product is turning out to be my life saver.</li>
            <li> I received this essential oil at a reduced rate for my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;For about a month I have been purchasing and studying essential oils.  There is a lot to learn.  I have found that they work and they do what my research has revealed to me.  I am treating a serious problem that just cropped up in my neck for pain and swelling.  And the oils have given me great relief in both areas.&lt;br /&gt;This brand of essential Tea Tree Oil is very concentrated and works with just a drop.  I use it in my homemade hair products and doggy shampoo.  I have found that it works as a natural insect repellant also.  I love the smell of it.  But if you want to you can dilute it with carrier oil or water to calm the strength of the aroma of the oil down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;WellnesScent is an excellant essential oil provider.</li>
            <li> It works great, and I have used it to treat to nail fugue as well as adding it to my foot soak. I love the smell and I can see a change. It&#x27;s been 10 days, and I will continue to use it. Will be order another bottle as well as some of their oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tea Tree oil for years and years.  It&#x27;s absolutely amazing stuff.  This organic tea tree oil from WellnessScent is at the top of my list now however because it&#x27;s just so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s extremely potent and made from 100% organic stuff, which I really like. The price is very reasonable too, and it works really well.  As you might guess I&#x27;m highly satisfied and happy and recommend this tea tree oil very highly.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace another brand of tea tree oil I had that ran out.  Wellnesscent brand did not help with my issue like the other brand did.  I have since ordered from a different company to replace this one.  Tea tree is indigenous to Australia but Wellnesscent gets its tea tree from South Africa.  I don&#x27;t trust tea tree from another country/continent where it was imported to and does not naturally grow.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working good pleased with product.</li>
