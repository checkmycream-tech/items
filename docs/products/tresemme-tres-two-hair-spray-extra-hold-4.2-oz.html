    <ol>
            <li>Perfect size for travel!</li>
            <li>this hairspray is awesome.</li>
            <li>Best hair spray to use!</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>It allows for a good amount of hold and yet still looks touchable.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and the seller was nice.</li>
            <li>Handy.</li>
            <li>Good hair spray, strong hold, matte finish.</li>
            <li>Tresemme is one of the better hair sprays that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>There is no nasty smell, either, like some hair sprays have.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Better hairspray than plenty others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Easy for her to handle.</li>
            <li>My fault for not reading the fine print</li>
            <li>If more hold is needed for a particular look this hairspray is easily build able.</li>
            <li>having it available online is a help.</li>
            <li>I find it to be a wonderful multi use product, (use on fine hairs around the hairline, use on a brush to tame eye brows, or all over for style hold) at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>Tried and true.</li>
            <li>Oh well, will still use the product, just wished I&#x27;d ordered the full size cans.</li>
            <li>Good price and nice small size.</li>
            <li>This is not my first choice; I prefer TRESemme TRES TWO-SPRAY ultra fine mist, which is what I thought I was ordering.  </li>
            <li>Big fan and a nice deal.</li>
            <li>WHAT I EXPECTED - GOOD BRAND</li>
            <li>aerosol is just right for her.  </li>
            <li>It packs great for a small trips.</li>
            <li>yes, little big but perfect.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars is because I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Its exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find my preference in the smaller size.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite hairspray for a very very long time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m less than thrilled to figure that out when it arrived</li>
            <li>I really like that this hairspray has such a fine mist.</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>A very convenient size.  </li>
            <li>Holds but very touchable, doesn&#x27;t look or feel like hairspray</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t realize I was buying the smaller cans instead of the full size.</li>
            <li>Either way, the spray is decent but the price is too steep (for an Amazon item) for just one travel sized spray.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray but didn&#x27;t realize theses were smaller cans than I expected.</li>
            <li>I was excited thinking I was paying a few pennies less plus getting it shipped for free as an add on item.  </li>
            <li>It holds my hair in place and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>but it was fixed soon</li>
            <li>It has a gold stripe, not green.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the strength for my thick hair!</li>
            <li>However, I am not a good judge in knowing how many ounces something would be or how big a 4oz bottle of something would be,  </li>
            <li>therefore I do use Amazon quite frequently for personal item type products.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is just as good and MUCH less expensive.</li>
            <li>Obviously I don&#x27;t know much about hairspray pricing, because the day after we received them I saw the identical item in our local Target for $1.71 per can less.  </li>

            <li> My wife is semi-invalid, and has a hard time handling the large hairspray cans.  </li>
            <li> But the little travel size doesn&#x27;t even last a week.  </li>
            <li> The size was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I guess I was in a hurry when I ordered this though, and didn&#x27;t realize these are not full size bottles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and for some reason the spray in this size can and the 1.5 oz is finer than the spray in the 11oz</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff and sticky with that unnatural shiny look.  </li>
            <li> It does need to be reapplied during the day, but that is a small trade off.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why the description says &amp;#34;two</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small this bottle of hair spray is.</li>

            <li> You won&#x27; t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive for a travel size!!</li>

            <li> Tresemme is one of the better hair sprays that I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff and sticky with that unnatural shiny look.  It works really well.  It does need to be reapplied during the day, but that is a small trade off.  There is no nasty smell, either, like some hair sprays have.  It holds my hair in place and looks natural.  I really like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Spray provides a &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; hold on hairstyles.  This spray doesn&#x27;t get sticky, and won&#x27;t make your hair look shellacked.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the description says &amp;#34;two Extra hold Hair Spray&amp;#34; but only received one. Maybe I&#x27;m interpreting that incorrectly or its false advertisement. Either way, the spray is decent but the price is too steep (for an Amazon item) for just one travel sized spray.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for travel!</li>
            <li> Bought 3 of these for my wife for when we travel.  Obviously I don&#x27;t know much about hairspray pricing, because the day after we received them I saw the identical item in our local Target for $1.71 per can less.  And it was not even on sale.  Amazon will not take these back, so buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Tried and true. I have used the product before, but, wanted a packable size.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars is because I love this product.  However, I am not a good judge in knowing how many ounces something would be or how big a 4oz bottle of something would be,  I am also handicapped and have problems going in and out of stores for different purchases therefore I do use Amazon quite frequently for personal item type products.  Because I have always purchased this hairspray in Walgreens and Walmart for around the price of $3, I found this can here on Amazon and thought I had found another &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34;.  I was excited thinking I was paying a few pennies less plus getting it shipped for free as an add on item.  Upon it&#x27;s arrival, I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I was.  The can is not much bigger than a travel size can.  I know it&#x27;s my fault which is why I&#x27;m not returning it.  I just don&#x27;t want anyone else to think they are getting a standard size can of hairspray like I did which is why I am also providing a picture.  My cordless phone is almost bigger than this can of hairspray.</li>
            <li> I really like that this hairspray has such a fine mist. It allows for a good amount of hold and yet still looks touchable. I can brush it out of my hair and not have any stickiness remain. If more hold is needed for a particular look this hairspray is easily build able. I find it to be a wonderful multi use product, (use on fine hairs around the hairline, use on a brush to tame eye brows, or all over for style hold) at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> Regardless of price (it&#x27;s the customers responsibility to shop around, isn&#x27;t it?) this hairspray is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and for some reason the spray in this size can and the 1.5 oz is finer than the spray in the 11oz can so I always use this size for home and the 1.5 oz for travel. LOVE it.</li>
            <li> The size was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Watch the size before you buy.  This is a travel size, and its ONE not two bottles.  Very expensive for a travel size!!</li>
            <li> Big fan and a nice deal. Better hairspray than plenty others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is hairspray. The end.</li>
            <li> Its exactly as described. There was a problem with the shipping but it was fixed soon and the seller was nice.</li>
            <li> yes, little big but perfect.  will do business again.  prefer if you have 2 oz or 3 oz cans. thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my aunt. Good price and nice small size. Easy for her to handle.</li>
            <li> Check the size.  It&#x27;s smaller than what you buy in the stores.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27; t be disappointed.  Only 4.2 ounces.  A very convenient size.  It packs great for a small trips. Handy.</li>
            <li> I used to use Shaper by Sabastian but it was much more expensive. In my opinion, this is just as good and MUCH less expensive. Holds but very touchable, doesn&#x27;t look or feel like hairspray</li>
            <li> Good hair spray, strong hold, matte finish. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while to finish off my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a travel size&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m less than thrilled to figure that out when it arrived</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite hairspray for a very very long time.  I guess I was in a hurry when I ordered this though, and didn&#x27;t realize these are not full size bottles.  Oh well, will still use the product, just wished I&#x27;d ordered the full size cans.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray but didn&#x27;t realize theses were smaller cans than I expected. My fault for not reading the fine print but I&#x27;ll continue to buy this hair spray,</li>
            <li> Best hair spray to use!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the strength for my thick hair!</li>
            <li> WHAT I EXPECTED - GOOD BRAND</li>
            <li> This is not my first choice; I prefer TRESemme TRES TWO-SPRAY ultra fine mist, which is what I thought I was ordering.  It has a gold stripe, not green.  The one I received is heavier and sticky, but I like the smaller size for travel.  I have not been able to find my preference in the smaller size.</li>
            <li> Works great but I didn&#x27;t realize I was buying the smaller cans instead of the full size.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small this bottle of hair spray is.</li>
            <li> If you like the feel of a helmet on your head</li>
            <li> Fits in my purse. Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife is semi-invalid, and has a hard time handling the large hairspray cans.  But the little travel size doesn&#x27;t even last a week.  This 4.2 oz. aerosol is just right for her.  We can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore, so having it available online is a help.</li>
