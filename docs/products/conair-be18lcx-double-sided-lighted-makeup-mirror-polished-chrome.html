            <li>This mirror is perfect for putting on makeup!</li>

            <li>I am giving it one star because I get better light looking in my wall</li>
            <li>Not much to say but works awesome.</li>
            <li>I love that you can flip it over to the more magnified mirror and the light is adequate.</li>
            <li>Product is fine and meets my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it has the bright \\&quot;Day\\&quot; switch and the magnified side as well as the regular mirror side.  </li>
            <li>The light stopped working immediately</li>
            <li>Great vanity mirror, with both regular reflection and magnified.</li>
            <li>This is a great looking mirror, and seems sturdy enough when you take it out of the package, set it up, and use it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a computer light, so</li>
            <li>my mirror is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Great, wife loves it, uses it daily for quite some time now.</li>
            <li>Love the different lighting effects and the magnifying mirror I can pluck my eyebrows really nicely.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how many positive reviews this product has gotten.  </li>
            <li>Sure, the first two light settings aren&#x27;t worth it but the \\&quot;office\\&quot; and \\&quot;day\\</li>
            <li>&quot; lights are bright enough.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like it does in the picture and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It has multiple light settings that illuminate the face well and also looks nice on the table.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too big, and sits on my vanity without taking up too much room, and looks very nice to boot.  </li>
            <li>She uses the day light setting, and on the magnified side can see exactly how her makeup looks on her.</li>
            <li>For the price this mirror is pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li>It is a large miror but has a small footprint which is perfect for the vanity she uses it on.</li>
            <li>The mirror is fine, the lighting not so much.</li>
            <li>Seems like it is made of cheap plastic, really should of been sturdier.  </li>
            <li>That alone is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Overall nice mirror - you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>After looking at reviews and different models I am buying this one again simply on basis of good balanced design, doesn&#x27;t use too much space, easy to put to side.</li>
            <li>But the color of the light on each setting is yellow, and I have to turn it to the very last setting to get the most light</li>
            <li>The only problem is that only one of the light settings gives any useful amount of light and even that one isn&#x27;t bright enough.</li>
            <li>I only use 2 of the settings, but who needs more?  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it in the morning when there is not enough natural light for me to put on my makeup.</li>
            <li>This one does not give off enought light, and gets hot to the touch even after ten minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>Works fine and has been moved around multiple times etc.  </li>
            <li>The four different settings of light is unlike anything I have seen.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend it!</li>
            <li>If you want that effect with this mirror, you&#x27;ll have to set up a flourescent light next to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like it</li>
            <li>Really tho, should be priced between 15 and $20.</li>
            <li>but, it does help me so much to get my eye liner and eye makeup</li>
            <li>You can really see how much makeup you are applying.  </li>
            <li>You definitely need additional light.</li>
            <li>With the light she can see for the  different channels to put make up on.</li>
            <li>Loved it at first, but all of sudden after a few months the settings stopped working.  </li>
            <li>so now I am able to put on my eye make-up with out fear I am makeing a mess.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>High quality mirror.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for your bathroom routine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m settling for this mirror only because after researching them, I haven&#x27;t found any other affordable lighted mirrors that are any better than this one.</li>
            <li>It does get a little hot if I use it for more than 30 min, but other than that</li>
            <li>And you can go directly to the Conair website and purchase the bulbs you need.  </li>
            <li>My old mirror lasted nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really neat to get up close and see what you are actually doing with your makeup.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this after having my old makeup mirror for 35  years.  </li>
            <li>Most ALL of them are not bright enough, get too hot or the magnification is just too much for regular make-up application.  </li>
            <li>This new one has never even been moved from it&#x27;s initial spot in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>the brushed steel looks snazzy and the mirrors are clear without any distortion (unless you count the magnification, of course!).</li>
            <li>I have left the light on for at least 10 times all day and so far I have not had to change out the bulb.  </li>
            <li>the settings before the last are dim.</li>
            <li>The low profile knob is nice looking but just a bit difficult to turn.</li>

            <li> Hopefully this one will last as long as my other mirror which just happened to be a Conair as well.  </li>
            <li> I look at the other brightness options: \\&quot;evening, home, office\\&quot; and regular mirror side after I have finished with the brightest \\&quot;day\\&quot; and adjust my makeup depending where I am going.</li>
            <li> Last week, this product, which is less than 1 yr old, just completely quit working except for one lighting setting which is only faintly lit (not at ALL the way it&#x27;s supposed to be, trust me).  </li>
            <li> But it is not really.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> It is so pretty on my dresser and looks expensive.  </li>
            <li> The mirror flips upside down to a magnification side, which is also lighted around the edge.  </li>
            <li> Also, the stand could be a little bit taller.</li>
            <li> this mirror was far less expensive than i could find \\&quot;in</li>
            <li> Nothing was wrong with my old one, but I wish I had kept it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk!</li>
            <li> It is actually metal - the entire frame and base.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find a product made so well in todays plastic market.  </li>
            <li> All of the settings were poorly lit, with the daylight one being the brightest.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say I will be returning it.  </li>
            <li> So sorry I did.</li>
            <li> VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT ON</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for putting on makeup! The four different settings of light is unlike anything I have seen. I highly reccommend it!</li>
            <li> Loved it at first, but all of sudden after a few months the settings stopped working.  It can now only be used on one of the lighting settings.  Part of the appeal had been the 4 different lighting settings and now they don&#x27;t work.  And of course the daytime one which is the brightest one and the one I use most oftern isn&#x27;t the one that still works.  Shouldn&#x27;t have stopped working well in such a short time.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Good price for a decent mirror! I&#x27;d buy this again if needed. It has multiple light settings that illuminate the face well and also looks nice on the table.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lighted mirror 5 years ago and I love it. It&#x27;s sturdy and the classic style looks great on my makeup table. I highly recommend it. Just note the replacement bulbs are not found at a local hardware store. They must be purchased from Conair online or at stores such as Bed, Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> I am looking for a replacement for this mirror I bought years ago. After looking at reviews and different models I am buying this one again simply on basis of good balanced design, doesn&#x27;t use too much space, easy to put to side. The light stopped working immediately so I but off the wire. Even then I like it better than any I looked at on line. See others in family grabbing and using also. It is just a good functioning design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement make-up mirror for a while.  Most ALL of them are not bright enough, get too hot or the magnification is just too much for regular make-up application.  Thankfully this make-up mirror works for me.  Sure, the first two light settings aren&#x27;t worth it but the \\&quot;office\\&quot; and \\&quot;day\\&quot; lights are bright enough. That alone is worth the price. And you can go directly to the Conair website and purchase the bulbs you need.  Hopefully this one will last as long as my other mirror which just happened to be a Conair as well.  My old mirror lasted nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, this mirror was just what she was looking for.  It looks good on the vanity and is easy to use.  She uses the day light setting, and on the magnified side can see exactly how her makeup looks on her.</li>
            <li> This makeup mirror has the poorest lighting of any I have ever used.  All of the settings were poorly lit, with the daylight one being the brightest.  I can&#x27;t believe how many positive reviews this product has gotten.  I am giving it one star because I get better light looking in my wall mounted bathroom mirror.  I will be sending this back immediately.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk!</li>
            <li> Great vanity mirror, with both regular reflection and magnified. If the oval shape were a bit wider (or even circular) it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a great looking mirror, and seems sturdy enough when you take it out of the package, set it up, and use it.  The mirror flips upside down to a magnification side, which is also lighted around the edge.  The only disappointment is that two of the light settings (Evening and Office) are too dim to be of any use.  Seems the Office setting was meant to mimic flourescent lighting, but this just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  If you want that effect with this mirror, you&#x27;ll have to set up a flourescent light next to it.  I&#x27;d really like it if *all* the settings were brighter.  I&#x27;m settling for this mirror only because after researching them, I haven&#x27;t found any other affordable lighted mirrors that are any better than this one.</li>
            <li> THE MIRROR IS NICE TO LOOK AT BUT DOESN&#x27;T PRODUCE ENOUGH LIGHTING. VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT ON MAKE UP.</li>
            <li> I decided to get this mirror after searching and searching for a plastic one with 4 settings (with no luck). I like my old Revlon one, but this one works perfectly well. I love that you can flip it over to the more magnified mirror and the light is adequate. The low profile knob is nice looking but just a bit difficult to turn. Also, the stand could be a little bit taller. Overall, I like it.</li>
            <li> For the price this mirror is pretty cheap.  Seems like it is made of cheap plastic, really should of been sturdier.  Other then that it serves the purpose.  Really tho, should be priced between 15 and $20.</li>
            <li> I am Reg&#x27;s wife, and I would recommend this mirror to anyone and will be buying one for all the ladies in my family.  It&#x27;s really neat to get up close and see what you are actually doing with your makeup.  Sometimes when I look on the magnified side I get a BIG shock......but, it does help me so much to get my eye liner and eye makeup just right.  It&#x27;s not too big, and sits on my vanity without taking up too much room, and looks very nice to boot.  I was introduced to this mirror at a hotel we stayed in recently, and just had to find one for myself after using it while on that trip.</li>
            <li> I love my Conair Makeup Mirror.  It is so pretty on my dresser and looks expensive.  But it is not really. I have had it a long time and I found the replacement bulbs on-line and they were fairly priced and easy to install.  I&#x27;m glad it has the bright \\&quot;Day\\&quot; switch and the magnified side as well as the regular mirror side.  I use the magnified side most.  You can really see how much makeup you are applying.  I look at the other brightness options: \\&quot;evening, home, office\\&quot; and regular mirror side after I have finished with the brightest \\&quot;day\\&quot; and adjust my makeup depending where I am going. I gave one as a Christmas gift.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> High quality mirror.  It is actually metal - the entire frame and base.  Hard to find a product made so well in todays plastic market.  Lights aren&#x27;t as bright as they could be, but they get the job done.  Lights do give off some heat - but in the winter I suppose it warms the bathroom a bit.  Overall nice mirror - you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. It is a large miror but has a small footprint which is perfect for the vanity she uses it on.</li>
            <li> I love my mirror.  I have been using a computer light, so my mirror is fabulous.  I only use 2 of the settings, but who needs more?  It looks nice, and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself looks very nice... the brushed steel looks snazzy and the mirrors are clear without any distortion (unless you count the magnification, of course!). The only problem is that only one of the light settings gives any useful amount of light and even that one isn&#x27;t bright enough. You definitely need additional light.</li>
            <li> Great, wife loves it, uses it daily for quite some time now.</li>
            <li> Gave as Birthday gift. Loves it. With the light she can see for the  different channels to put make up on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after having my old makeup mirror for 35  years.  Nothing was wrong with my old one, but I wish I had kept it.  This one does not give off enought light, and gets hot to the touch even after ten minutes or so.  Sorry to say I will be returning it.  I also would like more X&#x27;s of magnification.</li>
            <li> I love my lighted makeup mirror since I am a senior my vision isn&#x27;t up to par so now I am able to put on my eye make-up with out fear I am makeing a mess. On the neg. I can also see all the wrinkles LOL. I love my mirror. groovy mom</li>
            <li> this mirror was far less expensive than i could find \\&quot;in town\\&quot;.  It looks exactly like it does in the picture and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, and she loves it. She says the lighting is very good, with several options. She also likes the size. And it looks nice. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, all the lights work as described.  I use the &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; setting the most, it&#x27;s the brightest. It does get a little hot if I use it for more than 30 min, but other than that I haven&#x27;t found any flaws with it.</li>
            <li> Product is fine and meets my expectations.  Good product for the dollar investment.  Would suggest someone else to purchase this item in the future.</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine, the lighting not so much. I mostly use it in the morning when there is not enough natural light for me to put on my makeup. But the color of the light on each setting is yellow, and I have to turn it to the very last setting to get the most light the settings before the last are dim.</li>
            <li> I have had this mirror for two years.  I have left the light on for at least 10 times all day and so far I have not had to change out the bulb.  It does give off great lighting and the mirror is very large.  Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2012. Still working great up to this day.</li>
            <li> Do NOT purchase!  Last week, this product, which is less than 1 yr old, just completely quit working except for one lighting setting which is only faintly lit (not at ALL the way it&#x27;s supposed to be, trust me).  Thoroughly, a piece of junk.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  So sorry I did. I have another lighted makeup mirror, a different brand, which I&#x27;ve given my daughter and it&#x27;s still hanging in there after 15 years.  Works fine and has been moved around multiple times etc.  This new one has never even been moved from it&#x27;s initial spot in my bathroom. JUNK.</li>
            <li> I think this mirror is a great value. It looks similar to more expensive ones I have seen in Frontgate and in department stores.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great lighted mirror.  I can see my face now when I shave.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not much to say but works awesome. Love the different lighting effects and the magnifying mirror I can pluck my eyebrows really nicely. Very clean look in my bathroom. I love it. Highly recommend for your bathroom routine</li>
