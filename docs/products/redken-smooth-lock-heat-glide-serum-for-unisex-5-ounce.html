            <li>It&#x27;s THE BEST heat protectant/de-frizzing serum on the market (and I&#x27;ve tried alot)!</li>
            <li>I read about this product and heard nothing but good reviews.</li>
            <li>good price on amazon</li>
            <li>Which everyone around you will be very glad of.</li>
            <li>The old formula was awesome and this one is just as great.</li>
            <li>LOVE it still!</li>
            <li>, this serum its amazing, protects hair againt heat damage, and helps a lot with the frizz.</li>
            <li>use!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li>of all, it made my over processed hair feel somewhat more manageable and healthier after 1</li>
            <li>Often companies change things and not for the better.</li>
            <li>It makes it shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>I will probably buy it again since it works better than the biosilk for heat protection.</li>
            <li>There are much better products out there.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It seems to protect my hair from damaging heat, it smells really good, &amp; it makes my hair shiny &amp; very straight.</li>
            <li>I have not yet start using the product Redken Smooth Lock Heat Glide Serum for Unisex.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>This Smooth Lock Heat Glide formula replaced the product I was using.</li>
            <li>But it really does work great and gives good results when blow drying with a round brush.</li>
            <li>I prefer the original formula over this one.</li>
            <li>I already have tried several like this, but never found one too nice!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight serum that definitely helps me have good hair days in the Texas humidity.  </li>
            <li>When you go to add more, it&#x27;s too much and leaves my hair sticky.</li>
            <li>, im transitioning right now</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s best when you put it in wet hair and then blow dry.</li>
            <li>This is one item that is just as good if not better than the original.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions, and use only &amp;#34;1 pump&amp;#34; on this product on towel dried hair, it is really excellent.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product, even for fine hair.</li>
            <li>well i use too much bcs</li>
            <li>very light.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>I really like this heat protectant.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need to use much.</li>
            <li>Like a review said, it can get greasy, but she&#x27;s probably using way too much.</li>
            <li>It still leaves your hair protected and shiny, but I feel like the other formulation locked in more moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years, it last a really long time and is the best product for my thick unruly hair!</li>
            <li>The Smooth Lock line has replaced the previous Smooth Down series of products and seems to work about the same except that they have added large amounts of perfume to the formulation.</li>
            <li>but you have to be careful how much you apply, it can look very greasy.</li>
            <li>my hair its naturally curly</li>
            <li>It may feel that way, only, if you use so much of the product.</li>
            <li>I only need two pumps to do my whole head of hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using the same bottle for over a year, and it works very well,&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>good stuff, bit expensive, but</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really put it on dry hair.</li>
            <li>and i flat iron my hair once a week and cant live without it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really feels like it is protecting my hair from the excessive heat I use.  </li>
            <li> it lasts such a long time.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way- 1 or 2 pumps for short hair.</li>
            <li> My hair its very, very, very  dry</li>
            <li> It was thick and sticky- and left my hair feeling weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would add smoothness and shine without weighing down my hair.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt  make my hair  weigh  down or anything, and the people who said it does needs to learn how to use it depending on their hair type .</li>
            <li> The scent is a little perfume nutty</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and next time I&#x27;ll try using maybe a dime size.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, but works for my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> WAY too thick to thoroughly spread through the hair.</li>
            <li> Probably 2 if your hair is really thick like mine.&lt;br /&gt;worth</li>
            <li> /&gt;i doesnt smell bad and last.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have not yet start using the product Redken Smooth Lock Heat Glide Serum for Unisex. But the product came on time and looked like the picture advertisement.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would add smoothness and shine without weighing down my hair.  I would definitely recommend this product, even for fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair its very, very, very  dry, this serum its amazing, protects hair againt heat damage, and helps a lot with the frizz., just gets rid off it . my hair its naturally curly, im transitioning right now and i flat iron my hair once a week and cant live without it .&lt;br /&gt;i doesnt smell bad and last. well i use too much bcs it doesnt  make my hair  weigh  down or anything, and the people who said it does needs to learn how to use it depending on their hair type . But i prefer have a lillte greasy hair that all that freeze and dryness look</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why someone will say that this product is somewhat greasy. It may feel that way, only, if you use so much of the product. If you follow the directions, and use only &amp;#34;1 pump&amp;#34; on this product on towel dried hair, it is really excellent. And feels very light.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it made my over processed hair feel somewhat more manageable and healthier after 1 use!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!!! BTW, I&#x27;d give another 5 stars for the sellers EXCELLENT shipping time!</li>
            <li> They changed this formula and I was unsure if I was going to like it. LOVE it still! The old formula was awesome and this one is just as great. Often companies change things and not for the better. This is one item that is just as good if not better than the original. The scent is a little perfume nutty but once I applied I don&#x27;t smell it. Leaves my hair so silky and smooth. Last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It&#x27;s THE BEST heat protectant/de-frizzing serum on the market (and I&#x27;ve tried alot)! Buy this, you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> Works well but you have to be careful how much you apply, it can look very greasy. I have very thick curly hair and next time I&#x27;ll try using maybe a dime size.</li>
            <li> I really like this heat protectant. It&#x27;s a bit sticky so it&#x27;s best when you put it in wet hair and then blow dry. Can&#x27;t really put it on dry hair. Because of that, I also I have to pick up a spray. But it really does work great and gives good results when blow drying with a round brush. Sleek results. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and still have quite a bit left. Only takes 2 pumps for me and my hair is to my butt.</li>
            <li> I read about this product and heard nothing but good reviews. It lives up to the reviews. It seems to protect my hair from damaging heat, it smells really good, &amp; it makes my hair shiny &amp; very straight. You don&#x27;t even need to use much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years, it last a really long time and is the best product for my thick unruly hair! It makes it shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> I have been using Redken Heat Glide for years. This Smooth Lock Heat Glide formula replaced the product I was using. I have shoulder length, relaxed, 4C hair. I only need two pumps to do my whole head of hair. Like a review said, it can get greasy, but she&#x27;s probably using way too much. I prefer the original formula over this one. It still leaves your hair protected and shiny, but I feel like the other formulation locked in more moisture. So I&#x27;m a little disappointed. I will probably buy it again since it works better than the biosilk for heat protection.</li>
            <li> I use it a lot during the days to help flatten my hair.</li>
            <li> I already have tried several like this, but never found one too nice!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product.  It was thick and sticky- and left my hair feeling weighed down.  There are much better products out there.</li>
            <li> good stuff, bit expensive, but good price on amazon</li>
            <li> The Smooth Lock line has replaced the previous Smooth Down series of products and seems to work about the same except that they have added large amounts of perfume to the formulation. The perfume does not dissipate so you will reek of obnoxious scent until you change your loyalty to a different brand of hair product. Which everyone around you will be very glad of.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lightweight serum that definitely helps me have good hair days in the Texas humidity.  Doesn&#x27;t even feel like I have product in my hair.</li>
            <li> WAY too thick to thoroughly spread through the hair. When you go to add more, it&#x27;s too much and leaves my hair sticky. Definitely won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts forever. I have been using the same bottle for over a year, and it works very well,&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way- 1 or 2 pumps for short hair. Probably 2 if your hair is really thick like mine.&lt;br /&gt;worth the price since the product works and it lasts such a long time.</li>
            <li> Really feels like it is protecting my hair from the excessive heat I use.  It is very thick, but works for my coarse hair.</li>
