            <li>It also has a wonderful smell to it :)</li>
            <li>and I actually really liked it!</li>
            <li>However, I love it and think it looks great on me!  </li>
            <li>perfect - love this color -  </li>
            <li>We all have our own color preferences!  </li>
            <li>Glides on easily and matches my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t beat a good lipstick like this.  </li>
            <li>The quality is great &amp; I honestly get compliments everytime</li>
            <li>I loved the thought of this &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; color, but it is not nude rather a rosy brown.</li>
            <li>I love this color, it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite NYX products - great nude look on lips.</li>
            <li>Very lovely color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad i decided to purchase this lipstick!</li>
            <li>But who knows, you might love it like I ended up loving it!</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick!</li>
            <li>Its my first lipstick I have bought that I&#x27;m completely happy with and don&#x27;t have buyers remorse!</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick!</li>
            <li>Ok, this is not the \\&quot;nude\\&quot; you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li>I am SO thrilled that I went ahead and purchased it because I absolutely LOVE this color on my skin tone!</li>
            <li>The color is nice although it is a bit darker than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>The texture is nice and creamy and long-lasting too.</li>
            <li>and i liked it..</li>
            <li>More of a purple tint than I was expecting, but still good.</li>
            <li>, now I know why Thalia is a popular color.</li>
            <li>it is a nice feel and has staying power, ust not the color I was looking for and thought I was getting.</li>
            <li>The lipstick stays on fairly well and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Awesome colour and very cred</li>
            <li>Nice color but not even close to what you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;ll get from the picture</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the color that I&#x27;ve been looking, love everything about it: is so creamy, nice case.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a rose mauve than anything.</li>
            <li>To me, a quality lipstick is one that goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t sticky and feels good on your lips.  </li>
            <li>They claimed it had a great smell and was very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>The color is just lighter than my own lip color, so it looks very natural, but mostly it feels really good!</li>
            <li>Thalia appears to be more of a pinky color in the image of the lips and lipstick, but in reality it is more of a purpley color.  </li>
            <li>And I found the color to be long-lasting, which is just as important as moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I will be buying this the rest of my life:)</li>
            <li>but I heard this color works well with many skin types</li>
            <li>Love this lip cream.</li>
            <li>shame because it&#x27;s such a wonderful color and feels wonderful too, like regular lip cream.</li>
            <li>Love NYX lip creams.</li>
            <li>I love the color - but don&#x27;t love the lack of staying power for this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is so freaking cheap, but it stays on longer than $30 lipsticks that I own.  </li>
            <li>I have a medium skin tone and with one application, I love the way it looks on my lips; any more than one layer</li>
            <li>it is kind of nude with light  purple shade?</li>
            <li>You will love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a fantastic lip cream!</li>
            <li>:) the end</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color and the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about it except the color.</li>
            <li>Definitely love</li>
            <li>and it looks okay on me</li>
            <li>I LOVE that this has no weird tastes/scents - huge win for me.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it is a very cool tone, and maybe that&#x27;s why it can look purple-ish on some.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered a tube of this lipstick and it was the most fabulous color I had ever worn.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color, I&#x27;m more of a sheer gloss person myself</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect nude with pink undertones.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth glide of the cream as I put it on and it does make my lips softer.  </li>
            <li>I love the smooth application, the texture and smell.  </li>
            <li>It smooth and creamy and goes on easily...</li>
            <li>First and most importantly (to me), I personally love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>The lipstick goes on very nicely and does not dry your lips.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very pretty!  </li>
            <li>Im fairlly light.</li>
            <li>My rating would be a 5 star if I was given another one of these products free of charge as a replacement for the mishap.</li>
            <li>glides on smooth.</li>
            <li>and it starts to look too light.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth</li>
            <li>I smooth it out with my index finger or a lipstick brush</li>
            <li>Thank you for fast shipping too!!!</li>
            <li>An amazing delicious creamy long lasting color XD</li>
            <li>I got this lipstick today and was so excited for it until I tried it on, and it looks nothing like the color that is pictured here.</li>
            <li>but its okay cause is longlasting and i put lip pencil first then this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Wife says looks great, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t get sticky or clumpy.  </li>
            <li>Polished, clean, look.</li>
            <li>The color is a great nude because it is not too pink nor too brown.  </li>
            <li>Love with it fast delivery</li>
            <li>Regarding color, it&#x27;s true what a lot of people say:</li>
            <li>My lips are naturally very light, so it is more than pigmented enough to show up on me.  </li>
            <li>I ordered four more of them (when I find something I love, it invariably gets discontinued shortly thereafter)</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite shades out of the many different NYX cosmetic lipsticks.</li>
            <li>luckily, i still like the color</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and is very creamy in texture.</li>
            <li>But the color does last for a fair amount of time and it is pretty moisturizing for a non-glossy lipstick.</li>
            <li>It also looks very natural, just a bit more polished.  </li>
            <li>Never bought too many NYX products in the past, but with recent hype I&#x27;ve been trying their lipliners and lipsticks and I&#x27;ve been very happy!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a rose mauve and is very rich and dark on me.</li>
            <li>Look fresh for spring..</li>
            <li>I am giving this product a 5 star because it is the best lipstick color I have ever tired.</li>
            <li>It looks good, for about a half hour -</li>
            <li>This is my new fave!!!</li>
            <li>When I first saw the images of this lipstick color online, I knew I wanted to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>photo(the first one).</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with the color (it actually was the color shown on the website! )</li>
            <li>While the pictures showed a more soft pink, this lip color is more of a mauve-ish brown.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color</li>
            <li>Definitely try it if you are Indian :)</li>
            <li>this year think I will look for some other colors because it&#x27;s such a great value.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is very creamy and goes on with ease.</li>
            <li>It makes your lip feel soft and look fresh.</li>
            <li>The lipstick was very creamy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I purchased this a couple days ago, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I wish they would put up photos that really portray the product correctly.</li>
            <li>I really like this color because it looks very neutral.</li>
            <li>Very Neutral and Would Recommend.</li>
            <li>Very creamy</li>
            <li>This lipstick feels really moisturizing and luscious.  </li>
            <li>But for $4.50, I can&#x27;t really complain too much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Very creamy and all the rage</li>
            <li>Think it is much darker than it appears in photo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It glides on creamy, and looks very nude.</li>
            <li>so it sets more pink.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would really be unflattering on anyone, though.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it makes my lips feel.</li>
            <li>It just really very neutral.  </li>
            <li>the color of the lipstick looks absolutely nothing like the pictures posted.</li>
            <li>I agree with an earlier reviewer that it provides a clean, polished look.  </li>
            <li>Also, it goes on smooth and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much more purple and dark.</li>
            <li>My natural lip color is a pinkish...almost plum purple...and this lipstick matched it exactly.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, the most appealing image (the picture that made me desire to buy) of this lipstick is NOT what it is in person.</li>
            <li>I purchased a lipstick last summer, #610 Celebration, and I love it, especially because the label indicated that the product was cruelty-free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular color again, I will be finding a darker one in this brand.  </li>
            <li>Such a pretty color!</li>
            <li>It is a great lipstick but the color was all wrong for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It now my favorite color, i wear it almost everyday!</li>
            <li>and my skin tone is almost exactly matched to the one in the third photo.</li>
            <li>really pretty simple color.  </li>
            <li>The color is very pretty and the lipstick is not drying like some of the other cheaper brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>But I am upset because my product came damaged and it would cost too much effort and time to ship back and return.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft but not heavy.</li>
            <li>I have pale skin and blonde hair, and I love this color.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last a long time on the lips, but I don&#x27;t really mind.  </li>
            <li>The bottom of the lipstick is clear so you can see the actual color without opening the stick; this is helpful it</li>
            <li>I just wrote to NYX and I asked the company to go back to the old formula.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not a huge deal as I usually slick on some lip gloss over my lipsticks anyway, so I wear a lighter pink/peach color on top of this</li>
            <li>its a little too much creamy for my taste..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it&#x27;s very pretty!  </li>
            <li> Im fairlly light.</li>
            <li> My rating would be a 5 star if I was given another one of these products free of charge as a replacement for the mishap.</li>
            <li> glides on smooth.</li>
            <li> and it starts to look too light.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth</li>
            <li> I smooth it out with my index finger or a lipstick brush</li>
            <li> Thank you for fast shipping too!!!</li>
            <li> An amazing delicious creamy long lasting color XD</li>
            <li> I got this lipstick today and was so excited for it until I tried it on, and it looks nothing like the color that is pictured here.</li>
            <li> but its okay cause is longlasting and i put lip pencil first then this lipstick.</li>
            <li> Wife says looks great, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t get sticky or clumpy.  </li>
            <li> Polished, clean, look.</li>
            <li> The color is a great nude because it is not too pink nor too brown.  </li>
            <li> Love with it fast delivery</li>
            <li> Regarding color, it&#x27;s true what a lot of people say:</li>
            <li> My lips are naturally very light, so it is more than pigmented enough to show up on me.  </li>
            <li> I ordered four more of them (when I find something I love, it invariably gets discontinued shortly thereafter)</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shades out of the many different NYX cosmetic lipsticks.</li>
            <li> luckily, i still like the color</li>
            <li> Very pretty color.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and is very creamy in texture.</li>
            <li> But the color does last for a fair amount of time and it is pretty moisturizing for a non-glossy lipstick.</li>
            <li> It also looks very natural, just a bit more polished.  </li>
            <li> Never bought too many NYX products in the past, but with recent hype I&#x27;ve been trying their lipliners and lipsticks and I&#x27;ve been very happy!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a rose mauve and is very rich and dark on me.</li>
            <li> Look fresh for spring..</li>
            <li> I am giving this product a 5 star because it is the best lipstick color I have ever tired.</li>
            <li> It looks good, for about a half hour -</li>
            <li> This is my new fave!!!</li>
            <li> When I first saw the images of this lipstick color online, I knew I wanted to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> photo(the first one).</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with the color (it actually was the color shown on the website! )</li>
            <li> While the pictures showed a more soft pink, this lip color is more of a mauve-ish brown.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color</li>
            <li> Definitely try it if you are Indian :)</li>
            <li> this year think I will look for some other colors because it&#x27;s such a great value.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is very creamy and goes on with ease.</li>
            <li> It makes your lip feel soft and look fresh.</li>
            <li> The lipstick was very creamy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple days ago, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I wish they would put up photos that really portray the product correctly.</li>
            <li> I really like this color because it looks very neutral.</li>
            <li> Very Neutral and Would Recommend.</li>
            <li> Very creamy</li>
            <li> This lipstick feels really moisturizing and luscious.  </li>
            <li> But for $4.50, I can&#x27;t really complain too much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Very creamy and all the rage</li>
            <li> Think it is much darker than it appears in photo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It glides on creamy, and looks very nude.</li>
            <li> so it sets more pink.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would really be unflattering on anyone, though.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my lips feel.</li>
            <li> It just really very neutral.  </li>
            <li> the color of the lipstick looks absolutely nothing like the pictures posted.</li>
            <li> I agree with an earlier reviewer that it provides a clean, polished look.  </li>
            <li> Also, it goes on smooth and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much more purple and dark.</li>
            <li> My natural lip color is a pinkish...almost plum purple...and this lipstick matched it exactly.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the most appealing image (the picture that made me desire to buy) of this lipstick is NOT what it is in person.</li>
            <li> I purchased a lipstick last summer, #610 Celebration, and I love it, especially because the label indicated that the product was cruelty-free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular color again, I will be finding a darker one in this brand.  </li>
            <li> Such a pretty color!</li>
            <li> It is a great lipstick but the color was all wrong for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It now my favorite color, i wear it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> and my skin tone is almost exactly matched to the one in the third photo.</li>
            <li> really pretty simple color.  </li>
            <li> The color is very pretty and the lipstick is not drying like some of the other cheaper brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> But I am upset because my product came damaged and it would cost too much effort and time to ship back and return.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft but not heavy.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and blonde hair, and I love this color.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last a long time on the lips, but I don&#x27;t really mind.  </li>
            <li> The bottom of the lipstick is clear so you can see the actual color without opening the stick; this is helpful it</li>
            <li> I just wrote to NYX and I asked the company to go back to the old formula.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not a huge deal as I usually slick on some lip gloss over my lipsticks anyway, so I wear a lighter pink/peach color on top of this</li>
            <li> its a little too much creamy for my taste..</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time finding suitable lipsticks and other types of makeup because of my allergies to fragrance and heavy-chemical cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not care for with this lipstick is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> the color isn&#x27;t too bad, but it&#x27;s not necessarily one that I would have gotten on my own.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s mostly a disappointment because you were expecting one thing but got a darker, more purple color instead.</li>
            <li> It is sort of glossy, not matte but stays on for a long time.  </li>
            <li> After reading the previous reviews I had my doubts about purchasing this lipstick, but I thought \\&quot;why not try it out for myself, especially since it&#x27;s only $5\\&quot;</li>
            <li> just pat dry if you want it mate.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I usually love NYX products.</li>
            <li> I purchased the color based on the third photo expecting it to be at least similar....</li>
            <li> If I had to say one thing, BE WARNED that this lipstick is NOT as pink as it may seem in the photos.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go too pink with another shade, and have it be much pink....</li>
            <li> Open the lipstick a few moments ago and found it about to fall off the stick.</li>
            <li> i would not have bought this if i had known how pink it was</li>
            <li> However, it is pink.</li>
            <li> The color is lighter than I expected it to be</li>
            <li> I too would call it a nude with pink undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product was all that i had expected it to be. . .I</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have called it \\&quot;purple\\&quot; and I would have to disagree with that.  </li>
            <li> very pink...</li>
            <li> However, the color is darker on me than it was on the model in Pinterest, so it&#x27;s not right for me.</li>
            <li> At least it is for me, and I&#x27;ve been through a lot of lipsticks that claim to be moisturizing and fall short.</li>
            <li> Its suppose to be a nude but it looked dark purple on me.</li>
            <li> its like dark purple...not even slightly nude or pinkish.</li>
            <li> As with all NYX round lipsticks, the consistency is extremely creamy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that&#x27;s a little nude in color, and this did the job.</li>
            <li> While this color goes on lighter than I anticipated, it seems to darken a little bit afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Definitively I&#x27;ll continue buying NYX Round Lipsticks.</li>
            <li> (why I don&#x27;t purchase the typical makeup brands at common retailers).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed....</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Not able to use it it turned purple on my lips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite amused at all the negative reviews of lipstick because someone may not like the color.  </li>
            <li> and while they had the same name and number, They were a totally different color and looked horrible on me.</li>
            <li> Two weeks ago (October 2014), I purchased a different color lipstick and was disappointed to discover that it had added chemicals and fragrance.</li>
            <li> Rather annoyed.</li>
            <li> sad.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> not too flashy, i would think compliments any season.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s a bit unfair to review a lipstick based on color.  </li>
            <li> Probably got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate when there&#x27;s a chemical taste/fragrance to it</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed but then thank God i found it on Amazon!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect lipstick!!!! The color is great. It also has a wonderful smell to it :) It last awhile and I have revived a lot of compliments. Thank you for fast shipping too!!!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is a great color for day or night, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got this lipstick today and was so excited for it until I tried it on, and it looks nothing like the color that is pictured here. It&#x27;s so much more purple and dark. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad i decided to purchase this lipstick! It now my favorite color, i wear it almost everyday! Great buy</li>
            <li> this color looks NOTHING  like the shared reviewers photos. its like dark purple...not even slightly nude or pinkish. sad. i&#x27;ll never wear this shade.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the images of this lipstick color online, I knew I wanted to purchase it.  Needless to say, the most appealing image (the picture that made me desire to buy) of this lipstick is NOT what it is in person. After reading the previous reviews I had my doubts about purchasing this lipstick, but I thought \\&quot;why not try it out for myself, especially since it&#x27;s only $5\\&quot;.....So I went ahead and bought it anyway! Thalia appears to be more of a pinky color in the image of the lips and lipstick, but in reality it is more of a purpley color.  I am SO thrilled that I went ahead and purchased it because I absolutely LOVE this color on my skin tone! If I had to say one thing, BE WARNED that this lipstick is NOT as pink as it may seem in the photos. But who knows, you might love it like I ended up loving it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the color that I&#x27;ve been looking, love everything about it: is so creamy, nice case. Definitively I&#x27;ll continue buying NYX Round Lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a tube of this lipstick and it was the most fabulous color I had ever worn.  I ordered four more of them (when I find something I love, it invariably gets discontinued shortly thereafter) and while they had the same name and number, They were a totally different color and looked horrible on me. So sad.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is very creamy and goes on with ease. It makes your lip feel soft and look fresh. The only thing I do not care for with this lipstick is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> Like the description says, its creamy. At least it is for me, and I&#x27;ve been through a lot of lipsticks that claim to be moisturizing and fall short. And I found the color to be long-lasting, which is just as important as moisturizing!</li>
            <li> As with all NYX round lipsticks, the consistency is extremely creamy. This color comes off as mauve/rose with neutral undertones.</li>
            <li> I am hispanic and heard great reviews about this lipstick so decided to purchase it. It is a great lipstick but the color was all wrong for my skin tone. Im fairlly light. Its suppose to be a nude but it looked dark purple on me. I will definantly purchase another NYX lipstick but not this color. The lipstick was very creamy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I saw pictures of this lipstick color on Pinterest and had to have it.  I looked for it in 3 Ulta stores since it does not seem to be carried anywhere else and it was always out of stock.  I found it on Amazon for the same price.  The color is very pretty and the lipstick is not drying like some of the other cheaper brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Doesn&#x27;t last a long time on the lips, but I don&#x27;t really mind.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple days ago, fast shipping. I purchased the color based on the third photo expecting it to be at least similar....and it wasn&#x27;t. My natural lip color is a pinkish...almost plum purple...and this lipstick matched it exactly. There was no difference in color on me at all. It&#x27;s like a wasn&#x27;t even wearing anything..and my skin tone is almost exactly matched to the one in the third photo. I didn&#x27;t want to go too pink with another shade, and have it be much pink....but this was definitely not my shade...or others shade apparently.&lt;br /&gt;So if you want a plum-purple-pink shade, order this color. If not, like me, I suggest trying a lighter color like \\&quot;Paris\\&quot;. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed....the color doesn&#x27;t even look like stock photo(the first one). I wish they would put up photos that really portray the product correctly.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat a good lipstick like this.  The color is nice although it is a bit darker than I was expecting.  But that&#x27;s not a huge deal as I usually slick on some lip gloss over my lipsticks anyway, so I wear a lighter pink/peach color on top of this and it&#x27;s very pretty!  The texture is nice and creamy and long-lasting too.</li>
            <li> Those looking for a nudish-pink color this is the lipstick for you.  It is sort of glossy, not matte but stays on for a long time.  I really like this color because it looks very neutral.</li>
            <li> This is my new fave!!! The quality is great &amp; I honestly get compliments everytime I wear it! I will be buying this the rest of my life:)</li>
            <li> I found this lipstick on Pinterest.  They claimed it had a great smell and was very reasonably priced.  I agree with both.  However, the color is darker on me than it was on the model in Pinterest, so it&#x27;s not right for me.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, I&#x27;m more of a sheer gloss person myself but I heard this color works well with many skin types and I actually really liked it! Never bought too many NYX products in the past, but with recent hype I&#x27;ve been trying their lipliners and lipsticks and I&#x27;ve been very happy!</li>
            <li> Love this lip cream. Great buy.cute color</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, awesome, creamy consistency.  Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I just wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> I saw this lipstick on a tutorial video and i decided to order without knowing how the texture is gonna be.. and i liked it.. its a little too much creamy for my taste.. but its okay cause is longlasting and i put lip pencil first then this lipstick.</li>
            <li> Rather annoyed. Open the lipstick a few moments ago and found it about to fall off the stick. Probably got a bad batch. Will probably buy this again some time in a store or at Ulta :/ shame because it&#x27;s such a wonderful color and feels wonderful too, like regular lip cream. Love NYX lip creams. But I am upset because my product came damaged and it would cost too much effort and time to ship back and return. My rating would be a 5 star if I was given another one of these products free of charge as a replacement for the mishap.</li>
            <li> color is different in person... very pink... i would not have bought this if i had known how pink it was</li>
            <li> Love with it fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great item. I still use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Great Lip Cream. Beautiful Color. I was looking for something that&#x27;s a little nude in color, and this did the job. Very Neutral and Would Recommend.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite NYX products - great nude look on lips. glides on smooth. Polished, clean, look.</li>
            <li> Great color bought it twice!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! Perfect color for my brown skintone! Very creamy and you don&#x27;t need to add any extra gloss as opposed to the matte nyx products.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with the color (it actually was the color shown on the website! ) and wear of the product.</li>
            <li> I love the color - but don&#x27;t love the lack of staying power for this lipstick.  It looks good, for about a half hour - then it&#x27;s gone.  Too bad because I usually love NYX products.</li>
            <li> This lipstick feels really moisturizing and luscious.  The color is just lighter than my own lip color, so it looks very natural, but mostly it feels really good!</li>
            <li> More of a purple tint than I was expecting, but still good. 5 stars on shipping.</li>
            <li> omg perfect kylie jenner mauvy color. so beautiful!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is so freaking cheap, but it stays on longer than $30 lipsticks that I own.  It really is a great color.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase this after seeing it circulate the Pinterest world.  While the pictures showed a more soft pink, this lip color is more of a mauve-ish brown.  However, I love it and think it looks great on me!  Also, it goes on smooth and lasts for a long time.  I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I like the lip color. It goes on easily and is very creamy in texture. However, it is pink. It is not as pictured at all. It is not a nude color. I still like it but the pictures are misleading. But for $4.50, I can&#x27;t really complain too much.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product 6 stars I would. Great quality, great color, great price. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> perfect - love this color -  thanks</li>
            <li> Not able to use it it turned purple on my lips I am a Brunette</li>
            <li> Great great color and price. Look fresh for spring..Very creamy and all the rage this year think I will look for some other colors because it&#x27;s such a great value.</li>
            <li> The color is lighter than I expected it to be but I do like it I juust add a lip liner and gloss to darken the color but I do use it every chance I get. I like it alot and it was delivered in only 4 days.</li>
            <li> Read people raving about the color. Not true-to-color as I have seen in photo&#x27;s of this lipstick. Think it is much darker than it appears in photo&#x27;s. Was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased a lipstick last summer, #610 Celebration, and I love it, especially because the label indicated that the product was cruelty-free and hypoallergenic. Two weeks ago (October 2014), I purchased a different color lipstick and was disappointed to discover that it had added chemicals and fragrance. I had to return it. I have a difficult time finding suitable lipsticks and other types of makeup because of my allergies to fragrance and heavy-chemical cosmetics. I just wrote to NYX and I asked the company to go back to the old formula. Hypoallergenic and cruelty-free products never hurt anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fussy about lipstick. I hate when there&#x27;s a chemical taste/fragrance to it (why I don&#x27;t purchase the typical makeup brands at common retailers). I LOVE that this has no weird tastes/scents - huge win for me.  Regarding color, it&#x27;s true what a lot of people say: it&#x27;s more of a rose mauve than anything. I have a medium skin tone and with one application, I love the way it looks on my lips; any more than one layer and it starts to look too light. But the color does last for a fair amount of time and it is pretty moisturizing for a non-glossy lipstick.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, love, love, love it. The bottom of the lipstick is clear so you can see the actual color without opening the stick; this is helpful it you have several shades.</li>
            <li> An amazing delicious creamy long lasting color XD it is kind of nude with light  purple shade? You will love it</li>
            <li> really pretty simple color.  not too flashy, i would think compliments any season.  a rosey nude-ish hue. goes on smooth</li>
            <li> This lipstick stays on all day</li>
            <li> I am not one to wear lipstick but this has made the exception! It&#x27;s the perfect nude with pink undertones. It glides on creamy, and looks very nude. I smooth it out with my index finger or a lipstick brush so it sets more pink. Its my first lipstick I have bought that I&#x27;m completely happy with and don&#x27;t have buyers remorse!</li>
            <li> Wife says looks great, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t get sticky or clumpy.  She also loves the color...and so do I.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. Glides on easily and matches my skin tone perfectly. It&#x27;s a purplish brownish color. Very lovely color, now I know why Thalia is a popular color.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! It is creamy enough without looking over glossy. I get tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color! This is one of my favorite shades out of the many different NYX cosmetic lipsticks. I definitely recommend for anyone that loves a nude/ mauve lip color.</li>
            <li> I been looking for a nude color an this color was perfect.I would recommend this lipstick to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This shade works no matter what color your skin tone is, it makes you go from frumpy to glamorous in a minute. It smooth and creamy and goes on easily...I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and blonde hair, and I love this color.  My lips are naturally very light, so it is more than pigmented enough to show up on me.  It also looks very natural, just a bit more polished.  Other reviewers have called it \\&quot;purple\\&quot; and I would have to disagree with that.  I will say that it is a very cool tone, and maybe that&#x27;s why it can look purple-ish on some.  I don&#x27;t think it would really be unflattering on anyone, though.  At this price, it can&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> While this color goes on lighter than I anticipated, it seems to darken a little bit afterwards.  I love the smooth glide of the cream as I put it on and it does make my lips softer.  While I wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular color again, I will be finding a darker one in this brand.  I really like how it makes my lips feel. It&#x27;s just a fantastic lip cream! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I loved the thought of this &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; color, but it is not nude rather a rosy brown. it is a nice feel and has staying power, ust not the color I was looking for and thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> Ok, this is not the \\&quot;nude\\&quot; you&#x27;re looking for! It&#x27;s a pretty color but it&#x27;s a rose mauve and is very rich and dark on me. It&#x27;s not what your looking for if you found this on pintrest it&#x27;s a knock off . :) the end</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing in on Pintrest, which I seem to be doing a lot!  I absolutely love this color and the quality of the product.  The color is a great nude because it is not too pink nor too brown.  It just really very neutral.  The lipstick stays on fairly well and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> i read the reviews, and still decided to purchase the thalia lipstick. I love everything about it except the color. the color isn&#x27;t too bad, but it&#x27;s not necessarily one that I would have gotten on my own. Also, it&#x27;s mostly a disappointment because you were expecting one thing but got a darker, more purple color instead.</li>
            <li> First and most importantly (to me), I personally love this lipstick.  I love the smooth application, the texture and smell.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that it provides a clean, polished look.  I too would call it a nude with pink undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s a bit unfair to review a lipstick based on color.  We all have our own color preferences!  What may be &#x27;nude&#x27; to one person, isn&#x27;t to another.  And We know that colors on the &#x27;web can be truly deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m quite amused at all the negative reviews of lipstick because someone may not like the color.  To me, a quality lipstick is one that goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t sticky and feels good on your lips.  :^D</li>
            <li> I am giving this product a 5 star because it is the best lipstick color I have ever tired. The lipstick goes on very nicely and does not dry your lips. Definitely try it if you are Indian :)</li>
            <li> this product was all that i had expected it to be. . .I recently ordered one from nyx website and the color was a bit different eventhough it was the same Thalia. I was a bit disappointed but then thank God i found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Awesome colour and very cred but doesn&#x27;t really last</li>
            <li> I love this color, it&#x27;s beautiful. If you&#x27;re looking for the Kylie Jenner lip color this is it, just pat dry if you want it mate. Which is what I do, everyone compliments my lips all the time! I&#x27;m Hispanic, yellow browinsh skin time and it looks great on me. Definitely love</li>
            <li> Nice color but not even close to what you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;ll get from the picture</li>
            <li> the color of the lipstick looks absolutely nothing like the pictures posted. there&#x27;s nothing nude about it. luckily, i still like the color and it looks okay on me so i&#x27;m keeping it. it&#x27;s like a deep pink/purple color. i also like how the product feels on my lips. it&#x27;s soft but not heavy. great product, just misleading photos.</li>
