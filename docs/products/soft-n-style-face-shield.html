            <li>Great invention.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Hair spray isn&#x27;t good for your skin, so I took a chance and ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>Service good.</li>
            <li>I am sure it works great for sitting stationary and applying hairspray, it just doesn&#x27;t work for what I need.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective, and cleans easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>The best part was having my ex-fiance become my new trashman!</li>
            <li>good product must keep clean.</li>
            <li>Without being able to see where I&#x27;m aiming my hair product, what&#x27;s the point??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but cleans up ok.</li>
            <li>This is okay</li>
            <li>ordered 5 to make sure had.</li>
            <li>pleased with the item</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible and my daughter can use it.</li>
            <li>Really cheap and really effective.</li>
            <li>but if it were made of a flexible material it would be easier to protect the neck and sides of the face better.</li>
            <li>OK so the view through the shield is a bit distorted</li>
            <li>The plastic it is made of easily cracks and breaks as well.</li>
            <li>Product brittle, easy to break, but it works</li>
            <li>Great for personal use and clients.</li>
            <li>Keeps the face free of spray and toxins</li>
            <li>I eventually became a huge star and married a famous actor.  </li>
            <li>Can be effective if the person whose face is being protected does not need to have a clear line of sight</li>
            <li>It does work better with short hair styles, so I&#x27;ll probably use it more once I have my hair cut.</li>
            <li>This shield is exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>i use this every morning.&lt;br /&gt;it works very well and light to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the mobey.</li>
            <li>but it would be nicer if the plastic was more clear.  </li>
            <li>Just rinse under warm water to wash, simple.</li>
            <li>Handle snapped off right after I got it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i bought the clear one and do like it since i can see when i use the spray.&lt;br /&gt;very useful!!</li>
            <li>First let me state</li>
            <li>rinse it with hot water after each use</li>
            <li>and I lost all 134 pounds and on top of that an extra 15!</li>
            <li>It defitnaly transformed my whole life!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>handle broke first use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, easy to clean, and has a small hole on the handle so you can hang it if you wish.</li>
            <li>While this would work fine for a general face cover while using hairspray, I specifically needed it to cover my forehead while spraying my side-swept bangs.</li>
            <li>While the size and strength are what I had hoped for, the visible clarity leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>Light, durable, simple, and never wears out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very basic--a plastic shield that the person holds agains their face</li>
            <li>and you can spray their whole head--</li>
            <li>This product may just be at convienet product for those who want get rid of sticky hair spray in their face, but for me it was a real life savor.  </li>
            <li>With &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; in the name I expected a more pliable material.  </li>
            <li>I expected to be able to see through the shield</li>
            <li>and I really couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I think one half this size would be better.  </li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t keep your eyes in that spot it can become highly disorienting.</li>
            <li>Feeling helpless and no motivation to live</li>
            <li>He told me he had a job for me in a new movie.  </li>
            <li>Wow I don&#x27;t know where I would be without my Hair Spray Shield!</li>
            <li>Used 2 have these when I was a teen &amp; first started doin hair,am def.</li>
            <li>So far, I have not received a new one in the mail.</li>
            <li>a name like \\&quot;soft &#x27;N style\\</li>
            <li>It will with stand a direct shot from a gun but then smashes the shield into your nose.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of using this shield possibly because I wear glasses or because my hair is much longer now than when I purchased the shield.  </li>
            <li>only this one was clear.</li>
            <li>super hard to find anywhere but Amazon.</li>
            <li>For many years I would spray my hair everyday and unknownly get chemicals in my face and down my throat.  </li>
            <li>When mommy wants to use a little hairspray, it no longer gets in her face.</li>

            <li> You can see well through the flat sections</li>
            <li> While the coverage is fine, it is very hard to actually spray the small area needed because the visibility of the plastic is so fuzzy.</li>
            <li> Due to the manufacturing process there are multiple creases and deformations on the inside of the shield, causing severe vision distortions; like folding glass and looking through the creases.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick plastic and not wide enough for me to put on my face with the glasses on, it also distorts vision.  </li>
            <li> After about a year of doing this I developed a horrible cough that prevented me from doing many physical activities that kept me in shape.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but then I always closed my eyes when I applied hairspray.</li>
            <li> I would prefer to do one side then the other.  </li>
            <li> and whenever I sprayed my hair I used this product and no chemicals went down my throat.  </li>
            <li> Then one day I was discovered walking down the street by an agent for actresses.  </li>
            <li> Hairspray really irritates my face bad and turns me really red</li>
            <li> This product advertises itself as light protection from grinding or cutting, but one would think of you&#x27;re grinding or cutting anything, whether in the home, kitchen or garage, you&#x27;ll need a clear and undistorted vision.  </li>
            <li> and she uses it everyday when spraying her hair.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a lot of hairspray on the shield and very little on my hair.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m sending this one back unfortunately.</li>
            <li> No more .....</li>
            <li> was getting acne on my face from the hairspray clogging my pores, no more, my face is cleared up.</li>
            <li> I do have a hard time seeing out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it 2 stars because it is made of a thick, durable plastic that can handle drops on a hard floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , i.e. a 2nd person is cutting a kid&#x27;s hair or a hair stylist is working on the person holding it during the hairspray period.  </li>
            <li> At least I can now see where I am spraying.</li>
            <li> The plastic is too thick and it doesn&#x27;t cover the forehead like I would like it to.</li>
            <li> No more hairspray on my face!</li>
            <li> it functions in the exact way it claims, and keeps that nasty hairspray off my skin.  </li>
            <li> This Face Shield arrived in the mail broken.</li>
            <li> I have a broken nose now</li>
            <li> This product fails in that regard, when the person using it is using it for him/herself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tossed it the day I got it, useless.</li>
            <li> My eyes were uncomfortable (strained).  </li>
            <li> I have very poor vision and wear glasses, I wanted this to provide me a way to see where I&#x27;m spraying without messing up my lenses (hairspray will ruin lense  treatments like the anti-glare).  </li>
            <li> so I do not recommend for a face shield could be dangerous.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself because I thought it would protect me during painful paintball matches.</li>
            <li> At the moment I seem to do just as well using my hand to protect my ears or face from the annoying blast of hair spray.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the follow up service.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First let me state this was purchased to see if it would work as a costume component. While the size and strength are what I had hoped for, the visible clarity leaves much to be desired. Due to the manufacturing process there are multiple creases and deformations on the inside of the shield, causing severe vision distortions; like folding glass and looking through the creases. You can see well through the flat sections but if you don&#x27;t keep your eyes in that spot it can become highly disorienting. I am sure it works great for sitting stationary and applying hairspray, it just doesn&#x27;t work for what I need. I am putting this in our make up kit for Halloween, maybe we can use it for face-painting and such.</li>
            <li> Purchased for use with our grandson. He hates getting hair in his face when he is getting a haircut. Works as it should</li>
            <li> This product advertises itself as light protection from grinding or cutting, but one would think of you&#x27;re grinding or cutting anything, whether in the home, kitchen or garage, you&#x27;ll need a clear and undistorted vision.  This product fails in that regard, when the person using it is using it for him/herself.  Can be effective if the person whose face is being protected does not need to have a clear line of sight, i.e. a 2nd person is cutting a kid&#x27;s hair or a hair stylist is working on the person holding it during the hairspray period.  I&#x27;ll give it 2 stars because it is made of a thick, durable plastic that can handle drops on a hard floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a name like \\&quot;soft &#x27;N style\\&quot; you would think they were marketing this product for use in the bathroom for grooming (namely to protect your face when applying hairspray).  This is what I bought it for.  Without being able to see where I&#x27;m aiming my hair product, what&#x27;s the point??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tossed it the day I got it, useless.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this face shield. When mommy wants to use a little hairspray, it no longer gets in her face. Light, durable, simple, and never wears out. Well worth the mobey.</li>
            <li> This Face Shield arrived in the mail broken. I contacted both Amazon and the Store and they were soposed to replace it. So far, I have not received a new one in the mail. I am very disappointed in the follow up service.</li>
            <li> I have COPD and hair spray products are a problem. This shield is exactly what I needed!  It gets cloudy pretty&lt;br /&gt;Quickly, but cleans up ok.</li>
            <li> While this would work fine for a general face cover while using hairspray, I specifically needed it to cover my forehead while spraying my side-swept bangs. While the coverage is fine, it is very hard to actually spray the small area needed because the visibility of the plastic is so fuzzy. I ended up with a lot of hairspray on the shield and very little on my hair.</li>
            <li> Use this when applying hairspray.  Protects my face...does the job. It&#x27;s light weight, easy to clean, and has a small hole on the handle so you can hang it if you wish.</li>
            <li> The plastic is too thick and it doesn&#x27;t cover the forehead like I would like it to. The plastic it is made of easily cracks and breaks as well. I think I&#x27;m sending this one back unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This shield works great for protecting eyes and face from hairspray. You can have great hair without a sticky face!</li>
            <li> It does what it is suppose to do well.  It keeps hair spray or any spray off your face.  No more ..... OMG, I&#x27;ve been blinded by hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just rinse it with hot water after each use and it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my  mom and she uses it everyday when spraying her hair. She loves it, it protects her from getting the hairspray all over her face. Great invention.</li>
            <li> i use this every morning.&lt;br /&gt;it works very well and light to handle.&lt;br /&gt;i bought the clear one and do like it since i can see when i use the spray.&lt;br /&gt;very useful!!</li>
            <li> I tried various Beauty Supply shops but could not find this face shield.  I use it to protect my Mother&#x27;s face when I spray her hair after I&#x27;ve styled it.  This is a very good product.  It&#x27;s very basic--a plastic shield that the person holds agains their face and you can spray their whole head--no particles get on their face or eyes.  You can find just about EVERYTHING on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like my shied. It protects my clients eyes from product when I spray anything, including male balding spray. I think it is an must in every hair or makeup kit.</li>
            <li> This is okay but it would be nicer if the plastic was more clear.  I do have a hard time seeing out of it.</li>
            <li> super hard to find anywhere but Amazon. ordered 5 to make sure had. will break over time from drooping and travel . good product must keep clean.</li>
            <li> No more hairspray on my face!</li>
            <li> This product may just be at convienet product for those who want get rid of sticky hair spray in their face, but for me it was a real life savor.  For many years I would spray my hair everyday and unknownly get chemicals in my face and down my throat.  After about a year of doing this I developed a horrible cough that prevented me from doing many physical activities that kept me in shape.  Because of this I gained about 134 pounds and my fiance left me because he was no longer attracted to me.  He took all my money including my house so I was left homeless living in a box on the side of the street.  Feeling helpless and no motivation to live I was searching through the trast the find something to eat when I came across this product.  I decided to give it a chance and whenever I sprayed my hair I used this product and no chemicals went down my throat.  This is eventually made my health return and I lost all 134 pounds and on top of that an extra 15! Then one day I was discovered walking down the street by an agent for actresses.  He told me he had a job for me in a new movie.  I eventually became a huge star and married a famous actor.  The best part was having my ex-fiance become my new trashman! Wow I don&#x27;t know where I would be without my Hair Spray Shield! It defitnaly transformed my whole life!</li>
            <li> This face sheild keeps me from breathing in hairspray which is a greaat thing since I am recovering from lung cancer and don&#x27;t want to breathe in any chemicals! Great product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself because I thought it would protect me during painful paintball matches. It will with stand a direct shot from a gun but then smashes the shield into your nose. I have a broken nose now so I do not recommend for a face shield could be dangerous.</li>
            <li> Handle snapped off right after I got it.</li>
            <li> Used 2 have these when I was a teen &amp; first started doin hair,am def. pleased with the item-It arrived in a couple of days &amp; as described-Great 2 have when hair products are being sprayed!</li>
            <li> Great for personal use and clients. Keeps the face free of spray and toxins</li>
            <li> was getting acne on my face from the hairspray clogging my pores, no more, my face is cleared up. Just rinse under warm water to wash, simple.</li>
            <li> Everytme I would use my hairspray I would get a breakout. So I decided I needed another one of those face shields like I had years ago only this one was clear. Well Its just what I wanted, its perfect and I can see through it to see where I&#x27;m spraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value and speedy service all around</li>
            <li> I have very poor vision and wear glasses, I wanted this to provide me a way to see where I&#x27;m spraying without messing up my lenses (hairspray will ruin lense  treatments like the anti-glare).  It&#x27;s a thick plastic and not wide enough for me to put on my face with the glasses on, it also distorts vision.  With &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; in the name I expected a more pliable material.  It&#x27;s not horrible and my daughter can use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  it functions in the exact way it claims, and keeps that nasty hairspray off my skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I think one half this size would be better.  I would prefer to do one side then the other.  Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Really cheap and really effective.</li>
            <li> perfect for getting hairspray on my bangs and not my face</li>
            <li> I returned this product.  It was not for me. I expected to be able to see through the shield and I really couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Hairspray really irritates my face bad and turns me really red and sometimes I end up having to wash my face again. With this, it stays off my face and doesn&#x27;t make me have to wash and re-do my makeup. It saves my skin and my time. Great product.</li>
            <li> This works well but if it were made of a flexible material it would be easier to protect the neck and sides of the face better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of using this shield possibly because I wear glasses or because my hair is much longer now than when I purchased the shield.  At the moment I seem to do just as well using my hand to protect my ears or face from the annoying blast of hair spray.  I agree that washing it after each use maintains the transparency of the shield. It does work better with short hair styles, so I&#x27;ll probably use it more once I have my hair cut.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for years. OK so the view through the shield is a bit distorted but then I always closed my eyes when I applied hairspray. At least I can now see where I am spraying.</li>
            <li> handle broke first use</li>
            <li> Hair spray isn&#x27;t good for your skin, so I took a chance and ordered this product.  It&#x27;s very effective, and cleans easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Service good. Product brittle, easy to break, but it works</li>
            <li> Viewing through the face shield into the mirror was a somewhat distorted image.  My eyes were uncomfortable (strained).  I knew immediately I was going to return it.&lt;br /&gt;For the reason that using the shield results in seeing a distorted image reflection in the mirror I would not recommend this product.</li>
