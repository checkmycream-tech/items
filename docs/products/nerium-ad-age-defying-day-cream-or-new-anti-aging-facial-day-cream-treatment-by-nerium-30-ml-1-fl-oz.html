            <li>Within three weeks my skin was looking extra great.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and just love this cream!</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this product needs to be in its original packaging.</li>
            <li>Great age defying results that&#x27;s expected with the Nerium brand.</li>
            <li>This product has successfully kept my very dry skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>Ok....so there is a lot of good questions people have been asking on here about this product and a lot of them are unanswered.</li>
            <li>Worth a try, ladies.</li>
            <li>Amazjng results!&lt;br /&gt;Period , it&#x27;s worth each penny you pay for.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and will order it again.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I look 10 years younger!!</li>
            <li>but my first one should have lasted weeks longer.  </li>
            <li>I really love this facial</li>
            <li>My face is smoother and my deep wrinkles have started to look much better.</li>
            <li>I love this product but I am not 100% convinced that when ordering other than from the company directly I am getting a full bottle.  </li>
            <li>I decided to sell the product myself BECAUSE it really works</li>
            <li>Really helps control oily skin.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I would rather order when ready here.  </li>
            <li>I really should set up a calendar and mark off the number of pumps I get one of these times.</li>
            <li>Pump only work for week cheaply made</li>
            <li>As with the night cream I like the product so much I have started selling it.</li>
            <li>The proprietary blend NAE-8 becomes inactive outside of its original packaging after 8-12 hours.</li>
            <li>Nerium is my new favorite face product...have spent a fortune in the past trying different products and this is by far my favorite</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>not sure if I would buy it again and glad that I bought it at a discounted rate.</li>
            <li>As a direct Brand Partner for Nerium</li>
            <li>It has completely transformed my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft as well.</li>
            <li>My skin is supple and soft and issues with hormonal blemishes are gone.</li>
            <li>So far the products is doing what it says it can do.</li>
            <li>Would not pay direct market price</li>
            <li>I have developed some blemishes after using it</li>
            <li>In other words, with Nerium you can try the product for &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; and if you don&#x27;t like it you can return it in its original packaging to include the receipt and you have your MONEY BACK!</li>
            <li>I came across this product on Amazon and went with it because of the massive reviews and high rating.</li>
            <li>I did experience a change in my skin the first couple of weeks, not really a breakout but some roughness.</li>
            <li>and you will be billed every month on the same day and sent a new product to continue using</li>
            <li>I have had such good results with this that I get sad when the bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>I struggled with on and off acne and using this day and night for only a couple days completely cleared it up!</li>
            <li>so when two women I recently met said this stuff works, I naturally had my doubts.  </li>
            <li>Be warned, you may experience a few breakouts at first, but keep using, now that I have been using it on a regular bases I actually have STOPPED breaking out at all.</li>

            <li> No more dark spots or acne scars.</li>
            <li> Nerium has a shelf life on its products, so, if this has been sitting in the warehouse OR a garage for a long time to extreme temperatures, then its rendered useless which can cause some people to breakout.</li>
            <li> not sure whether it&#x27;s making a difference or not.  </li>
            <li> Also, the dispensing mechanism does not have a cap and small amounts of the product dries and crusts which is wasteful.</li>
            <li> If so, it&#x27;s subtle.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is no way to tell if the pump malfunctioned and any was still in the bottle</li>
            <li> A bit expensive if no results though.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok....so there is a lot of good questions people have been asking on here about this product and a lot of them are unanswered. I will say that I am very happy that Amazon is beginning to advertise this and sell the product BUT there is a few things that you want to consider before you buy from the Amazon seller. I decided to sell the product myself BECAUSE it really works and I want to make people happy! As a direct Brand Partner for Nerium I will say the following:  1. Keep in mind that this product needs to be in its original packaging. The proprietary blend NAE-8 becomes inactive outside of its original packaging after 8-12 hours. This in itself is an important fact to know! 2. Amazon nor its seller guarantee a 30 day money back for this product. In other words, with Nerium you can try the product for &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; and if you don&#x27;t like it you can return it in its original packaging to include the receipt and you have your MONEY BACK! 3. Nerium has a shelf life on its products, so, if this has been sitting in the warehouse OR a garage for a long time to extreme temperatures, then its rendered useless which can cause some people to breakout. 4. The prices on here for this product are the same, give or take a few dollars, as if you were a &amp;#34;preferred customer&amp;#34; through Nerium. As a &amp;#34;preferred customer&amp;#34; all you do is enter your credit card and you will be billed every month on the same day and sent a new product to continue using OR you can sign up as a preferred customer buy the product and then cancel or personalize it to your personal need.  I have no reason to lie about this. So, you can take a risk buying from here or I would be more than happy to be your contact for buying this product. Just go to.... eogalan.nerium.com .I hope I was able to answer lots of the concerns on here! Again, this product really works and does amazing things to peoples skins!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Arrived very quickly in excellent condition. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really helps control oily skin.</li>
            <li> Just invest in botox!  The cream is not going to erase your wrinkles.  I used it as directed and didn&#x27;t help at all.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A+++ my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I look 10 years younger!!</li>
            <li> ...so when two women I recently met said this stuff works, I naturally had my doubts.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on an inconsistent basis for about 3 weeks I guess.  I like what I see when I look in the mirror.  Is it the Nerium?  I can&#x27;t say for sure but I don&#x27;t care - if I feel I look good, then it is good.  The lotion itself is nicely emollient and is absorbed into the skin fairly quickly.  I like that.  It has a &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; feel which I guess is what&#x27;s credited with it&#x27;s &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;, but the jury&#x27;s still out.  If I continue to like what I see, I may continue with this product.  Worth a try, ladies.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and just love this cream!</li>
            <li> a really nice day cream, would not want to be without it. Ophelia at O Spa Salon told me about it, have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> Combined with the night cream this is awesome I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Fast service and great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for awhile and I notice a good feel to my skin.</li>
            <li> This face cream is excellent. I look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> I love this product but I am not 100% convinced that when ordering other than from the company directly I am getting a full bottle.  I did not mark the calendar but my first one should have lasted weeks longer.  I only use 2 or 3 pumps a day and I don&#x27;t think it lasted a month.  Unfortunately there is no way to tell if the pump malfunctioned and any was still in the bottle so I just tried again as I do not wish to set up auto delivery again and end up with bottles stacking up.  Never found the way on the site to customize my delivery schedule. I would rather order when ready here.  I really should set up a calendar and mark off the number of pumps I get one of these times.</li>
            <li> I really love this facial cream.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nice,and is not oily.&lt;br /&gt;It helps soften my face,and helps with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love it better than anything I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a few weeks and can tell a difference.  My skin is tighter and firm.  This stuff works and will be buying more product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium now for several months. Day and night cream. It&#x27;s AMAZING! It has completely transformed my skin. It&#x27;s so even and glowy. No more dark spots or acne scars. It&#x27;s so soft as well. I go to the gym without a stitch of makeup bc it&#x27;s made my skin so nice. Be warned, you may experience a few breakouts at first, but keep using, now that I have been using it on a regular bases I actually have STOPPED breaking out at all. It&#x27;s been months since I have had a pimple:) honestly best stuff ever( and the best part for me, it&#x27;s safe for your body and health!)</li>
            <li> Pump only work for week cheaply made</li>
            <li> Amazjng results!&lt;br /&gt;Period , it&#x27;s worth each penny you pay for.</li>
            <li> As with the night defying treatment. I have had such good results with this that I get sad when the bottle runs out. My skin is supple and soft and issues with hormonal blemishes are gone.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My face is smoother and my deep wrinkles have started to look much better. As with the night cream I like the product so much I have started selling it. So far the products is doing what it says it can do.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It is great for your face. I feel like I am not aging like I used to.</li>
            <li> Did not expect such a deal</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am happy that AMAZON has the bestprice...</li>
            <li> Great delivery time. Great price. Great age defying results that&#x27;s expected with the Nerium brand.</li>
            <li> Would not pay direct market price but I like it under foundation. I have developed some blemishes after using it but I believe that sometimes is a sign it is working to renew the surface. I&#x27;ll give the bottle a chance.</li>
            <li> not sure whether it&#x27;s making a difference or not.  If so, it&#x27;s subtle.  No allergic reaction to it, even when close to eyes.  A bit expensive if no results though.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t continue this use</li>
            <li> i love this, so easy to apply, and it makes your skin feel wonderful</li>
            <li> it worked okay but not as well as it states it does. not sure if I would buy it again and glad that I bought it at a discounted rate.</li>
            <li> The product works well however I cannot deal with the scent. I find it offensive and the scent does not dissipate as the day goes on. Also, the dispensing mechanism does not have a cap and small amounts of the product dries and crusts which is wasteful.</li>
            <li> LOVE this day cream.  I struggled with on and off acne and using this day and night for only a couple days completely cleared it up! I have now used it for 30 days and see lines getting visibly smaller... will continue to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> This product has successfully kept my very dry skin moisturized. I like it very much and will order it again.</li>
            <li> I came across this product on Amazon and went with it because of the massive reviews and high rating. I am absolutely thrilled with it! I did experience a change in my skin the first couple of weeks, not really a breakout but some roughness. I remembered reading about that and continued using it. Within three weeks my skin was looking extra great. I get compliments on it regularly. Big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Nerium is my new favorite face product...have spent a fortune in the past trying different products and this is by far my favorite</li>
