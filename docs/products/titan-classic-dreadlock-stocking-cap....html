            <li>Very strong stocking cap.</li>
            <li>the banding was very comfortable.</li>
            <li>*, it slides on real smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>Would have been better if it had a wider reinforced band around it.  </li>
            <li>This product works great, but it raised my temperature so much, I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>

            <li>LOVE THIS...</li>
            <li>SHIP IN A TIMELY MANNER AND IS BETTER THAN HOW</li>
            <li>Better than a rag.</li>
            <li>But it does hold my locs in pretty good.</li>
            <li>The material was so light weight and breathable</li>
            <li>My hair is below my shoulders and I can fit it all in this stocking cap.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply Made....  </li>
            <li>Overall a very very strong product for what you pay for it really nice .</li>
            <li>It fits nicely and it was able to stretch enough to fit all of my locs.</li>
            <li>But will not support the full weight of my locks.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, definitely going to order again and add to my product staple.</li>
            <li>Good make &amp; material,to long for me though</li>
            <li>Free locks fit nice and tight....</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to find something to fit mine</li>
            <li>The elastic on the cap wears out pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>These work great for my dreadlocks which are about 3 inches past my shoulders</li>
            <li>It can cover my long locs and I am able to throw them in the washer and dryer to clean them.</li>
            <li>I like this particular stocking cap because it held my locs up and off the back of my neck, nice and roomy for my hair and</li>
            <li>Hot, hot, hot.</li>
            <li>My scalp gets too hot and starts to itch profusely.</li>
            <li>Ripped the first day I got  it</li>
            <li>Fast transaction!</li>
            <li>If you keep things cold, this will protect your hair and it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>Fit as expected, was pleased and will by from the seller in the future</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product for those that want to cover up their locs.</li>
            <li>A+ thanks</li>
            <li>Hair gotta grow a little more tho</li>
            <li>Nice and thick</li>
            <li>&amp; I have butt long locks, more suitable for long thick locks.</li>
            <li>Product holds my locs up &amp; in place like the picture, while being light weight &amp; not to tight on my head.</li>
            <li>WORK WELL WITH ALL NATURAL HAIR STYLES...</li>
            <li>the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far is a satin draw string laundry bag, but its not very comfortable and looks silly, I guess I will keep looking!</li>
            <li>Doesnt last long at all, looses its elasticity very fast</li>
            <li>Its great for my husbands lower back length locks, out in the garden, chicken coop &amp; greenhouses all day working in the dirt</li>

            <li> Its great for my husbands lower back length locks, out in the garden, chicken coop &amp; greenhouses all day working in the dirt</li>
            <li> What I like most about it is that it&#x27;s thin and when I wear it in the shower my locs can reap the benefits of the steam without getting wet.</li>
            <li> Will most likely have to end up tying an ugly knot in it.</li>
            <li> Band around hairline is too loose and gets looser with each wear.</li>
            <li> I have tried other supposed &amp;#34;dreadloc caps&amp;#34; and they were either too tight on my head, not roomy enough for my hair or made with non-breathable materials.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have extremely long dreads, I mean like dreads to your back etc, you might need something else.</li>
            <li> Its not to tight nor to loose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too tight like the other ones that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t fit my locks :(</li>
            <li> but they are down past my knees...</li>
            <li> Pure Crap...</li>
            <li> I decided to try this stocking cap because it&#x27;s thin and would allow air to get to my scalp.</li>
            <li> come tough like den ladies like it!</li>
            <li> Which is sad.</li>
            <li> now dont have to wear an uncomfortable du rag or get my hair caught in something when I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> I hate tying my locs up at night.</li>

            <li> Product was of good quality as advertised</li>
            <li> Keeps your locks neat and in place.</li>
            <li> Band around hairline is too loose and gets looser with each wear. I keep having to pull it forward during the night. Would have been better if it had a wider reinforced band around it.  But it does hold my locs in pretty good. Will most likely have to end up tying an ugly knot in it.</li>
            <li> Hot, hot, hot. This product works great, but it raised my temperature so much, I couldn&#x27;t use it. If you keep things cold, this will protect your hair and it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Quick arrival, great product! Keeps my dreads out of my face and I can sleep comfortably! It never comes off. I don&#x27;t fancy salon dreads so mi have Congo locks! Nice and thick come tough like den ladies like it!</li>
            <li> Product holds my locs up &amp; in place like the picture, while being light weight &amp; not to tight on my head.</li>
            <li> Fits great. Hair gotta grow a little more tho lol</li>
            <li> Good make &amp; material,to long for me though &amp; I have butt long locks, more suitable for long thick locks. Also the piece of cardboard in the packaging, which is place inside the stocking, leaves it deform/slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> Fit as expected, was pleased and will by from the seller in the future</li>
            <li> I have tried other supposed &amp;#34;dreadloc caps&amp;#34; and they were either too tight on my head, not roomy enough for my hair or made with non-breathable materials. I like this particular stocking cap because it held my locs up and off the back of my neck, nice and roomy for my hair and the banding was very comfortable. The material was so light weight and breathable that I forgot I had it on. Very pleased, definitely going to order again and add to my product staple.</li>
            <li> I just got mine today. This is a very nice product. Fits nice, Its not to tight nor to loose. Overall a very very strong product for what you pay for it really nice . 💯👌.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  I can&#x27;t find these locally.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my dreads while at work or anywhere that I need to keep my hair out of my face and out of the elements.  My hair is below my shoulders and I can fit it all in this stocking cap.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is what ive been searching for. Tried many a lot failed. However I found it in my local beauty store</li>
            <li> Cant take it off, my fiancee loves the look of it on me. I needed this after cotton kept getting onto my tips, but that isnt a problem anymore!</li>
            <li> Cheaply Made....  Pure Crap...</li>
            <li> I hate tying my locs up at night. My scalp gets too hot and starts to itch profusely. I decided to try this stocking cap because it&#x27;s thin and would allow air to get to my scalp. I really like it. My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch when I wear it.  It fits nicely and it was able to stretch enough to fit all of my locs. What I like most about it is that it&#x27;s thin and when I wear it in the shower my locs can reap the benefits of the steam without getting wet.</li>
            <li> Loved it but i just found a rip in mine. Dont know how it happened so i need to order another one asap.</li>
            <li> Doesnt last long at all, looses its elasticity very fast</li>
            <li> Free locks fit nice and tight....work well  for my locks</li>
            <li> This product was THE S***, it slides on real smooth and easy. It&#x27;s not too tight like the other ones that I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s netted mesh let&#x27;s your hair breathe. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have extremely long dreads, I mean like dreads to your back etc, you might need something else.</li>
            <li> Very good for my free formed locs</li>
            <li> Very strong stocking cap. It can cover my long locs and I am able to throw them in the washer and dryer to clean them. I always buy these stocking caps.</li>
            <li> Its great for my husbands lower back length locks, out in the garden, chicken coop &amp; greenhouses all day working in the dirt it keeps them out of his way and for sleeping....but it doesn&#x27;t fit my locks :( I was really hoping to find something to fit mine but they are down past my knees...the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far is a satin draw string laundry bag, but its not very comfortable and looks silly, I guess I will keep looking!</li>
            <li> The elastic on the cap wears out pretty quickly.  Which is sad. The cap falls off of my head in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> Just like the brown one that I purchased it fits all my locs..comfortable to wear while sleeping..really love my purchase.</li>
            <li> Ripped the first day I got  it</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product for those that want to cover up their locs. I will buy more of these. now dont have to wear an uncomfortable du rag or get my hair caught in something when I&#x27;m sleeping. its good for going in town too.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS... WORK WELL WITH ALL NATURAL HAIR STYLES... I ENDED UP ORDERING ANOTHER.. SHIP IN A TIMELY MANNER AND IS BETTER THAN HOW ITS ADVERTIZED... DONT HAVE A 2ND THOUGHT BUY IF ITS SOMETHING YOU NEED</li>

            <li> Christmas for the Rasta Kids</li>
            <li> Better than a rag. But will not support the full weight of my locks.</li>
            <li> These work great for my dreadlocks which are about 3 inches past my shoulders, They keep all the fuzz balls out of my hair while I sleep. I also use these at the gym to keep my hair up and out of the way.</li>
