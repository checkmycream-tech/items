            <li>I put it on, and within about two hours caught myself licking my finger after eating something delicious.</li>
            <li>&quot; and it is marvelous, for it does everything that this product doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>lol!  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to everyone I know and would recommend it to anyone it is a great product.</li>
            <li>and I applied weekly until it was no longer a temptation to nibble my nails, 5 stars for successfully breaking the habit ^o-)b</li>
            <li>My nails are growing healthy and look great.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s good) and lasts for many days.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Mavala Stop\\&quot; product worked much better.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a polish, its more of a oil.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time but the seal on the bottle could have been better..</li>
            <li>but then you get used to it really quick</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;ll be spending the money for a better product next time...</li>
            <li>but the person has to be willing to quit becase you apply this bite ender two times a week.</li>
            <li>if you are consistent in using it, I think it works.</li>
            <li>Well, I bought this product for my daughter who has been biting her nails pretty much since birth.</li>
            <li>there wasn&#x27;t much of a taste that bothered me.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product !</li>
            <li>This item works very well for stopping biting nails</li>
            <li>really would recommend it,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has any will to stop.  </li>
            <li>I like it and highly recommended this for anyone that has a nail biting habit.</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop is worth the extra three dollars</li>
            <li>I have used it a few times since the initial application just to be safe, but I haven&#x27;t bitten once since that first application.    </li>
            <li>The product did not taste completely horrible which some true nail bitters may be able to ignore but it is a good reminder, which is what has helped me stop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing more than clear nail polish, which I could have bought locally for a lot less and not had to pay shipping.</li>
            <li>The 4 year old didn&#x27;t even notice it on his nail.</li>
            <li>The 9 year old said</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my eight year old daughter who bites her nails.  </li>
            <li>My 6 years old picks this product</li>
            <li>I bought this when my 2 year old started biting her nails copying a boy in his class.  </li>
            <li>I noticed on another review here someone mentioned some stuff called \\&quot;Mavala Stop\\&quot; and that apparently that worked for them.</li>
            <li>It is definitely the strongest on the first day; an application every other day or so will keep you from even thinking about biting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear nail polish which I didn&#x27;t really expect since I had bought other similar items to fight my habit which were like gels and actually became faint easily, but since it is polish it sticks around</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had been biting my nails incessantly for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll spent purchasing it, unlike the Bite Ender, which I want my six dollars back for.</li>
            <li> As long as I remember to put it on it works quite well..</li>
            <li> and i have been a severe nail bitter my since i can remember.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I saw that my nails looked much healthier and my little nail biting habit was no more.</li>
            <li> I was a little doubtful at first but my first use was as it said.</li>
            <li> It is only slightly noticable to the eye (a very slight varnish to the nail...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad that he actually gagged and threw up one of the first times he had it on.</li>
            <li> He said the stuff tasted nasty, and it probably would have done the trick if it didn&#x27;t make his nails bright and shiny.</li>
            <li> (A little too well--if she wasn&#x27;t careful she would taste it when she ate food with her hands!)</li>
            <li> I got this to try to stop and it worked for the first day or so because I was afraid of tasting the stuff.</li>
            <li> I am desperately trying to stop biting my finger nails, and this was the first product I tried.  </li>
            <li> This is a very thin product also and does not last long before washing/flaking off.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to give it 5 stars yaknow since it tastes awful and all, but yes that is a good quality here, it did its intended job.</li>
            <li> As I waited the few days for it to arrive</li>
            <li> I will have to see if I donÂ´t forget putting it everyday</li>
            <li> first it tastes bad</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t stopped the habit but it helped slow it down.</li>
            <li> so I put it only on the base of his nail near the cuticle</li>
            <li> I continued ripping my fingers apart as usual, then it arrived today.</li>
            <li> It does not have a nasty taste or smell at all, and it comes off your nails easily after a days use.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that this product does not have ANY bitter flavor, or anything to dissuade you from biting your nails.  </li>
            <li> the taste is enough to remind you not to bite, but not so horrible you want to gag..</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase this product it is like a miracle worker</li>
            <li> if it works again, at least I have tasted it and leaves an awful taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> it supposedly have a bad taste did not.</li>
            <li> I get that bad taste</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not so bad anymore.\\</li>
            <li> It is VERY bad tasting</li>
            <li> That stuff tastes NASTY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> His fingernails were the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has a horrible cuticle biting habit.</li>
            <li> My daughter says it tastes nasty as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I had been biting my nails incessantly for as long as I can remember.  My parents once tried to get me to stop and gave me something similar to this product, but I just fought through it until I could bite again.  Well, I finally had enough (aka, my girlfriend didn&#x27;t like it) and so it was time for me to stop.    One application of this stuff did the trick!  The stuff tastes foul (that&#x27;s good) and lasts for many days.  It is definitely the strongest on the first day; an application every other day or so will keep you from even thinking about biting.  I have used it a few times since the initial application just to be safe, but I haven&#x27;t bitten once since that first application.    It is only slightly noticable to the eye (a very slight varnish to the nail...but I&#x27;m a dude and it wasn&#x27;t bothersome), and it stopped a master of nail biting.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has any will to stop.  And to those of you who don&#x27;t want to, it&#x27;ll probably work too.  It tastes horrible and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> We used it on our son to get him to stop sucking his thumb. Worked like a charm. It is VERY bad tasting so I put it only on the base of his nail near the cuticle so he wouldn&#x27;t get any in his mouth while eating finger food. It&#x27;s so bad that he actually gagged and threw up one of the first times he had it on. He soon learned not to suck his thumb. I put bandaids over his thumbs at night so he wouldn&#x27;t get it in his mouth in the middle of the night. The only Con is that you have to reapply it every couple of days.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try this after loosing a different product.  I was disappointed to find that this product does not have ANY bitter flavor, or anything to dissuade you from biting your nails.  This is a very thin product also and does not last long before washing/flaking off.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am trying to stop biting the skin around my finger nails. I rip them apart on a daily basis until I am bleeding. I got this to try to stop and it worked for the first day or so because I was afraid of tasting the stuff. Then I caught a finger in my mouth and... there wasn&#x27;t much of a taste that bothered me. This did NOT work for me. I noticed on another review here someone mentioned some stuff called \\&quot;Mavala Stop\\&quot; and that apparently that worked for them. So I went to that and bought it. As I waited the few days for it to arrive I continued ripping my fingers apart as usual, then it arrived today. I put it on, and within about two hours caught myself licking my finger after eating something delicious. That stuff tastes NASTY!!!!!! I had to run and get orange juice to wash the horrid taste away. I definitely recomment Mavala Stop!!!!  [[ASIN:B0000YUXI0 Mavala Stop, 0.3-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this product for my daughter who has been biting her nails pretty much since birth. She didn&#x27;t even hesitate to continue biting her nails when I put this stuff on her.</li>
            <li> I have not bitten my nails in over 2 weeks and i have been a severe nail bitter my since i can remember. The product did not taste completely horrible which some true nail bitters may be able to ignore but it is a good reminder, which is what has helped me stop. My nails are growing healthy and look great.</li>
            <li> Did help my curtails grow at a healthier rate. my nails were still brittle after week and I kept biting then. it supposedly have a bad taste did not.</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter for years and this product is helping me break this habit.  Every time I put my nail in my mouth I get that bad taste and it helps remind me to not chew on my nails.  I like this product and would recommend it to anyone who has a nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for my 9 year old nail biter or my 4 year old thumb sucker. The 4 year old didn&#x27;t even notice it on his nail. The 9 year old said \\&quot;at first it tastes bad but then you get used to it really quick and it&#x27;s not so bad anymore.\\&quot; I&#x27;ll be spending the money for a better product next time...</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my eight year old daughter who bites her nails.  This did not work at all!  She said she couldn&#x27;t taste anything and it didn&#x27;t prevent her from biting her nails.  This was a complete waste of money.  The \\&quot;Mavala Stop\\&quot; product worked much better.  (A little too well--if she wasn&#x27;t careful she would taste it when she ate food with her hands!)</li>
            <li> I was a little doubtful at first but my first use was as it said. After a few weeks I saw that my nails looked much healthier and my little nail biting habit was no more. I like it and highly recommended this for anyone that has a nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> As my title for this review states, IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR ME!  I am desperately trying to stop biting my finger nails, and this was the first product I tried.  The product description (and statements from other people who liked this product) states that it works wonders and will turn you cold turkey in no time.  It does not have a nasty taste or smell at all, and it comes off your nails easily after a days use.  I tried a different product, \\&quot;Mavala Stop,\\&quot; and it is marvelous, for it does everything that this product doesn&#x27;t.  Mavala Stop is worth the extra three dollars you&#x27;ll spent purchasing it, unlike the Bite Ender, which I want my six dollars back for.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband. He has bitten his nails for about 10+ years. His fingernails were the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen. He has bitten them to were he has bubbles of puss on the ends of his fingers, they bleed, its GROSS. So I found this one day, and we tried it. Followed the directions of applying it twice a week, and it has worked WONDERS !  He worried about it making his fingernails all glossy, it doesn&#x27;t. It isn&#x27;t a polish, its more of a oil. I HIGHLY recommend this product !</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to give it 5 stars yaknow since it tastes awful and all, but yes that is a good quality here, it did its intended job. It&#x27;s a clear nail polish which I didn&#x27;t really expect since I had bought other similar items to fight my habit which were like gels and actually became faint easily, but since it is polish it sticks around and I applied weekly until it was no longer a temptation to nibble my nails, 5 stars for successfully breaking the habit ^o-)b</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing more than clear nail polish, which I could have bought locally for a lot less and not had to pay shipping.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time but the seal on the bottle could have been better.. some of the product had leaked out onto the bottle.. I did use it and it does work.. the taste is enough to remind you not to bite, but not so horrible you want to gag.. lol!  As long as I remember to put it on it works quite well..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has a horrible cuticle biting habit. He said the stuff tasted nasty, and it probably would have done the trick if it didn&#x27;t make his nails bright and shiny. He said there was no way he could attend client meetings with his nails painted, so he picked it all off and refused to let me apply it again.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has been biting her nails for years.  I bought her the bite ender and she has not bitten her nails since.  The only problem, is that I must still remind her to paint it on.  It is working.</li>
            <li> My 6 years old picks this product like it was glue. Create a film around it that with a simple wash gets removed.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This item works very well for stopping biting nails and I am a guy so don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase this product it is like a miracle worker but the person has to be willing to quit becase you apply this bite ender two times a week. I have recommended this product to everyone I know and would recommend it to anyone it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this almost once a week now. It hasn&#x27;t stopped the habit but it helped slow it down. Hoping it&#x27;ll help stop it one day</li>
            <li> I bought this when my 2 year old started biting her nails copying a boy in his class.  In just one week she stopped doing it.  At 5 years old she started again, it has been harder because I have to reapply it every day other wise she stops 3 days and when the polish wears out she starts again.  I will have to see if I donÂ´t forget putting it everyday if it works again, at least I have tasted it and leaves an awful taste in my mouth. My daughter says it tastes nasty as well.&lt;br /&gt;I really would recommend it, if you are consistent in using it, I think it works.</li>
