            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite mascara I have bought.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best mascara which I had, but definitely</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t love this, didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue to use this awesome mascara!</li>
            <li>It is easily to remove mascara</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks fantastic</li>
            <li>and it applies smoothly</li>
            <li>i really like it, its my favorite product:) .</li>
            <li>so I was excited to find this lash boosting version.  </li>
            <li>I used the red kind and it is much better.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara for women with thinning lashes or small lashes!  </li>
            <li>Useful mascara brush</li>
            <li>This came super fast!</li>
            <li>Love L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend, been a loyal product customer for 15+ years</li>
            <li>I love the way that it does not smear and it comes off when you want to take it off, last up to 18 hours.</li>
            <li>You use Hot water to remove, eye make up remover doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>Love the clear side for every day use and the dark side for more dressy events.</li>
            <li>Really gives you volume, makes your lashes look thicker, fuller, darker.</li>
            <li>Better than maybelline, calvin klein, revlon, and tons of other brands i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Usually love this stuff, but this batch seemed a little old or something.</li>
            <li>I live this product.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal user of the regular Double Extend mascara</li>
            <li>The white side really lengthens and thickens my lashes.  </li>
            <li>WOW they all claim to do that</li>
            <li>The other side then really adds the finally pop.  </li>

            <li> it is implied to do and goes on really well, no caking and or build up that  you can see, and my lashes seemed to like the first coat almost like a conditioner base</li>
            <li> I have such small eye lashes!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like heavy eye makeup</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it wand was unable to find it in local cosmetics stores.</li>
            <li> As I aged my eyelashes became thin and there were spaces.</li>
            <li> But it has become difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I hate that Loreal stopped making this product.  </li>

            <li> Love this stuff, can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore!  The white protein extension is the hardest to find. I may use this product and also another lash thickening on top</li>
            <li> I love it. Looks just as good as the $30 mascara my friends have been buying.</li>
            <li> Love the clear side for every day use and the dark side for more dressy events.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and it scored well on EWG&#x27;s website for being fairly safe and non-toxic!</li>
            <li> Great product. My girlfriend loves it wand was unable to find it in local cosmetics stores. Thank you!</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product which gives you both the primer and mascara in one package.  Easy to use and looks fantastic</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Will order always! it actualy, makes my lashes longer. i really like it, its my favorite product:) .</li>
            <li> I hate that Loreal stopped making this product.  I love the way that it does not smear and it comes off when you want to take it off, last up to 18 hours.</li>
            <li> Great stuff I love this mascara it is the best</li>
            <li> This came super fast! I love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The white side really lengthens and thickens my lashes.  The other side then really adds the finally pop.  Definitely my favorite mascara I have bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. won&#x27;t  use anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  really happy with this one. It&#x27;s not the best mascara which I had, but definitely a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It makes my lashes appear longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I like the lash boosting undercoat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Useful mascara brush and it applies smoothly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It is not sticky, not flaky, and not clumpy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) It doesn&#x27;t look like heavy eye makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) It works perfect 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) It is easily to remove mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is great mascara and I love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love this, didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to. I used the red kind and it is much better.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal user of the regular Double Extend mascara so I was excited to find this lash boosting version.  Unfortunately, this product weighs down my lashes to the point that the lashes kind of stick straight our and almost down!  And if I use a lash curler, using this product unfurls the curl!  As an Asian woman, I gotta have me some curled lashes.  So, I would say skip this product and stick to the Double Extend regular.  I do, however, still use the lash boosting at night without the mascara but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> Luv it! Will definitely continue to use this awesome mascara!</li>
            <li> I love every bit of it!  Product and transaction were great!</li>
            <li> This mascara does do just what it is implied to do and goes on really well, no caking and or build up that  you can see, and my lashes seemed to like the first coat almost like a conditioner base it is great. I would say you should give it a try.</li>
            <li> The package was bent up and the black mascara was a bit dry.. but it does the trick. Usually love this stuff, but this batch seemed a little old or something.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed I ordered two and they came with an open package...Just threw them away. Should have asked for a refund</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not water proof, but it doesn&#x27;t run. its amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use another mascara brand!</li>
            <li> Actually does what it promises to do - makes your lashes thicker and longer !  WOW they all claim to do that but this one actually delivers!  Just make sure you READ HOW TO REMOVE IT !  You use Hot water to remove, eye make up remover doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Extends Lashes to the fullest! Love love love! It worked wonders for me bc I have such small eye lashes!</li>
            <li> Its okay would have liked some thing heaver.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara for women with thinning lashes or small lashes!  But it has become difficult to find.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.As I aged my eyelashes became thin and there were spaces.After using this product for only a week,I see improvement .This is now my permanent mascara.In spite of the snowy winter here,it came on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara. Better than maybelline, calvin klein, revlon, and tons of other brands i&#x27;ve tried. Really gives you volume, makes your lashes look thicker, fuller, darker.</li>
            <li> Love L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend, been a loyal product customer for 15+ years</li>
            <li> I live this product. I don&#x27;t understand why they discontinued it.</li>
