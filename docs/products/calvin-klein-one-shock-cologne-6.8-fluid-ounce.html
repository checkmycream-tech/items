            <li>THIS smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>Good smelling.  </li>
            <li>but it is still good</li>
            <li>my husband was very pleased.</li>
            <li>It did this on its own....</li>
            <li>This stuff is really nice.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, it is nice and smell so good, i will bout more of this,</li>
            <li>Great Product but nothing beats the original CK</li>
            <li>Do the math, it&#x27;s a much better value than purchasing this product retail.  </li>
            <li>I had run out and wanted some more.  </li>
            <li>I love its smell</li>
            <li>The bottle was indeed the 200 ml size as described and definitely authentic.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to smell the same.but</li>
            <li>it has a very unique one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More importantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, and it lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>It came as a gift set where the shower gel was included, an unexpected and pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no connoisseur of fragrances, so I&#x27;ll spare everyone my impression of the scents in this cologne, and just say that it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>price was great and came when expected.</li>
            <li>The perfume is good, the fragance is a little too strong for what we expect</li>
            <li>When it dries I pickup a very pleasant and subtle tobacco note and a touch of sweetness.</li>
            <li>I was asked to find a signature scent for a friend and tested many different men&#x27;s fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first ordering this cologne.</li>
            <li>It certainly draws the attention of the ladies.</li>
            <li>It seems to be the real thing</li>
            <li>The way women react to this smell reminds me a lot of the AXE commericals, but for real.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a little more musky</li>
            <li>This is a year round scent deep and rich in winter, but somehow light in summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased about every new cologne for men as they are released.  </li>
            <li>We have been together for 9 years and are set to be married very shortly.</li>
            <li>Also in the package was a 100ml tube of shower gel, I&#x27;m not sure why, but I won&#x27;t complain about a free gift.</li>
            <li>My bottle was only seven days old when it destroyed itself.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Its sultry, thick, sweet and musky.</li>
            <li>Shock is hands down my favorite and the only one I&#x27;ve worn for the past two years.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Do the math, it&#x27;s a much better value than purchasing this product retail.  It seems to be the real thing and I would recommend this product to anyone that likes the CK one fragrance line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no connoisseur of fragrances, so I&#x27;ll spare everyone my impression of the scents in this cologne, and just say that it smells fantastic. It&#x27;s the only cologne I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a disaster waiting to happen. Stored on a flat surface with space surrounding it, this bottle managed to creep over tithe edge of the vanity and fell to the tiled floor where it shattered spreading glass shards all over the floor.... More importantly. It did this on its own....no one was around. I feel cheated and misused by the seller, the designer and the. manufacturer. A friend had the same thing happen...without human intervention. My bottle was only seven days old when it destroyed itself.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bottle was only half filled when it arrived; pretty misleading for an expensive purchase. NEVER AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Good smelling.  My daughter had bought me this for fathers day long time ago.  I had run out and wanted some more.  Found it on Amazon. Great service and delivery from supplier. Thanx</li>
            <li> I love its smell it has a very unique one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that it does not last for too long.</li>
            <li> Great Product but nothing beats the original CK One&lt;br /&gt;This is a little more musky that&#x27;s all&lt;br /&gt;Great buy though</li>
            <li> This stuff is really nice.  My wife loves it, and she enjoys when I wear it.  It&#x27;s not too strong, and it lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> tiene un aroma espectacular</li>
            <li> I like this product, it is nice and smell so good, i will bout more of this, cause i like it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance. We have been together for 9 years and are set to be married very shortly. We have been searching for YEARS for a cologne that worked for him, and this is it! Its sultry, thick, sweet and musky.</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne for the money. When it dries I pickup a very pleasant and subtle tobacco note and a touch of sweetness. (my nose is not very sophisticated) The bottle was indeed the 200 ml size as described and definitely authentic. Also in the package was a 100ml tube of shower gel, I&#x27;m not sure why, but I won&#x27;t complain about a free gift.</li>
            <li> I was asked to find a signature scent for a friend and tested many different men&#x27;s fragrances.  Finally chose this one and love the scent, although the packaging is stupid.  Hey, you can&#x27;t have everything!</li>
            <li> The volume is actually 6.7 fl oz. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s a legitimate product. It came as a gift set where the shower gel was included, an unexpected and pleasant surprise. It&#x27;s a great cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased about every new cologne for men as they are released.  Shock is hands down my favorite and the only one I&#x27;ve worn for the past two years.  This is a year round scent deep and rich in winter, but somehow light in summer. Women, men and children have complimented  me while wearing Shock. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Mmmmmmmm, not my tipe</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a smell for the longest time but couldn&#x27;t find one that was me. This however is perfect. I will probably never wear anything else. The way women react to this smell reminds me a lot of the AXE commericals, but for real.</li>
            <li> The perfume is good, the fragance is a little too strong for what we expect but it is still good</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first ordering this cologne. wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to smell the same.but it did. price was great and came when expected. my husband was very pleased.</li>
            <li> This item speaks for itself. Whenever I wear this cologne, I have the ladies clinging to me like leaches. ,</li>
            <li> THIS smells amazing!  When I wear this out I get stopped constantly.  It certainly draws the attention of the ladies.</li>
            <li> this product say that the bottle has 200 ml of perfume, but when i receive it, it contained a bottle of 100 ml perfume and a gel shower. i pay for a bottle of 200 ml not a bottle of 100 ml and a gel that i hate it.</li>
