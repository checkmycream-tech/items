            <li>all and all this is a great wig</li>
            <li>Great for the price.</li>
            <li>Great price for a good looking wig.</li>
            <li>The wig looks good</li>
            <li>the color is very cute and the bangs already suited my face.</li>
            <li>Love that!</li>
            <li>Good quality and very cheap.</li>
            <li>but for the price, it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
            <li>onto the wig itself, it was in great shape, fabulous quality and was just lovely.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t the most realistic looking wig and not one of the best I own.</li>
            <li>ends split very easily as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not itchy, and very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I was wanting to get a nice wig for Halloween and this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>ok i&#x27;m going start with the cons....</li>
            <li>so it kinda has the more fakeish kinda look.</li>
            <li>it looked a bit more thinker as well.</li>
            <li>It was just a color I thought was absolutely lovely for hair.</li>
            <li>When you receive the products, please check to see it has the authentic X&amp;Y brand.</li>
            <li>I would love to hear what you think about the brand issue from any customer.</li>
            <li>Thank you. :)</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase, especially for this price.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels and it is not too shiny.</li>
            <li>and it had cute instructions too.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier. :)</li>
            <li>It arrived the first of August!!!</li>
            <li>Upon taking it out of the package, I was stunned by how beautiful and soft the wig was.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s still pretty good quality over all.</li>
            <li>But it looks authentic and has a beautiful red tint.</li>
            <li>The fibers are soft and natural, the perfect amount of wavy curly and overall is a wonderful wig!</li>
            <li>I got this wig (dark brown) in 5 days perfectly in time for y flight to Seattle, and it came in with a wig cap (THAT came with a cute cartoon tutorial on how to use it, too, awwh) which I was super pleased to get.</li>
            <li>Although it does tangle easily I have found a method to detangle it and can comb it easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer serves was very quick and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig is a lot lighter (light brown) than it is shown in the photo.</li>
            <li>Originally when I had planned to buy the wig, I had decided to get the light brown.</li>
            <li>I love this wig very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite doing this, I&#x27;m still leaving my original review</li>
            <li>It may not exactly be my color, but it still looks and feels beautiful nonetheless.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s as full as the #1.</li>
            <li>However, based on the wig itself and not my expectations, it&#x27;s a really nice wig and looks pretty realistic when worn.</li>
            <li>Other then that it is a great day to day wig.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great</li>
            <li>I took it out of the package and luckily it came with a wig cap</li>
            <li>This wig is a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>When it first arrived i was so excited once i received my package.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase from X&amp;Y Angel and I am pleased!</li>
            <li>:) The color has a hint of red which is fine.</li>
            <li>It looks natural :)</li>
            <li>The color and length are pretty cool.</li>
            <li>unlike most cheaper wigs, the hair hasn&#x27;t really fallen out much when combed or when you run your fingers through it.</li>
            <li>Love the color and it can look natural if you wear it right.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t as good as their other products that they show.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s very soft, doesn&#x27;t tangle and is easy to brush.</li>
            <li>It is soft and easy to brush out.</li>
            <li>The price of the wig is very reasonable and affordable.</li>
            <li>so pretty.</li>
            <li>but I will most likely use this in my school photos tomorrow!</li>
            <li>People always think it&#x27;s my real hair, even when they touch it!</li>
            <li>Two Tone Short Straight BOB Stylish Kanekalon Highlight Wig&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always wear my hair up in a bun n on the day i wore this wig people thought it was my real hair</li>
            <li>Thank you so much augh &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Though the wig does go very well with my complexion even though it&#x27;s not wig I wanted.</li>
            <li>but you have to be really gentle with it.</li>
            <li>I bought this just for fun and the hair is super long, comes almost to my waist.</li>
            <li>n said I should wear it down more often Thanks  Bacardi</li>
            <li>the hair is very soft and silky and the waves are lovely, though it isn&#x27;t as thick and full as I wish it was.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t shiny enough to look fake, but shiny enough to look like healthy, beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I love this wig.</li>
            <li>Long like the picture and very pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit overwhelming for any casual wear, but definitely for a special occasion or for fun photos.</li>
            <li>It is very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I like it or love it.</li>
            <li>I know this smell from my grandparents basement that I was in frequently as a child digging through things and the smell is not hard for me to place.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and much easier to run your fingers through it compared to a synthetic I bought not long ago.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and feels natural.</li>
            <li>A rich dark chocolate brown</li>
            <li>Fits really well and has bands within to adjust for smaller heads if needed.</li>
            <li>but it is soft.</li>
            <li>and it looks really natural.</li>
            <li>It is kind of thin</li>
            <li>Looks pretty much like the picture, maybe a slightly tighter curl.</li>
            <li>I was trying to go for 3 different looks and this is super long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The is not nearly as long, it&#x27;s a light brown instead of a dark brown,&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, feels like regular hair, and is very thick.</li>
            <li>New Kanekalon Short BOB Style Wavy Heat Resistant Kanekalon Hair Wig</li>
            <li>, while the wig doesn&#x27;t tangle easily, it had at least a fingers width of hair knotted (before I even took it out the bag)</li>
            <li>I got this wig today, and it came very early and took only 8 days to get it</li>
            <li>but i kinda expected that, also it looks really shinny</li>
            <li>: Oh by the way, I did order this through Surewells unaware that it wasn&#x27;t directly from X&amp;Y Angel.</li>
            <li>it tangles very easy and is difficult to brush.</li>
            <li>The wig is very soft and flowy it&#x27;s not too full and not too thin</li>
            <li>This wig, although cheap, does not look shoddy!</li>

            <li> This wig, although cheap, does not look shoddy!</li>
            <li> The bangs are long enough if you want to cut them yourself or sweep them off to the side.</li>
            <li> New Fashion Ladies&#x27; Fluffy Personality Kanekalon Long Wavy Human Hair Wig</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it is sooooo long!</li>
            <li> but I had to cut it to make the bangs stay out of my eyes because the we&#x27;re so long and just refused to part</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really considering cutting it because I don&#x27;t really want it that long.</li>
            <li> so I got the dark brown, only for them to restock about a week</li>
            <li> The actual color of the dark brown wig is between a #2 - #4.</li>
            <li> I will say though that is is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> All things to be expected of a wig at this length for this price.</li>
            <li> A little curlier than what is shown, but I will remedy this with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> i check out other products and the netting</li>
            <li> so other customers know</li>
            <li> i got the dark brown</li>
            <li> The color I got is a dark chestnut brown.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it was a little too shiny, but a few sprays of dry shampoo took care of that issue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the color of the wig is such a dark brown that it&#x27;s almost #1 black; a color that is very different from the pictures.</li>
            <li> I ordered my wig in the color dark brown, and received it in neat packaging approximately 4 weeks later.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and long.</li>
            <li> And this was just unbelievable to find on a wig!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> Also it isn&#x27;t as thick as i thought it was gong to be</li>
            <li> Well made, not too heavy or thin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a decently thick amount of hair.</li>
            <li> This was beyond ridiculous!</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never have I ever been so disgusted!</li>

Pro&#x27;s The colour is great i got the dark brown the cut AMAZING!! once i brushed it out it got a bit it looked a bit more thinker as well. i will have to see if i can wash out some of the shininess all and all this is a great wig and i&#x27;m NOT regretting paying for it. I&#x27;m still very happy with this product!!!.</li>
            <li> I bought this just for fun and the hair is super long, comes almost to my waist. Love the color and it can look natural if you wear it right. It&#x27;s a bit overwhelming for any casual wear, but definitely for a special occasion or for fun photos.</li>
            <li> Originally when I had planned to buy the wig, I had decided to get the light brown. It was just a color I thought was absolutely lovely for hair. I thought they had run out and didn&#x27;t plan on selling anymore so I got the dark brown, only for them to restock about a week later.&lt;br /&gt;But onto the wig itself, it was in great shape, fabulous quality and was just lovely. I would and plan to buy from their seller again. It looks natural :)</li>
            <li> The wig is not 100% like the wig shown on the model photo.&lt;br /&gt;The is not nearly as long, it&#x27;s a light brown instead of a dark brown,&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s not human hair. Though the wig does go very well with my complexion even though it&#x27;s not wig I wanted. It is soft and easy to brush out.</li>
            <li> Good quality and very cheap. The color and length are pretty cool. You can use it longer than you expect.</li>
            <li> I love this wig very much. I received the hair color that I wanted. It is very soft. Although it does tangle easily I have found a method to detangle it and can comb it easily. My only concern is that it did not come with the X&amp;Y brand. They say on the product info, \\&quot; When you receive the products, please check to see it has the authentic X&amp;Y brand. If not, please ask for a refund.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if I should ask for a refund, or not worry about it??? I would love to hear what you think about the brand issue from any customer. Thank you. :)&lt;br /&gt;Note: Oh by the way, I did order this through Surewells unaware that it wasn&#x27;t directly from X&amp;Y Angel. &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Well made, not too heavy or thin. Very happy with this purchase, especially for this price. Fits really well and has bands within to adjust for smaller heads if needed.</li>
            <li> A very beautiful wig. It is very thick and long. My only complaint is that it was a little too shiny, but a few sprays of dry shampoo took care of that issue.</li>
            <li> I was wanting to get a nice wig for Halloween and this one is pretty good. It is kind of thin but it will work. :) The color has a hint of red which is fine. Great price for a good looking wig. I will definitely be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig around mid July. It said it would arrive around the beginning of September. It arrived the first of August!!! Love that! This wig is a very pretty color. A rich dark chocolate brown so pretty. I love the way it feels and it is not too shiny. I will say though that is is pretty thin. I may need to buy hair extensions this color and add them to the wig. Other then that it is a great day to day wig.</li>
            <li> I ordered my wig in the color dark brown, and received it in neat packaging approximately 4 weeks later. Upon taking it out of the package, I was stunned by how beautiful and soft the wig was. Unfortunately the color of the wig is such a dark brown that it&#x27;s almost #1 black; a color that is very different from the pictures. It may not exactly be my color, but it still looks and feels beautiful nonetheless. The actual color of the dark brown wig is between a #2 - #4.</li>
            <li> The wig looks good but I had to cut it to make the bangs stay out of my eyes because the we&#x27;re so long and just refused to part</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t the most realistic looking wig and not one of the best I own. but for the price, it&#x27;s quite nice. the hair is very soft and silky and the waves are lovely, though it isn&#x27;t as thick and full as I wish it was. unlike most cheaper wigs, the hair hasn&#x27;t really fallen out much when combed or when you run your fingers through it. so it&#x27;s still pretty good quality over all.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. No shedding issues and it&#x27;s a decently thick amount of hair. Looks pretty much like the picture, maybe a slightly tighter curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright wig. The wig is a lot lighter (light brown) than it is shown in the photo. The curls and bangs are different, even. However, based on the wig itself and not my expectations, it&#x27;s a really nice wig and looks pretty realistic when worn.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig but you have to be really gentle with it. it tangles very easy and is difficult to brush. ends split very easily as well. All things to be expected of a wig at this length for this price. But it looks authentic and has a beautiful red tint.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 11-22:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since giving my feedback on the company/seller themselves I have since gotten refunded the total including shipping. They didn&#x27;t ask I return it.&lt;br /&gt;Customer serves was very quick and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite doing this, I&#x27;m still leaving my original review below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say so other customers know I got this wig through SureWells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that, that&#x27;s been said....&lt;br /&gt;THE WIG SMELLED LIKE MOLD!!!!!!!! WTF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never have I ever been so disgusted! Who keeps wigs in a moldy container or warehouse and then has the nerve so sell this s***!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I gave it 2 stars I only did so because it&#x27;s very soft, doesn&#x27;t tangle and is easy to brush. Those are the only reasons.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I took it out of the bag I could smell the musk/mill-dew. I know this smell from my grandparents basement that I was in frequently as a child digging through things and the smell is not hard for me to place. And this was just unbelievable to find on a wig!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, while the wig doesn&#x27;t tangle easily, it had at least a fingers width of hair knotted (before I even took it out the bag) that I had to sit here for an hour and try and unknot it to the point that I then had to cut off the bits that I couldn&#x27;t get unknotted. This was beyond ridiculous! I haven&#x27;t even tried it on yet because the smell is too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the mold smell I have sprayed it with my Aussie stay in conditioner twice, but I fear I&#x27;m going to have to buy wig shampoo and wash it just to get the stench out! This wig comes from China and while it only cost me $13 bucks in total I&#x27;m not about to pay out of pocket just to ship it back. What a waste!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 hair pieces to wear while going through chemo.&lt;br /&gt;1. 2013 Two Tone Short Straight BOB Stylish Kanekalon Highlight Wig&lt;br /&gt;2. 2013 New Kanekalon Short BOB Style Wavy Heat Resistant Kanekalon Hair Wig&lt;br /&gt;3. New Fashion Ladies&#x27; Fluffy Personality Kanekalon Long Wavy Human Hair Wig&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like #3. I was trying to go for 3 different looks and this is super long. I&#x27;m not sure if I like it or love it. I think I&#x27;m just not used to the length but it is soft. I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s as full as the #1.</li>
            <li> I got this wig today, and it came very early and took only 8 days to get it so already that was awesome! I took it out of the package and luckily it came with a wig cap so yay and it had cute instructions too. The wig is very soft and flowy it&#x27;s not too full and not too thin and it looks really natural. I didn&#x27;t have to adjust because when I put it on it was already perfect! The only thing is that it is sooooo long! I&#x27;m really considering cutting it because I don&#x27;t really want it that long. Other than that it is great the color is very cute and the bangs already suited my face. I haven&#x27;t tried to straighten it yet but I will most likely use this in my school photos tomorrow! Really happy!</li>
            <li> Long like the picture and very pretty. A little curlier than what is shown, but I will remedy this with a flat iron. This is my second purchase from X&amp;Y Angel and I am pleased!</li>
            <li> So, I fried my hair and got a very short hair cut. Not flattering at all. So, of course I decided to buy a wig. The price of the wig is very reasonable and affordable. I love it. I ordered it on December 9th and received it December 26th. It is very soft and much easier to run your fingers through it compared to a synthetic I bought not long ago. It looks very natural and feels natural. It&#x27;s not itchy, and very comfortable to wear. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. :)</li>
            <li> This wig, although cheap, does not look shoddy! It&#x27;s amazing, feels like regular hair, and is very thick. People always think it&#x27;s my real hair, even when they touch it! It isn&#x27;t shiny enough to look fake, but shiny enough to look like healthy, beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> For the price, this wig is great! I wanted to try out a different hairstyle without the commitment of permanent dye. The color I got is a dark chestnut brown. The bangs are long enough if you want to cut them yourself or sweep them off to the side.</li>
