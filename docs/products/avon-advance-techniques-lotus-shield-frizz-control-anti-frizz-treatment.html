    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For me, this product is the best anti-friz formula I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using this product for a month before finishing my review to check for consistency in the results and I&#x27;m still very impressed.     </li>
            <li>Best anti frizz</li>
            <li>This product is awesome!  </li>
            <li>The shine and texture are superb and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Although it has a very pleasant smell</li>
            <li>Good and excellent item.</li>
            <li>this product works great.</li>
            <li>Product smells and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>Then when I wanted to I couldn&#x27;t find it again and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product and it smells great too.  </li>
            <li>It works a bit better if you do blow-dry.    </li>
            <li>By the end of the day there was more frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I better stock up.</li>
            <li>Mousse seems to help more than this.</li>
            <li>...I find a product I love</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>Okay?  </li>
            <li>it helps keep the stray fly aways in, gives my hair a more polished look, and has a decent smell to it which fades after putting in on your hair.</li>
            <li>We chose this one and it seemed to work pretty good.  </li>
            <li>and my hair looks and feels frizz free and healthy.  </li>
            <li>My shampoo and conditioner are good, but my hair was still noticeably easier to manage then normal.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair sooooo soft and static free, smells good too.  </li>
            <li>The results have proven it and my hair still remains silky smooth and frizz free a week after using.</li>
            <li>I can blow-dry and flat-iron my hair where it looks totally straight and nice</li>
            <li>Hair is not frizzy, but smooth the ends.</li>
            <li>i can go a day between washes and it still stays smooth.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product for my curly haired daughter.  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered this from Avon online.  </li>
            <li>It is more effective than many other over the counter anti frizz products.</li>
            <li>It may work better on straight hair.</li>
            <li>hands aren&#x27;t left with a greasy film after applying the product, which is a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She happened to be an Avon representative and gave me a sample of this product, telling me how much her customers love it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t use too much though</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work but after trying it I am convinced it is the new miracle product to control frizz!</li>
            <li>It works likes many other products of this kind.</li>
            <li>My hair is almost 100% frizz free, feels very silky, doesn&#x27;t look lank or greasy, didn&#x27;t tangle overnight</li>
            <li>Who would have thought that Avon sold such an amazing hair product.</li>
            <li>serum is clear and has a lotus fragrance - lovely and fresh</li>
            <li>A pearl size drop tossed in freshly shampooed hair</li>
            <li>This product is well reviewed on other sites and most people think it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I thought that I would try it on my hair first.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should purchase this since there seemed to be mixed reviews on it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Three washes: I gave it another day serum-free at first to see if there was any any improvement.</li>
            <li>This helps keep it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked for sure, wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty frizzy, and this doesn&#x27;t help it at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I used more than 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon on my long hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product - does take away the frizz and allows for a smooth looking finish after blow drying; sticky residue on hands is difficult to remove; requires extra shampoo to remove residue from hair as well;</li>
            <li>Now, having said that, you should know that my hair is naturally wavy and can be blown smooth in wintertime with a palm full of mousse which is very tacky the next day.  </li>
            <li>My guess about another reviewer&#x27;s claim that it made her hair sticky is that she used way too much.</li>
            <li>My hair still remained almost entirely frizz free and silky after being thoroughly washed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using this product for a month before finishing my review to check for consistency in the results and I&#x27;m still very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied it mostly to my ends and combed it through with a wide tooth comb and the frizz was gone.  </li>
            <li>She had a similar product but no longer available.</li>
            <li>or your hair may make your hair dirty-looking before you&#x27;re ready to wash it.  </li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d be heavy and leave a residue that would build up, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>My hair still looked as clean as it did on the day I washed it, every day between it&#x27;s last wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gives my hair volume ad body, I&#x27;ve used this tuff for years and it has never let me down:)</li>
            <li>When I first read that it will last for up to two washes I thought it&#x27;d be heavy and leave a residue that would build up, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Avon say that their new Advance Techniques anti-frizz serum LOTUS SHIELD forms a protective lightweight barrier on hair that is capable of holding up in up to 97% humidity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Two washes: The ends of my hair were frizzy after styling - not as much as normal though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what it did to my hair to tell you the truth, but it didn&#x27;t make it feel frizz free, repaired, or shielded.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Avon product I&#x27;ve owned that has delivered the same results as promised.</li>
            <li>I first read that it will last for up to two washes</li>
            <li>I think it may have helped minimally, but I really didn&#x27;t notice a large difference.  </li>
            <li>My naturally wavy and frizzy hair has been tamed.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and have used this product over the years.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This helps tame my hair and has even held up and kept it fairly smooth and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and fine, not much body</li>
            <li>This really helped my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I now use Moroccanoil on a daily basis and WOW what a difference it has made.  </li>
            <li>I am a 70 something woman with naturally curly hair which I wear very long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The real difference between this and other serums is how Avon claims that the results last through two washes, so this only needs applying every third wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I will purchase this again and recommend it to my other \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; friends.</li>
            <li> if i dont wash my hair for a day it doesnt make it greasy like other products</li>
            <li> - that is hard to distinguish once the product has been applied, apart from the occasional whiff when my hair blows into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Frizz control effects, at least for me, do not last longer than a day.</li>
            <li> It helps \\&quot;calm\\&quot; my hair, which is extremely frizzy and lives in an odd place between wavy and curly (i.e. my hair needs help!).  </li>
            <li> It made my hair a sticky, gooey mess.  </li>
            <li> usually wash my hair every other day, but have been leaving it for two to three days as I thought the serum would make my hair mega greasy and heavy, so I wanted to see the results.</li>
            <li> (yes, I know blowdrying daily is not great...).  </li>
            <li> When I apply Avon Advance, I use a very small amount - the size of a dime in the palm of my hand - and I apply it to my hair while it is wet.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and when i put this it just weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy like others I have tried, you need very little</li>
            <li> That has happened to me in the past with shampoo and conditioning products.</li>
            <li> I used as directed but had no better results than I get with my usual conditioner by itself.</li>
            <li> It smells unbelievable also.  </li>
            <li> It does wonders on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not help me at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I was doing wrong.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so bad for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed....</li>
            <li> Just awful!</li>
            <li> Thi stuff is a God Send for Thin Hair!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product smells and feels nice.  It does nothing for controlling frizz if you don&#x27;t blow-dry your hair.  It works a bit better if you do blow-dry.    I originally purchased this product for my curly haired daughter.  I thought that I would try it on my hair first. It doesn&#x27;t work.  I am quite disappointed....because after reading reviews an the Avon website, I thought it was the frizz solution to my daughters hair issues.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work but after trying it I am convinced it is the new miracle product to control frizz! The results have proven it and my hair still remains silky smooth and frizz free a week after using. My naturally wavy and frizzy hair has been tamed. I definitely recommend this product and give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should purchase this since there seemed to be mixed reviews on it.  My suggestion is this.  Buy it and try it.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and while one person may swear by a product, it may not work on another.  For me, this product is the best anti-friz formula I have ever purchased.  I have wavy-kinky hair.  I can blow-dry and flat-iron my hair where it looks totally straight and nice but once I hit any type of humidity my hair literally grows sideways into a Brillo Pad!  When I apply Avon Advance, I use a very small amount - the size of a dime in the palm of my hand - and I apply it to my hair while it is wet.  My guess about another reviewer&#x27;s claim that it made her hair sticky is that she used way too much. My only concern with this product is if I use it too often, my hair may get too used to it and it may stop working so well. That has happened to me in the past with shampoo and conditioning products.</li>
            <li> It works likes many other products of this kind. This is no surprise if you read the ingredients list. Frizz control effects, at least for me, do not last longer than a day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not help me at all. I am a 70 something woman with naturally curly hair which I wear very long. I had hoped Avon Frizz Control would do away with the frizzy, untamed look but I saw no difference after using it. It may work better on straight hair. I used as directed but had no better results than I get with my usual conditioner by itself. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Avon say that their new Advance Techniques anti-frizz serum LOTUS SHIELD forms a protective lightweight barrier on hair that is capable of holding up in up to 97% humidity.&lt;br /&gt;The real difference between this and other serums is how Avon claims that the results last through two washes, so this only needs applying every third wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is clear and has a lotus fragrance - lovely and fresh - that is hard to distinguish once the product has been applied, apart from the occasional whiff when my hair blows into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands aren&#x27;t left with a greasy film after applying the product, which is a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No washes: I was stunned. This is the first Avon product I&#x27;ve owned that has delivered the same results as promised. My hair is almost 100% frizz free, feels very silky, doesn&#x27;t look lank or greasy, didn&#x27;t tangle overnight [I was ill and spent 12 hours in bed tossing and turning] and feels even more lightweight than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if the results don&#x27;t last after my hair has been washed I&#x27;ll still re-buy LOTUS SHEILD as I&#x27;ve never used a serum that has worked so well on my hair before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One wash: I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My hair still remained almost entirely frizz free and silky after being thoroughly washed. My shampoo and conditioner are good, but my hair was still noticeably easier to manage then normal. It still seemed easier to detangle as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my hair every other day, but have been leaving it for two to three days as I thought the serum would make my hair mega greasy and heavy, so I wanted to see the results. My hair still looked as clean as it did on the day I washed it, every day between it&#x27;s last wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two washes: The ends of my hair were frizzy after styling - not as much as normal though. By the end of the day there was more frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three washes: I gave it another day serum-free at first to see if there was any any improvement. My hair looked and felt the same as it did before I started to use LOTUS SHIELD. Verdict? Avon has delivered on their promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avon have always been a hit or miss brand with me and I don&#x27;t like any of their Advance Techniques range, so I&#x27;ve now been using this product for a month before finishing my review to check for consistency in the results and I&#x27;m still very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve mentioned this in other haircare reviews; I&#x27;m in the process of growing out a disastrous perm, so I&#x27;m suffering from more then my regular frizziness - I&#x27;ve got fried hair and look like I&#x27;ve been sticking my finger into electrical sockets. If something is capable of taming the artificial, chemically imposed mess on my head, imagine the results it will give to natural frizz?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first read that it will last for up to two washes I thought it&#x27;d be heavy and leave a residue that would build up, but so far so good. The only thing I&#x27;d caution you with is that the second wash results can vary slightly. It&#x27;s always given me less frizz then usual, but there is some the majority of the time, whilst other times it can remain frizz free.TUS SHIELD. Verdict?

            <li> I was standing in line at the grocery store and started talking with the woman in front of me in line.  She happened to be an Avon representative and gave me a sample of this product, telling me how much her customers love it.  I have dry hair in the summer and deal with a lot of \\&quot;frizz\\&quot;. My hair is long and fine, not much body so when it frizzes out my hair looks \\&quot;burnt\\&quot;.  So I tried the little sample and WOW! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product and it smells great too.  Not greasy like others I have tried, you need very little and it goes a long way.  I applied it mostly to my ends and combed it through with a wide tooth comb and the frizz was gone.  It also lasted a couple of days, and my hair just looked shiny and healthier.  I could not be more pleased. I will purchase this again and recommend it to my other \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; friends.</li>
            <li> Good and excellent item. Hair is not frizzy, but smooth the ends.</li>
            <li> Best anti frizz I have found on the market.  I have course hair and it frizzes in the humidity.  This helps keep it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  Makes my hair sooooo soft and static free, smells good too.  I&#x27;m hooked for sure, wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry curly hair.  She adores this product, says it helps a lot with her frizz problems.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - does take away the frizz and allows for a smooth looking finish after blow drying; sticky residue on hands is difficult to remove; requires extra shampoo to remove residue from hair as well;</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have used this product over the years. It is more effective than many other over the counter anti frizz products. But it looks like Avon has discontinued the product. I better stock up.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that Avon sold such an amazing hair product. I never knew! I&#x27;ll keep buying this stuff. It does wonders on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product is well reviewed on other sites and most people think it is fantastic.  I just can&#x27;t imagine what they are thinking!  It made my hair a sticky, gooey mess.  I don&#x27;t think I used more than 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon on my long hair.  Don&#x27;t know what I was doing wrong.  Just awful!</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different hair products to try to combat my colored/dry/fine/curly hair.  I thought that I would see a noticable difference with this one, but I did not.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly what it did to my hair to tell you the truth, but it didn&#x27;t make it feel frizz free, repaired, or shielded.  I think it may have helped minimally, but I really didn&#x27;t notice a large difference.  I now use Moroccanoil on a daily basis and WOW what a difference it has made.  I use it both when wet and dry and my hair looks and feels frizz free and healthy.  It smells unbelievable also.  I believe it is wiser to spend the money on the Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty frizzy, and this doesn&#x27;t help it at all. Mousse seems to help more than this. Although it has a very pleasant smell</li>
            <li> Thi stuff is a God Send for Thin Hair!!!!! It&#x27;s gives my hair volume ad body, I&#x27;ve used this tuff for years and it has never let me down:)</li>
            <li> this product works great. i only use about a nickle size for long hair (past the rib cage). it helps keep the stray fly aways in, gives my hair a more polished look, and has a decent smell to it which fades after putting in on your hair. if i dont wash my hair for a day it doesnt make it greasy like other products do so i can go a day between washes and it still stays smooth.</li>
            <li> She had a similar product but no longer available. We chose this one and it seemed to work pretty good.  Will probably continue with this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This really helped my dry hair.  I like to use it as my short hair gets longer.  It makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> ...I find a product I love and then it&#x27;s gone.  I originally ordered this from Avon online.  Then when I wanted to I couldn&#x27;t find it again and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  I love, love, love this product.  A pearl size drop tossed in freshly shampooed hair and I&#x27;m frizz-less until my next shampoo.  For me it&#x27;s miraculous especially in summertime humidity.  The shine and texture are superb and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  Make sure you don&#x27;t use too much though or your hair may make your hair dirty-looking before you&#x27;re ready to wash it.  IIt helped me go from layers to all one length without a lot of fly-aways.  Now, having said that, you should know that my hair is naturally wavy and can be blown smooth in wintertime with a palm full of mousse which is very tacky the next day.  I don&#x27;t have natural tight curls not am I a woman of color.  I just have frizz.  It is not a straightener.  Okay?  That&#x27;s all folks.</li>
            <li> So I bought this online b/c it was a lot cheaper than buying from avon catalog (shipping included) and it&#x27;s so bad for my hair.  I have thick hair and when i put this it just weighs my hair down.  It&#x27;s like putting baby oil in my hair, GROSS!!!</li>
            <li> Use it every day when I blowdry (yes, I know blowdrying daily is not great...).  It helps \\&quot;calm\\&quot; my hair, which is extremely frizzy and lives in an odd place between wavy and curly (i.e. my hair needs help!).  This helps tame my hair and has even held up and kept it fairly smooth and frizz-free.</li>
