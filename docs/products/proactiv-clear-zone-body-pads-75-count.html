    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is perfect for oily and combination oily skin (on the face) because pads are soaked with salicylic acid that prevents acne and helps control oil production.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect after bikini / brazilian waxing (shaving).  </li>
            <li>Great product that works!</li>
            <li>From experience I&#x27;ve found salicyclic Acid is one of the best acid to help rapidly rid oneself of blemishes/pimples.</li>
            <li>These pads are perfect.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful body pads that one can use on both face and body.  </li>
            <li>These pads work great for that.</li>
            <li>These have worked great for us on body acne.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say they are pleasant to use -</li>
            <li>ProActiv makes a good product</li>
            <li>They may be a good product but they are just not for me.</li>
            <li>, life could be good.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the skin and has a soothing effect.</li>
            <li>you can afford it, it&#x27;s a good solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good results with Salicylic Acid -</li>
            <li>These are perfect to use just after a shower and right before applying a self tanner.</li>
            <li>The good news is that this product is very strong.</li>
            <li>Amazing  </li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t found one</li>
            <li>They are a nice size and can be tucked in your purse for use at work or school.  </li>
            <li>kind of jumbo pads...saturated with a blemish fighter as well as an exfoliater.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for getting ready for summer.</li>
            <li>These pads do a nice job of de-greasing my skin.</li>
            <li>This gives you 150 pads, so it&#x27;s more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I have used so many products that don&#x27;t do anything at all</li>
            <li>They are more than twice the size of Stridex pads.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s potent stuff and one must use with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefore, it costs more than it should.</li>
            <li>Even more so with compression clothing, where moisture wicking tendsto trap oils/dirt beneath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More sweat...more sting.</li>
            <li>These work better on cleaner</li>
            <li>These are pretty good pads to use on your body.</li>
            <li>Boy, do they clean!</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done with it, I think I will have a more accurate review of the product.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness so far.</li>
            <li>Since they have worked for us and the price is reasonable compared to the good results we have had, I give 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Note though, they do stick together rather easily</li>
            <li>Easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Proactiv makes such great products.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for back, arm, and chest breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Lightly scented and functional.  </li>
            <li>these pads work great for chest and back</li>
            <li>I used these pads on my lower back and noticed great improvement after about a week.</li>
            <li>I generally have good results using salicylic acid based products on my face, but these pads don&#x27;t work well on my body.</li>
            <li>These pads are body pads and are a good large size, they work really well</li>
            <li>They clean</li>
            <li>pads have a rough texture that does a fairly good job of exfoliating the skin and removing dirt from the top of the pores.</li>
            <li>She wants more when this supply runs out</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.  </li>
            <li>Lots of time in the sun causes my nose to get oily, and a quick wipe with these helps control breakouts.  </li>
            <li>But the strong burning feel is a bit too much, and so I deducted one star because of that.</li>
            <li>These are great, extra-large size pads that really do clear up your back.  </li>
            <li>I must say that this product is useful for both men and women.  </li>
            <li>and I think these are great addition to the line especially for someone busy at work or school.</li>
            <li>you will feel a distinct tingling, almost a burning feeling.</li>
            <li>Also nice is the absence of a chemical smell.</li>
            <li>You can get dressed right away.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you shave, be aware that using Proactive pads on a freshly shaved face or head will sting a bit - not unlike the sting of witchhazel or aftershave  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a salicylic body wash, which has been fine, but I really don&#x27;t need it over my whole body.</li>
            <li>This product is much more affordable and it gives the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but after trying these Proactive Body Pads for a week, I am definitely impressed.</li>
            <li>so I am happy to have found these and will definitely keep using them as long as they keep working for me.</li>
            <li>This product works well, but I don&#x27;t find it to be any better than Stridex or similar products.</li>
            <li>Pimples appear to clear faster, and the good thing, no scaly, dry</li>
            <li>I doubt if the pads are more effective against acne than other products with the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>And since they&#x27;re easy to use, you&#x27;re more likely to use them regularly, which itself will help in the treatment and prevention of acne.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use and one wipe seems to be enough.</li>
            <li>They do have a strong, somewhat medicinal cross witch hazel scent.</li>
            <li>Sure, it felt like it was working, but it didn&#x27;t really do what it was supposed to, and that is dry up and eliminate skin blemishes.</li>
            <li>My daughter has been getting sporadic bouts of pimples, and most treatments seem to simply dry out the skin without making much of a dent in the pimple problem.</li>
            <li>The pads themselves have a very textured surface for exfoliating and will pull &#x27;loose&#x27; blackheads and dirt from the top of pores.  </li>
            <li>I really like these pads.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and in spite of washing my face a couple of times a day, I end up feeling oily.</li>
            <li>Very convenient size - in terms of both the pad itself and the container.</li>
            <li>The pads remain very moist rather than drying up after you&#x27;ve opened the container.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the whole exfoliation thing.  </li>
            <li>explain, Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads are powerful allies in the fight against body acne.</li>
            <li>I really think they help my post work out acne</li>
            <li>They smell is only strong in the jar and on the pads medicinal, and the witch hazel is mainly what I smell.</li>
            <li>Non harsh yet effective option for controlling breakouts.</li>
            <li>The other thing good about it is that the pads are fairly big</li>
            <li>Especially for body acne, these pads are easy to use, not messy at all and significantly helped to reduce acne around my neck and back.</li>
            <li>After my shower and towel drying, I simply swipe one of these textured pads over my upper back and shoulders, and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hope you have better luck, but for me thumbs down.</li>
            <li>The product labeling does warn that it can cause dryness and peeling, but it&#x27;s more likely to occur if you use multiple acne products together in one area.&lt;br /&gt;Contains 75 pads, each about the size of a makeup compact.  </li>
            <li>Decent.</li>
            <li>the pads are a bit rough and abrasive, and smell strongly of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>There is also alcohol in the formula, so be sure to close the container tightly when not in use to prevent the pads from drying out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Proactiv&#x27;s Clear Zone Body Pads seems to be helping his acne better than the other solutions we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Large and well saturated pads that clearly take your makeup off and show all your grime.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are all proven to work, but, I don&#x27;t see anything really unique about this product, other than the large pad size.</li>
            <li>I found these pads to be very easy to use, and yes I personally am the type who should be using this type of product due to my oily</li>
            <li>I have noticed in the past that different products work for different skin types, but this Proactiv product seems to work great for me.</li>
            <li>Overall, these work well, but at a pretty high price point.</li>
            <li>One gets bang for buck with the 20% products, but one has to be ten times more careful.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a note of caution, those with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They are pretty big and can cover some distance.</li>
            <li>These have been working pretty well for me over the last couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>But the main reason I gave it only 3 stars is because it didn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li>Finally, one pad goes a long way; there&#x27;s a significant amount of cleaning agent on each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads, 75 Count cost $32 via Amazon Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>At any rate, she&#x27;s been using these Proactiv sacylic acid pads once or twice a day for about a week now, and there&#x27;s been a clear improvement.</li>
            <li>Just stare at my face, it&#x27;s virtually clear now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clear zone body pads has helped alleviate the body acne.</li>
            <li>I think it was too over-drying for my sensitive skin?</li>
            <li>This one actually surprised me.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t give me any problems as far as dryness is concerned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d even recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely wiped out the acne on my chest.</li>
            <li>Great product for getting rid of bumps on those hard-to-reach areas - back, behind, back of thighs, etc.</li>
            <li>pads are super convenient to use, much less of a hassle than applying creams or using a face wash.</li>
            <li>I shave my head, and have frequent acne outbreaks on the bare skin - proactive pads have already reduced the problem.  </li>
            <li>Convenient medicated discs with 2% salicylic acne for use on arms, back, chest,  etc...treats existing acne and prevents new breakouts.</li>
            <li>(Admittedly, I don&#x27;t think she followed a very strict regimen, so it&#x27;s possible that if she had she would have seen a reduction in acne prior to using this product.)</li>
            <li>I really like these because they are big enough to use on my neck,</li>
            <li>They are very moist in the package and I find that one pad actually lasts for several applications.  </li>
            <li>I usually am pretty down on Proactiv products.  </li>
            <li>There are 75 pads in the jar and the pads stay wet and are big enough to use on the whole body.  </li>
            <li>in all - and echoing other reviewers - Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads are a terrific product for adult body acne sufferers...</li>
            <li>They are fairly large and tough, and you can cut it to size if you don&#x27;t need the whole pad.</li>
            <li>I noticed their other new products had taken on a teal marketing campaign that comes off as lighter and younger.</li>

            <li> Overall, these work well, but at a pretty high price point.</li>
            <li> One gets bang for buck with the 20% products, but one has to be ten times more careful.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a note of caution, those with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> They are pretty big and can cover some distance.</li>
            <li> These have been working pretty well for me over the last couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> But the main reason I gave it only 3 stars is because it didn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li> Finally, one pad goes a long way; there&#x27;s a significant amount of cleaning agent on each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads, 75 Count cost $32 via Amazon Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> At any rate, she&#x27;s been using these Proactiv sacylic acid pads once or twice a day for about a week now, and there&#x27;s been a clear improvement.</li>
            <li> Just stare at my face, it&#x27;s virtually clear now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clear zone body pads has helped alleviate the body acne.</li>
            <li> I think it was too over-drying for my sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> This one actually surprised me.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t give me any problems as far as dryness is concerned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d even recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely wiped out the acne on my chest.</li>
            <li> Great product for getting rid of bumps on those hard-to-reach areas - back, behind, back of thighs, etc.</li>
            <li> pads are super convenient to use, much less of a hassle than applying creams or using a face wash.</li>
            <li> I shave my head, and have frequent acne outbreaks on the bare skin - proactive pads have already reduced the problem.  </li>
            <li> Convenient medicated discs with 2% salicylic acne for use on arms, back, chest,  etc...treats existing acne and prevents new breakouts.</li>
            <li> (Admittedly, I don&#x27;t think she followed a very strict regimen, so it&#x27;s possible that if she had she would have seen a reduction in acne prior to using this product.)</li>
            <li> I really like these because they are big enough to use on my neck,</li>
            <li> They are very moist in the package and I find that one pad actually lasts for several applications.  </li>
            <li> I usually am pretty down on Proactiv products.  </li>
            <li> There are 75 pads in the jar and the pads stay wet and are big enough to use on the whole body.  </li>
            <li> in all - and echoing other reviewers - Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads are a terrific product for adult body acne sufferers...</li>
            <li> They are fairly large and tough, and you can cut it to size if you don&#x27;t need the whole pad.</li>
            <li> I noticed their other new products had taken on a teal marketing campaign that comes off as lighter and younger.</li>
            <li> The first week of her visit, she didn&#x27;t want me to hug her too hard since it hurt her back.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anybody who has problems with acne, whether it be a small area or large area.</li>
            <li> So it will last a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the main ingredient so if it hasn&#x27;t worked for you in the past, you&#x27;re not likely to get results from this product either.</li>
            <li> The pads do not severely dry out the skin and actually soothe the area affected.  </li>
            <li> This plastic jar is still in their old green and white logo...</li>
            <li> /&gt;After nearly a hundred wasted dollars on different butt/body acne products</li>
            <li> For those using it on their face...and posting negative reviews and/or down-voting positive ones...</li>
            <li> I have other, less caustic products, that do that better.</li>
            <li> However, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger long after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel they are more of a mail order scam that gets near impossible to get out of with a product you can pick up a your local drugstore for at least a third of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Will help control oil yet not leave skin dry.</li>
            <li> My husband has serious bacne, and these wipes are really helping.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient in the pads is sacylic acid (2%), a standard acne medication.</li>
            <li> Second, be cognizant of wiping down sweat before application.</li>
            <li> I use these for my face, but I only need it on my nose an forehead, so I cut the pads in half.  </li>
            <li> next morning (as workouts are at night), applied areas feature slightly shrunken acne heads.</li>
            <li> These are pretty expensive, and there are other similar options out there at a lower price.</li>
            <li> It is 2% in case you are curious.</li>
            <li> I only use once a day and don&#x27;t have trouble with over-drying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will also point out that there is glycolic acid in these pads too, which acts as an exfoliator, minus the roughness you get by using a scrub.</li>
            <li> My daughter reports that the pad is rough when you use it.</li>
            <li> The acne hasn&#x27;t gone away entirely, but it&#x27;s definitely less severe and less</li>
            <li> but I do always use pads similar to these...at least three times a week just to rid my skin of dry skin particles...</li>
            <li> They contain maximum strength salicylic acid PLUS glycolic acid, PLUS other ingredients like panthenol and allantoin which soothe your skin.  </li>
            <li> I simply tear off a small section and use that.</li>
            <li> The instructions warn of the possibilty of extreme drying of the skin</li>
            <li> The Proactiv pads, something we might not have considered due to the cost, do seem to be making a difference.</li>
            <li> come in a jar, and are very wet.  </li>
            <li> If you have tried other products already with the same active ingredients, and gotten poor results, you may want to try something else with different ingredients.  </li>
            <li> 2% salicylic acid, the active ingredient, helps exfoliate too, so that healthier skin emerges sooner.  </li>
            <li> It made me itch like crazy and felt the need to wash it off as quickly as I had put it on.</li>
            <li> These body pads use 2% salicylic acid as a time-proven active ingredient for acne treatment, and glycolic acid as a chemical peel for reducing acne scarring.</li>
            <li> Active ingredient is 2 percent salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> active ingredient is salicylic acid at 2%.</li>
            <li> I see a slight difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Less redness, less bulging</li>
            <li> I often find myself grabbing two or three of these on accident, and it can be a little tricky getting just one out of the container.</li>
            <li> Granted with a little sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lots of little spots and fibers to get a thorough wipe of oils, dirt, debris and what not off your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pro active products have always worked well for my teenagers in the past, and these body pads are no exception.</li>
            <li> , Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads does what all others fail to do.</li>
            <li> These pads do not cause redness or irritation even when used a few times per day</li>
            <li> I have no trouble using salicylic acid based products on my face, but these pads cause an uncomfortable, stinging sensation on my skin.</li>
            <li> To use cleanse the skin thoroughly and cover the entire affected area with a thin layer one to three times a day.</li>
            <li> After just a few days use I&#x27;ve already seen a reductiion in pimples -</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s seen improvement in a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I will get another pack of them after my trial here, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thankfully gotten to the age where I no longer have daily body acne to battle, but I still get the occasional annoying pimple now that I&#x27;ve stepped up my workout routine.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t tear; they are tough little pads.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and was disappointed; I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend the body pads for body acne suffers like myself.</li>
            <li> No overly harsh or unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with!  </li>
            <li> (just don&#x27;t go overboard!).</li>
            <li> There are less expensive products out there, which also work.</li>
            <li> I got this for my twelve-year-old niece who has been suffering from painful back acne.</li>
            <li> I do have another secret on how to use this product on the body.  </li>
            <li> may find these too irritating.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they were too over drying on my troubled spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, body acne, the unfortunate bedfellow of a committed workout routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are great, extra-large size pads that really do clear up your back.  They contain maximum strength salicylic acid PLUS glycolic acid, PLUS other ingredients like panthenol and allantoin which soothe your skin.  I&#x27;ve been known to use these on my face when I run out of my Proactiv toner, and they work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv makes such great products.  I honestly haven&#x27;t found one I&#x27;m not pleased with!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful body pads that one can use on both face and body.  It is perfect for oily and combination oily skin (on the face) because pads are soaked with salicylic acid that prevents acne and helps control oil production.  I must say that this product is useful for both men and women.  I do have another secret on how to use this product on the body.  It is perfect after bikini / brazilian waxing (shaving).  After waxing, it helps going over the skin with this pad because it will help prevent creation of the ingrown hairs.  I know some friends who have been using Image cleansing pads that are soaked with the same ingredients as these.  This product is much more affordable and it gives the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone was asking what is the percentage of salicylic acid in the product.  It is 2% in case you are curious.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after trying these Proactive Body Pads for a week, I am definitely impressed. Especially for body acne, these pads are easy to use, not messy at all and significantly helped to reduce acne around my neck and back. I have used so many products that don&#x27;t do anything at all so I am happy to have found these and will definitely keep using them as long as they keep working for me. I have noticed in the past that different products work for different skin types, but this Proactiv product seems to work great for me.</li>
            <li> These are big pads- much bigger than the ones that I&#x27;ve seen for faces before.  They are more than twice the size of Stridex pads.  They smell is only strong in the jar and on the pads medicinal, and the witch hazel is mainly what I smell. After use, it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any scent on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;They come in a jar, and are very wet.  The pads themselves have a very textured surface for exfoliating and will pull &#x27;loose&#x27; blackheads and dirt from the top of pores.  They clean well- the pads pick up dirt that didn&#x27;t even seem to be there as they are used.  They don&#x27;t tear; they are tough little pads.&lt;br /&gt;The 2% salicylic acid, the active ingredient, helps exfoliate too, so that healthier skin emerges sooner.  It helps reduce inflammation, and keeps bacteria from multiplying.  It also contains witch hazel, which helps constrict the pores and tone the skin, as well as being disinfectant.&lt;br /&gt;After use, I find that it doesn&#x27;t strip skin. The product labeling does warn that it can cause dryness and peeling, but it&#x27;s more likely to occur if you use multiple acne products together in one area.&lt;br /&gt;Contains 75 pads, each about the size of a makeup compact.  Note though, they do stick together rather easily and this could shorten the amount of time the product lasts.  This is a great product for back, arm, and chest breakouts.  The ingredients are all proven to work, but, I don&#x27;t see anything really unique about this product, other than the large pad size.</li>
            <li> I really like these pads. I have very oily skin and in spite of washing my face a couple of times a day, I end up feeling oily. These pads work great for that. They are a nice size and can be tucked in your purse for use at work or school.  ProActiv makes a good product and I think these are great addition to the line especially for someone busy at work or school.</li>
            <li> I see a slight difference in my skin. Not finished with the product. When I&#x27;m done with it, I think I will have a more accurate review of the product.</li>
            <li> Great product that works!</li>
            <li> Who hasn&#x27;t heard of Proactive, and what they boast they can do? I had high hopes for this product and was disappointed; I couldn&#x27;t use it. I rubbed the pad over my troublesome back but upon doing so I felt an overwhelming uncomfortable sensation. It made me itch like crazy and felt the need to wash it off as quickly as I had put it on. I think it was too over-drying for my sensitive skin? I&#x27;ve used products with Salicylic Acid before but I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like that. Hope you have better luck, but for me thumbs down.</li>
            <li> Very convenient size - in terms of both the pad itself and the container. No overly harsh or unnecessary ingredients. Basically a 2% salicylic acid for acne treatment and witch-hazel, an astringent and anti-oxidant with known benefits for skin health.  There is also alcohol in the formula, so be sure to close the container tightly when not in use to prevent the pads from drying out. These pads do not cause redness or irritation even when used a few times per day (just don&#x27;t go overboard!).</li>
            <li> These body pads use 2% salicylic acid as a time-proven active ingredient for acne treatment, and glycolic acid as a chemical peel for reducing acne scarring. These pads do not appear to stain clothes, so you can use them on your body and immediately put on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pads have a rough texture that does a fairly good job of exfoliating the skin and removing dirt from the top of the pores. They are fairly large and tough, and you can cut it to size if you don&#x27;t need the whole pad. They do have a strong, somewhat medicinal cross witch hazel scent. However, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger long after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, these pads are not for me. I tried to use them on my shoulder back and they caused discomfort and itch on my skin. I have no trouble using salicylic acid based products on my face, but these pads cause an uncomfortable, stinging sensation on my skin. Perhaps they were too over drying on my troubled spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed. I generally have good results using salicylic acid based products on my face, but these pads don&#x27;t work well on my body. They may be a good product but they are just not for me.</li>
            <li> Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads, 75 Count cost $32 via Amazon Prime shipping. From experience I&#x27;ve found salicyclic Acid is one of the best acid to help rapidly rid oneself of blemishes/pimples. The pads do not severely dry out the skin and actually soothe the area affected.  I do like this product and would recommend them to people whose acne is responsive to salicylic acid and/or gycolic acids. There are less expensive products out there, which also work. Proactive does help. I suppose if you can afford it, give the product a try.</li>
            <li> I usually am pretty down on Proactiv products.  I feel they are more of a mail order scam that gets near impossible to get out of with a product you can pick up a your local drugstore for at least a third of the cost.  This one actually surprised me.  Large and well saturated pads that clearly take your makeup off and show all your grime.  Lightly scented and functional.  This plastic jar is still in their old green and white logo...I noticed their other new products had taken on a teal marketing campaign that comes off as lighter and younger. Now if I can keep it from stinging my chemical burn from that TCA 80%% skin peel I ordered off Amazon earlier last week, life could be good.</li>
            <li> There are 75 pads in the jar and the pads stay wet and are big enough to use on the whole body.  I personally use them on the areas of the body where bumps appear, the elbows, inner knees.  I have found that the pads work well to get rid of bumps.</li>
            <li> Non harsh yet effective option for controlling breakouts. Feels good on the skin and has a soothing effect. Is a mix of Salicylic and Glycolic Acid. Active ingredient is 2 percent salicylic acid. Can be used on any part of the body. To use cleanse the skin thoroughly and cover the entire affected area with a thin layer one to three times a day. If you experience any dryness you can apply once a day rather than three but it didn&#x27;t give me any problems as far as dryness is concerned. I&#x27;d even recommend it if you have sensitive skin. Will help control oil yet not leave skin dry.</li>
            <li> I use these for my face, but I only need it on my nose an forehead, so I cut the pads in half.  This gives you 150 pads, so it&#x27;s more cost effective.  It works it preventing breakouts during the summer season.  Lots of time in the sun causes my nose to get oily, and a quick wipe with these helps control breakouts.  I only use once a day and don&#x27;t have trouble with over-drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thankfully gotten to the age where I no longer have daily body acne to battle, but I still get the occasional annoying pimple now that I&#x27;ve stepped up my workout routine. I&#x27;ve been using a salicylic body wash, which has been fine, but I really don&#x27;t need it over my whole body. These pads are perfect. After my shower and towel drying, I simply swipe one of these textured pads over my upper back and shoulders, and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness so far. And unlike benzoyl peroxide products, you don&#x27;t have to worry about bleaching your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also point out that there is glycolic acid in these pads too, which acts as an exfoliator, minus the roughness you get by using a scrub.</li>
            <li> these pads work great for chest and back</li>
            <li> I found these pads to be very easy to use, and yes I personally am the type who should be using this type of product due to my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient is salicylic acid at 2%. It&#x27;s potent stuff and one must use with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are products to be found here with 20% salicylic acid, what is called medical strength. One gets bang for buck with the 20% products, but one has to be ten times more careful.</li>
            <li> My teenaged daughter has had some acne on her forehead that was bothering her. She tried some products we had around the house--including putting toothpaste on the affected area overnight--and nothing was working. (Admittedly, I don&#x27;t think she followed a very strict regimen, so it&#x27;s possible that if she had she would have seen a reduction in acne prior to using this product.) At any rate, she&#x27;s been using these Proactiv sacylic acid pads once or twice a day for about a week now, and there&#x27;s been a clear improvement. The acne hasn&#x27;t gone away entirely, but it&#x27;s definitely less severe and less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads are super convenient to use, much less of a hassle than applying creams or using a face wash. The pads remain very moist rather than drying up after you&#x27;ve opened the container. My daughter reports that the pad is rough when you use it. Also, the medicine stings when you apply it, but I would assume that&#x27;s likely to happen with any comparable product. The active ingredient in the pads is sacylic acid (2%), a standard acne medication. I doubt if the pads are more effective against acne than other products with the same ingredients. Their strength lies rather in their convenience. And since they&#x27;re easy to use, you&#x27;re more likely to use them regularly, which itself will help in the treatment and prevention of acne.</li>
            <li> I never knew Proactiv sold their product on Amazon.  I always though they were a direct-mail order company.  My husband sometimes get acne on his shoulder and back.  We&#x27;ve tried getting rid of it using various methods but nothing seems to work except time.  Proactiv&#x27;s Clear Zone Body Pads seems to be helping his acne better than the other solutions we&#x27;ve tried.  These are a nice-sized pad and could possibly be used on your face.  I recommend this product for anybody who has problems with acne, whether it be a small area or large area.</li>
            <li> These have worked great for us on body acne.  But if your skin is not reactive to salicylic acid they may not work for you.  If you have tried other products already with the same active ingredients, and gotten poor results, you may want to try something else with different ingredients.  Since they have worked for us and the price is reasonable compared to the good results we have had, I give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good pads to use on your body. They are pretty big and can cover some distance. I often find myself grabbing two or three of these on accident, and it can be a little tricky getting just one out of the container. These have been working pretty well for me over the last couple of weeks. I&#x27;m not sure that I will get another pack of them after my trial here, though. These are pretty expensive, and there are other similar options out there at a lower price. Overall, these work well, but at a pretty high price point.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but I don&#x27;t find it to be any better than Stridex or similar products. Therefore, it costs more than it should. Go with a cheaper alternative instead.</li>
            <li> The good news is that this product is very strong. The minute it touches your face you will feel a distinct tingling, almost a burning feeling. The other thing good about it is that the pads are fairly big so you don&#x27;t have the use an entire one. I simply tear off a small section and use that. So it will last a fairly long time. But the strong burning feel is a bit too much, and so I deducted one star because of that. But the main reason I gave it only 3 stars is because it didn&#x27;t really work that well. Sure, it felt like it was working, but it didn&#x27;t really do what it was supposed to, and that is dry up and eliminate skin blemishes. Frankly. I have other, less caustic products, that do that better.</li>
            <li> Amazing  It works. After 1 week backne is gone!!!!</li>
            <li> These are oversized...kind of jumbo pads...saturated with a blemish fighter as well as an exfoliater.  I do not have skin that is acne prone but I do always use pads similar to these...at least three times a week just to rid my skin of dry skin particles...that&#x27;s the whole exfoliation thing.  I really like these because they are big enough to use on my neck, d&amp;eacute;colletage area...even shoulders back and upper arms...anywhere that you would like to exfoliate.  These are perfect to use just after a shower and right before applying a self tanner.</li>
            <li> These pads are similar to the acne pads you can buy for your face and neck - but they are made by Proactiv which is a name I recognize for the treatment of acne.  These pads are body pads and are a good large size, they work really well and there isn&#x27;t any sticky residue after you use them or any scent.  You can get dressed right away.  Perfect for getting ready for summer.</li>
            <li> I got this for my twelve-year-old niece who has been suffering from painful back acne. The first week of her visit, she didn&#x27;t want me to hug her too hard since it hurt her back. I ordered this for her after that and she has been using it every night. There has been noticeable improvement. She wants more when this supply runs out and I will order it for her after seeing the change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My niece&#x27;s review: I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for three weeks and it&#x27;s helped a lot. I&#x27;m not as inflamed and it&#x27;s completely wiped out the acne on my chest.</li>
            <li> Decent. I prefer the body wash which seems to have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> **UPDATE: For those using it on their face...and posting negative reviews and/or down-voting positive ones...these are NOT MEANT FOR THE FACIAL AREA. Also, these things worked SO well, I bought another batch.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, body acne, the unfortunate bedfellow of a committed workout routine. Even more so with compression clothing, where moisture wicking tendsto trap oils/dirt beneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly a hundred wasted dollars on different butt/body acne products, Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads does what all others fail to do. Granted with a little sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To explain, Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads are powerful allies in the fight against body acne. Boy, do they clean! Oils and dirt remnants appear on the pads post-use...accompanied by a noticeable zing after use. Also nice is the absence of a chemical smell. Finally, one pad goes a long way; there&#x27;s a significant amount of cleaning agent on each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning (as workouts are at night), applied areas feature slightly shrunken acne heads. (Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day, friends.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s a note of caution, those with very sensitive skin may find these too irritating. Second, be cognizant of wiping down sweat before application. More sweat...more sting. These work better on cleaner skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - and echoing other reviewers - Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads are a terrific product for adult body acne sufferers...especially gym rats. As one pad does its thing and well, one can get ~2 months to tackle the formerly undefeated sweat beast.</li>
            <li> These pads do a nice job of de-greasing my skin. After just a few days use I&#x27;ve already seen a reductiion in pimples - I shave my head, and have frequent acne outbreaks on the bare skin - proactive pads have already reduced the problem.  The instructions warn of the possibilty of extreme drying of the skin but this has not been an issue for me.  I&#x27;ve used them twice a day since starting - once in the morning and once in the evening.  I won&#x27;t say they are pleasant to use - the pads are a bit rough and abrasive, and smell strongly of alcohol.  They are very moist in the package and I find that one pad actually lasts for several applications.  Also, if you shave, be aware that using Proactive pads on a freshly shaved face or head will sting a bit - not unlike the sting of witchhazel or aftershave  Overall, a good product.  Works as promised.</li>
            <li> Proactiv (for the face) was the life saver when I was an angst teenager back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny I am offered to try the body pads as I&#x27;m in my 20s and behold - I embarrassingly have body acne. Just stare at my face, it&#x27;s virtually clear now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My body acne can be found on my chest, back, shoulders, and clavicle. I haven&#x27;t found ANYTHING that will truly rid of my body acne. If someone does, do recommend me. The clear zone body pads has helped alleviate the body acne. Less redness, less bulging pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pad feels like a microfiber made out of cotton. Lots of little spots and fibers to get a thorough wipe of oils, dirt, debris and what not off your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend the body pads for body acne suffers like myself.</li>
            <li> Easy and convenient to use. I really think they help my post work out acne</li>
            <li> Definitely makes a difference in treating back acne. My daughter has been getting sporadic bouts of pimples, and most treatments seem to simply dry out the skin without making much of a dent in the pimple problem. The Proactiv pads, something we might not have considered due to the cost, do seem to be making a difference. Pimples appear to clear faster, and the good thing, no scaly, dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it, it&#x27;s a good solution.</li>
            <li> Pro active products have always worked well for my teenagers in the past, and these body pads are no exception. Convenient medicated discs with 2% salicylic acne for use on arms, back, chest,  etc...treats existing acne and prevents new breakouts. My daughter uses on her shoulders and she&#x27;s seen improvement in a few days. Contains 75 pads.</li>
            <li> My husband has serious bacne, and these wipes are really helping.  I&#x27;ve been using the wipes on his back for about a week now, and he has noticeably fewer zits on his back.  They&#x27;re easy to use and one wipe seems to be enough.</li>
            <li> Great product for getting rid of bumps on those hard-to-reach areas - back, behind, back of thighs, etc. I&#x27;ve always had good results with Salicylic Acid - that&#x27;s the main ingredient so if it hasn&#x27;t worked for you in the past, you&#x27;re not likely to get results from this product either. I used these pads on my lower back and noticed great improvement after about a week. The pads are jumbo sizes so 1 was enough for me to cover a sizeable area. Will be keeping these around for future bathing suit seasons going forward!</li>
