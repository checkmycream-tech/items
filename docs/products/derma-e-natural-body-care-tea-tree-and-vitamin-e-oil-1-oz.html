            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for an easy tea tree oil product or are just getting started with TTO, this is great stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Very very strong.</li>
            <li>The result is a very effective treatment to prevent infection and quickly heal any breaks in the skin.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t say I enjoy the smell, but I keep thinking that I might, if it didn&#x27;t have that nuclear punch.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> A month ago I smashed my thumb in a car door. Of course my nail turned horribly purple and now is about to fall off when it grows out. My sister had a similar injury and recommended this product to keep my new nail from growing fungus or other nasty stuff. So I&#x27;ve been using this almost daily by putting a healthy dose under the old nail and onto the new nail that is growing in. It&#x27;s working really well. And I&#x27;ve found that I use it for all sorts of scrapes and minor cuts. It&#x27;s light but penetrates well. And Tea Tree Oil is a natural treatment for germs and fungus. I like it! Lots! Glad I know that I can find it on Amazon where it will be handy and available.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for my skin! It&#x27;s amazing how well it works. Also I saved roughly 40% buying from Amazon compared to purchasing from dermae.com!</li>
            <li> Genuine product! So far haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference..but still hoping for the best!! does not smell the greatest. But product is as described!</li>
            <li> i love this tea tree oil, i use it every night for my face it doe not cause beakouts and my skin is acne prone skin. it smells strong but not disgusting more minty..it takes a little getting use to but nothing too serious, great for acne on the skin and people with oily skin..i would definetly buy again..oh it also arrived on time!</li>
            <li> I find this little bottle of T Tree Oil excellent for minor skin irritations.  I first used it when I had an unexplained rash on my neck and chest..something like a reddish allergic reaction...OTC Cortisone and a sunburn cream did not help..neither did Benadryl.  After several days I used this oil.....a slight cooling effect and it was gone in 2 days.  Got the redness again...used the oil...and it never came back.  Also used it on the beginning of a cold sore....seemed to stop it from becoming worse.  Sent a bottle to my daughter in law and told my daughter about it.  I have used T Tree oil before but like this brand a lot with the E added.  Seems to have a calming effect on the skin.  A little goes a long way.  My only gripe is that all T Tree oils are overpriced..whether in the health food stores or online.</li>
            <li> Gagged from the smell. Threw it away</li>
            <li> This is a good product. In the summer, I wet a cotton pad and then put a few drops of this on it for a toner. It works well but can be a bit drying. I have not been using it as temperatures cool. Instead, I switched to lavender oil. Either really works to clear and tighten pores. Both have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, too.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, I used to order it religiously before I finally decided it was cheaper to buy tea tree oil and vitamin E separately and mix it myself. I mix it with my facial cleanser since I have acne, it help keep it under control without destroying my skin. For people familiar with tea tree oil, you know that the strong smell is a good thing, lighter-smelling TTO means it&#x27;s been diluted or is old. this stuff is STRONG, as in it reeks, and you can easily clear a room walking in with the bottle open. Very very strong. Good stuff. My only concern is that I do not know if the vitamin E oil they use is the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; stuff or the synthetic stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for an easy tea tree oil product or are just getting started with TTO, this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Works great for acne without drying out skin.  Tea tree naturally has a strong smell so this too, the smell doesn&#x27;t last though.</li>
            <li> My order was delivered on time and everything was as I expected. No problems and I intend on ordering again.</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil is as I expected. It&#x27;s the real deal, thick and with a strong odor. Nothing like a cosmetic.</li>
            <li> Went pretty fast but natural and seemed to work</li>
            <li> Good product for your skin, My son has to much acne and he cleans his face with water and soup very gently in circles. After wash, he applies in his face a little bit of tree tea. And works wonderful.</li>
            <li> They say curiosity kills the cat, and I can see why. I have a mild case of rosacea and so naturally, I clicked on an article I happened to come across that had some tantalizing headline purporting to reveal the cause. [Aside: we all have our own specific things that gross us the heck out. Mine happens to be all things microscopic, and/or things within things. Russian nesting dolls? Not a good gift. The recent advertising trend of animated talking mucus? Also not a fan.] I was vaguely aware of the fact that we all have skin mites, but this article went into such horrific detail about what our pores are filled with (hint: they&#x27;re alive!), how they don&#x27;t excrete, they explode! and so forth, that I was moved first to want my face to melt off ala Raiders of the Lost Ark, and secondly, to find some way to kill these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me, at long last, to tea tree oil, which search after search came up as one of the best solutions. Full strength tea tree oil is said to be too strong for direct application, so this is the product I chose. Even at the 75% tea tree/25% vitamin E dilution, the first time I applied it (no applicator--use a cotton ball), I thought my eyeballs were going to pop out of my head. It isn&#x27;t so much that the scent is unpleasant as the vapors are overwhelming/pungent. I can&#x27;t say I enjoy the smell, but I keep thinking that I might, if it didn&#x27;t have that nuclear punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers of similar products here on Amazon have said they leave the oil on. However, I find it unnecessary to leave it on for long. I leave it on while I brush my teeth and for the duration of my shower, then wash my face off with facial cleanser. Even with the vitamin E, it dries the skin a bit--the areas affected by my rosacea flaked a bit at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week; I think I can feel a difference in that my skin feels smoother and less irritated, but the redness is still there--maybe less. If I notice a vast improvement (or noneat all), I&#x27;ll provide an update.</li>
            <li> Seems like this is a great concept to drying acne and clearing skin....it may just be my skin, but I just don&#x27;t see a difference.  It&#x27;s been a few months though...so perhaps it needs to have more time to be effective.  It actually seems like my acne is worse.  Within the last week I&#x27;ve begun to mix it with pure glycerin to see if it will counteract the dryness. Don&#x27;t want to knock it, so I&#x27;ll just say that it isn&#x27;t as effective on my skin as perhaps others and maybe it needs more time.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of tea tree oil and I like the added Vitamin E in this product.</li>
            <li> This is really awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> Great for acne.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had oily, acne prone skin since I was a young teen. I&#x27;ve tried everything from scary prescription drugs at the dermatologist, to proactive...nothing works as good as using Derma E on my troubled spots! It reduces the oiliness of my skin and clears up blemishes without any pain. No more chemicals or harsh scrubs! I&#x27;m in love with Derma E!</li>
            <li> I have been using this tea tree oil for about three weeks now. I use it in conjunction with Nature&#x27;s Cure 2 Part Acne Treatment, Murad Skin Perfecting Lotion, and Yes To Tomatoes Clear Skin Daily Balancing Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 20, but I have had moderate acne since I was 16. This oil has been helping to clear up my acne. You wouldn&#x27;t think that putting more oil on your face would help clear it up, but it really does. It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores, and it helps to freshen up your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell. It is really strong and unfortunately the smell tends to linger. For me, the pros outweigh the cons, so I&#x27;m continuing to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great use for this stuff is cleaning up new piercings! I recently got my nose pierced and I&#x27;ve been applying small amounts of this oil on my nose. It is helping to keep the swelling down and speed up the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to someone with either of these situations.</li>
            <li> If your cat has claws and you need a quick remedy for scratches, the tea tree oil acts as an antiseptic and the vitamin E helps to heal the skin. The result is a very effective treatment to prevent infection and quickly heal any breaks in the skin.</li>
