    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I find they are best used for daytime.</li>
            <li>She loves it, so it must be great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller&#x27;s service is superb, though.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous!</li>
            <li>The mascara is great I use for bottom lashes to have a Pop of color</li>
            <li>It looked very nice and not too too purple.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is fine itself but the color is the reason I bought it, which isnt so impressive.</li>
            <li>Who thought that was a good idea?</li>
            <li>/&gt;The purple mascara that I absolutely loved (BadGal Plum) has now been discontinued by the company, so I was looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li>If anyone has some good suggestions on ones they&#x27;ve tried, please let me know.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problem with flaking and it has good staying power.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect shade of purple, offers great coverage, and does not leave &amp;#34;raccoon rings&amp;#34; under my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for good coverage/a good mascara with a tint of plum or purple in order to bring out my eyes more.  </li>
            <li>I just responded to someone else&#x27;s comment; however, I wanted to add my own, just so I could give a rating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wears nice.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this one would be a good fit.  </li>
            <li>I love the color purple...</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>It is very useful for doing just that!</li>
            <li>, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those whose eyes water easily.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a fun mascara, and I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Washes off easily with plan soap and water.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself works fine.</li>
            <li>The wand seems to be the same one that comes with the original Great Lash.</li>
            <li>Love the way the violet purple looks on my top lashes as it makes medium blue eyes look like Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s eyes in a unique stand out way!</li>
            <li>Goes on clean and stays that way.  </li>
            <li>You can see the color in the sunlight, which is cool</li>
            <li>was expecting more from Maybelline, so this was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought this shade would be fun, and they love my blue mascara, but it is actually kind of ho-hum</li>
            <li>It was fun to dress up for a change.</li>
            <li>Of all the colors I find the violet and the blue the most useful.</li>
            <li>Maybelline has a consistent winner with it&#x27;s mascara, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>First time I tried this color.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will use it on my top lashes, but only after I&#x27;ve applied a volumizing mascara first because it doesn&#x27;t add much fullness.</li>
            <li>Looks more like a grey with a purple tint.</li>
            <li>This purple needs a few coats, but I love it!</li>
            <li>Bought it for my Girl who is very picky about mascara.</li>
            <li>Color not as vibrant as I&#x27;d hope</li>
            <li>But it does give a nice touch of color to the lashes, if you apply at least two coats.</li>
            <li>Green Envy was my favorite until I found the Violet.</li>
            <li>I expected this to show up with the first application, but when I tried it on, I was very underwhelmed!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and has a really dark purple color.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily on my lower lashes because this color enhances my eyeliner and is softer than black or brown mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a vibrant/bright purple.. more of a dark purple (which you only notice the purple if you are looking at it from an inch away).</li>
            <li>are gifts for 11 year old girls, as there mom gave them permission to wear mascara during playtime; and then immediately wash it away.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have dropped a few more dollars and gotten a higher-end brand that actually shows as purple.</li>
            <li>Decent enough mascara, but I was looking for something that was purple.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed this violet mascara, even though it wasn&#x27;t as dark as I expected.  </li>
            <li>The colors do not show up well and the mascara is thick that it clumps easily.</li>
            <li>The violet color is barely noticeable in daylight.  </li>
            <li>Can barely see the purple.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Can barely see the purple.</li>
            <li> It is a dark violet and is not readily noticeable unless you are very close.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this color, but unfortunately it does not live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> unless you have almost blonde or red lashes, this mascara would be a waste of money for someone wanting purple lashes.</li>
            <li> I bought several colors of this brand and all were not worth the $.  </li>
            <li> The only change I would make with this mascara is to have it a little brighter purple than it is.</li>
            <li> The pink just looks plain weird unless you have pink in your hair, the green is okay</li>
            <li> I would also recommend using a different brush or a few layers for a more dramatic look as the application brush it comes with is thin.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s needs to alittle dark</li>
            <li> The color is so dark that it might as well be black.</li>
            <li> This is a soft and very subtle violet.</li>
            <li> I have to put a lot of coats of this mascara on to have it thicken even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I like it, but thought it was going to be a little darker in color.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little brighter!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the small side, but I like it for the lower lashes.</li>
            <li> You can hardly tell there&#x27;s any mascara going on your lids</li>
            <li> Color is a dull lighter purple.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this mascara as both just a basic mascara and as a tinted one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m sad to say that it&#x27;s not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointing :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it sucks that this product is not WATER PROOF!!!!</li>
            <li> A real disappointment.</li>

            <li> Of all the colors I find the violet and the blue the most useful. The pink just looks plain weird unless you have pink in your hair, the green is okay and I find they are best used for daytime.</li>
            <li> The mascara is fine itself but the color is the reason I bought it, which isnt so impressive. It&#x27;s not a vibrant/bright purple.. more of a dark purple (which you only notice the purple if you are looking at it from an inch away). Totally Teal is def. easier to see &amp; notice. I would also recommend using a different brush or a few layers for a more dramatic look as the application brush it comes with is thin. My lashes are light/ash brown color btw so unless you have almost blonde or red lashes, this mascara would be a waste of money for someone wanting purple lashes.</li>
            <li> This purple needs a few coats, but I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the way the violet purple looks on my top lashes as it makes medium blue eyes look like Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s eyes in a unique stand out way!</li>
            <li> I bought several colors of this brand and all were not worth the $.  The colors do not show up well and the mascara is thick that it clumps easily.</li>
            <li> The violet color is barely noticeable in daylight.  It also doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken the lashes at all, even after several coats.  A real disappointment.</li>
            <li> Can barely see the purple. Looks more like a grey with a purple tint. Dont waste your money on this</li>
            <li> You can hardly tell there&#x27;s any mascara going on your lids and you can&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;violet&amp;#34; color at all.  Should&#x27;ve returned it but didn&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I love the color purple...but it sucks that this product is not WATER PROOF!!!! Who thought that was a good idea? Ugh!!! You can see the color in the sunlight, which is cool</li>
            <li> I just responded to someone else&#x27;s comment; however, I wanted to add my own, just so I could give a rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple mascara that I absolutely loved (BadGal Plum) has now been discontinued by the company, so I was looking for a replacement. I was hoping this one would be a good fit.  However, I&#x27;m sad to say that it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for good coverage/a good mascara with a tint of plum or purple in order to bring out my eyes more.  I find that purple does that well.  I have to put a lot of coats of this mascara on to have it thicken even a little bit. And this has no purple in it. I was very disappointed with this mascara as both just a basic mascara and as a tinted one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting more from Maybelline, so this was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still on the search for a replacement for a purple mascara.  If anyone has some good suggestions on ones they&#x27;ve tried, please let me know.</li>
            <li> Color not as vibrant as I&#x27;d hope; people don&#x27;t remark on it, as they do when I&#x27;m wearing their blue shade. The mascara itself works fine. It just seems to come off as a brown shade of mascara. I am bummed; and I bought 3. 2 are gifts for 11 year old girls, as there mom gave them permission to wear mascara during playtime; and then immediately wash it away. I thought this shade would be fun, and they love my blue mascara, but it is actually kind of ho-hum and I am bummed on behalf of the girls as well.</li>
            <li> This is just a funky purple color that I wanted to wear to my 50th class reunion since I was wearing a purple dress!!!  It looked very nice and not too too purple.  It was fun to dress up for a change.</li>
            <li> I expected this to show up with the first application, but when I tried it on, I was very underwhelmed!</li>
            <li> Maybelline has a consistent winner with it&#x27;s mascara, and this is no exception.  The only change I would make with this mascara is to have it a little brighter purple than it is.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Wish it would be part of Maybelline&#x27;s regular product line. It is the perfect shade of purple, offers great coverage, and does not leave &amp;#34;raccoon rings&amp;#34; under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. wears nice. and u can see the color on ur lashes.  and waterproof.</li>
            <li> Color didn&#x27;t show up.  What&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> First time I tried this color.  I like it, but thought it was going to be a little darker in color.</li>
            <li> I use on my eyebrows to keep them in place!  It is very useful for doing just that! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money. Decent enough mascara, but I was looking for something that was purple. I don&#x27;t notice even a hint of color in the mascara except when it is on the wand. Wish I would have dropped a few more dollars and gotten a higher-end brand that actually shows as purple.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little brighter!</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this violet mascara, even though it wasn&#x27;t as dark as I expected.  Not tearproof, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those whose eyes water easily.  But it does give a nice touch of color to the lashes, if you apply at least two coats.</li>
            <li> This is a soft and very subtle violet. It is a dark violet and is not readily noticeable unless you are very close. I use it primarily on my lower lashes because this color enhances my eyeliner and is softer than black or brown mascara. Sometimes I will use it on my top lashes, but only after I&#x27;ve applied a volumizing mascara first because it doesn&#x27;t add much fullness. It does give me length, but no volume. The wand seems to be the same one that comes with the original Great Lash. It&#x27;s on the small side, but I like it for the lower lashes. I haven&#x27;t had any problem with flaking and it has good staying power. Overall it&#x27;s a fun mascara, and I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The mascara is great I use for bottom lashes to have a Pop of color</li>
            <li> The color is so dark that it might as well be black. You have to cake on the mascara to get any thickness out of it but you can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s purple.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my Girl who is very picky about mascara. She loves it, so it must be great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s needs to alittle dark</li>
            <li> Goes on clean and stays that way.  Washes off easily with plan soap and water.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and has a really dark purple color. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I wish it would have been a lighter purple</li>
            <li> Color is a dull lighter purple.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara. Green Envy was my favorite until I found the Violet. Gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I bought 5 different colors of this mascara. I was really excited about this color, but unfortunately it does not live up to my expectations. It does not look like purple on the lashes, and has no lengthening or volumizing effects. Disappointing :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller&#x27;s service is superb, though.</li>
