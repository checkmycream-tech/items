    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>it&#x27;s the BEST.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent exfoliant for a watery seemingly blah liquid you use in the shower or bathtub.  </li>
            <li>Best body wash</li>
            <li>The product is in perfect conditions.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>My search for a good quality body wash that exfoliates has not brought me the best results until now.</li>
            <li>No one would ever  know but me, but using this keeps my skin from bruising so easily!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great body wash that has almost no smell.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy having it in my shower.</li>
            <li>great exfoliant.</li>
            <li>skin felt great after shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a good lather and he likes the exfoliating bead things.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a good price on it.  </li>
            <li>was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been searching for awhile for a good exfoliating body wash that didn&#x27;t contain a bunch of chemical based, synthetic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bees has always had good products.</li>
            <li>I love Burts!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Living in San Diego, CA you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be able to find this product in the stores!  </li>
            <li>the scent is nice.  </li>
            <li>I tried this body wash a couple of years ago and was absolutely pleased as punch at how good it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept looking, but have not been able to find an exfoliating wash as good as this one.</li>
            <li>I agree that, on its own, this product doesn&#x27;t exfoliate and does sort of feel like you&#x27;re rubbing non-lathering lotion on your skin.</li>
            <li>Nice aroma, I think I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>nice scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large container and it smells really good!</li>
            <li>99.2% natural &amp; sulfate-free, what more can I say!!!  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, finding any kind of body wash that exfoliates at all has proved to be quite a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who did not have the best experience with this product I would definitely recommend trying it again with the exfoliating gloves.</li>
            <li>I use this exfoliating basically in my arms and legs and they look very smooth and radiante now.</li>
            <li>The lather is ok but could be improved.  </li>
            <li>Normally I love Burt&#x27;s Beens products (see my 5-star review for Toner).  </li>
            <li>great item fast service ..very pleased</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful, however one bottle came in an open condition and was leaking I reported it but have received no  reply</li>
            <li>I love this exfoliating body wash.</li>
            <li>Follow up with lotion to lock in moisture :)</li>
            <li>&amp; you can&#x27;t ask for better.  </li>
            <li>Kind of citrus-y, so nice for in the mornings, but not enough to knock you over so, still good for night time too.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have purchased more when it was available.</li>
            <li>and I am prone to rashes easily from using lotions from Bath and Bodyworks.</li>
            <li>, that had had a chemical burn &amp; I bruise easy.  </li>
            <li>All I can really say is that my skin was nicely scented after using this product.  </li>
            <li>So happy to have found a seller who has the same prices as the stores  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees body washes for 4 years now and the Radiance Exfoliating body wash is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this body wash for anyone who is trying to go natural and who also likes the clean feeling this body wash provides while still being fairly environmentally friendly!</li>
            <li>We purchased this body wash based on previous experience with other Burt Bees products and it is very good and Amazon Prime Shipping is great.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the provider, all is ok.</li>
            <li>Mild exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>Just kind of a light floral scent that definitely isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Soft and feels good but seems to run out quickly and doesn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li>So with the loofah it will still be worth using the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural and had fewer chemicals then most products.</li>
            <li>I like it, but will continue to look for a natural body wash I love.</li>
            <li>I started using Burt Bees products when I became pregnant with my first daughter.</li>
            <li>They contain decent ingredients and most seem to really work well.  </li>
            <li>My son deals with excema outbreaks and he likes this product very much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to move him away from other, more chemical laden personal care products and this was the biggest win I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>would definitely get more.  </li>
            <li>I dig the aroma, since it smells warm and milky, so it&#x27;s a natural clean smell on the skin (with more conventional washes, it smells too much like girly flowers or too much like Axe or Old Spice).</li>
            <li>Which is wierd because Burts usually does a really good job on thier products.</li>
            <li>Thing is, most exfoliants are so mild one completely wastes</li>
            <li>But the exfoliating body was leaves much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>Lasts much longer than an exfoliating soap bar.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it didn&#x27;t even really lather.  </li>
            <li>Which left me feeling less than clean as it was just kind of like swirling lotion around on my skin without rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>My skin immediately felt slick and smooth after I rinsed off, unlike the feel I tend to get with many bar soaps, and it lathered up a little better with the gloves as well.</li>
            <li>And after I&#x27;m done using it, I feel like I have to use a second product just to get clean.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will, with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>They even have some decent scents to them.  </li>
            <li>For those who love this product as I do, please contact Burt&#x27;s Bees customer service and let them know as they have discontinued it, but may bring it back if enough people request it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>How&#x27;s that for a WOW!!  </li>
            <li>So then I tried the bath bubble test, which is normally how I get rid of products that don&#x27;t work well on a poof.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Also, the scent is very mild and doesn&#x27;t linger after you&#x27;ve dried off.</li>
            <li>irony is that the small polished jojoba beads would have been perfect for their Willow Bark face scrub which, unfortunatly is the only only other Burt&#x27;s Bees product that I have been disenchanted with on account of the overly harsh and sharp Peach Stone bits that would have been much better suited for this body product!</li>
            <li>But invest $2 on a loofa and your dry skin is instantly transformed into smooth, soft newborn-baby-like skin!</li>
            <li>The exfoliation in this is very gentle, which is great for me since I have thin skin due to taking certain medications for a very long period of time.</li>
            <li>It also relieved my back and shoulders of some mild to moderate acne</li>
            <li>The ingredient were mostly natural too to produce the scent.  </li>
            <li>I quote:  \\&quot;This creamy natural body wash is infused with jojoba beads, so it exfoliates while you</li>
            <li>really it turns out that they only put about 5 jojoba beads in each bottle.</li>
            <li>Considering I have sensitive skin, using skin products with natural and organic ingredients is a necessity.</li>
            <li>This product is not a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>Soft skin every time.</li>
            <li>because I also combine it with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Aloe &amp; Buttermilk Sensitive Skin Lotion.  </li>
            <li>But there just wasn&#x27;t anything to go back for with this particular</li>
            <li>first I thought the beads might have settled to the bottle while sitting on the shelf or something, so I kept shaking it and even had it sitting upside down ready for my next shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally like Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin but needs to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that you can go through a body rather quickly as it is not very thick and there is not very many exfoliating beads, so it is more creamy and not very gritty or exfoliating!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> If you hate bar soap as I do and want a nice clean feel without having dried out skin afterwards then this stuff is for you.</li>
            <li> There are hardly enough hard ingredients to do much exfoliating at all.  </li>
            <li> This product was too disappointing, and I will most likely not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I tend to have really dry skin and was without luck in finding a product that helped.</li>
            <li> It even failed at that as it produced a minute amount of bubbles and they disappeared quickly.  </li>
            <li> I also love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about being exposed to any bad ingredients with Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> But even then the wash almost smells a bit too perfumy for a natural based product, otherwise I might have given it at least 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There really is not any exfoliating going on here unless you are squeezing it out onto a loofah and washing with it that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews on this body wash by a few people that claim it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few exfoliating washes that doesn&#x27;t hurt to use and doesn&#x27;t make my skin red.</li>
            <li> I no longer use any other product for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> Maybe one of their other ones.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t later int he least.  </li>
            <li> The milky base for the body wash is ok.</li>
            <li> Not worthy of Burt&#x27;s Bees name.  </li>
            <li> Not just little ones</li>
            <li> Although there were a few in there that I couldn&#x27;t pronounce.  </li>
            <li> Once I got out the shower, I dried off and applied organic body oil or lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 2 years &amp; always get at least 2 at a time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s increasingly hard to come by.</li>
            <li> The product name is misleading as it does not exfoliate in the least.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50s &amp; was never a sun worshiper</li>
            <li> I hate applying lotion and hoped to find a body wash that could do all the work in one step.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m trying to move him away from other, more chemical laden personal care products and this was the biggest win I&#x27;ve had so far. It&#x27;s got a good lather and he likes the exfoliating bead things. I dig the aroma, since it smells warm and milky, so it&#x27;s a natural clean smell on the skin (with more conventional washes, it smells too much like girly flowers or too much like Axe or Old Spice).</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all and regret purchasing it.  It has a weird smell that is not at all appealing.  The product name is misleading as it does not exfoliate in the least.  The lather is ok but could be improved.  Will not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Normally I love Burt&#x27;s Beens products (see my 5-star review for Toner).  But the exfoliating body was leaves much to be desired.  Not worthy of Burt&#x27;s Bees name.  It doesn&#x27;t later int he least.  There are hardly enough hard ingredients to do much exfoliating at all.  And after I&#x27;m done using it, I feel like I have to use a second product just to get clean.  This product was too disappointing, and I will most likely not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will, with natural ingredients. Mild exfoliation.  I no longer use any other product for this purpose.  Lasts much longer than an exfoliating soap bar.  Amazon has a good price on it.  I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s increasingly hard to come by.</li>
            <li> I generally like Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  They contain decent ingredients and most seem to really work well.  They even have some decent scents to them.  But this one just didn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash is advertised as being exfoliating.  There was no exfoliating going on here.  In fact, it didn&#x27;t even really lather.  Which left me feeling less than clean as it was just kind of like swirling lotion around on my skin without rubbing it in.  So then I tried the bath bubble test, which is normally how I get rid of products that don&#x27;t work well on a poof.  It even failed at that as it produced a minute amount of bubbles and they disappeared quickly.  All I can really say is that my skin was nicely scented after using this product.  I also should note that it says it has royal jelly and jojoba beads in the product.  I can believe the jelly but I didn&#x27;t see any beads while using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the scent is nice.  Just kind of a light floral scent that definitely isn&#x27;t overpowering.  In fact, you don&#x27;t even smell it unless you lift your arm up and sniff it.  So you won&#x27;t be knocking anyone out with the perfumed scent if you try this product.  The ingredient were mostly natural too to produce the scent.  Although there were a few in there that I couldn&#x27;t pronounce.  And the same applies to all the ingredients.  It was a rather lengthy list for a Burt&#x27;s Bees product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this body wash again.  Maybe one of their other ones.  But there just wasn&#x27;t anything to go back for with this particular product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by M. Reynard 2012</li>
            <li> great item fast service ..very pleased</li>
            <li> We purchased this body wash based on previous experience with other Burt Bees products and it is very good and Amazon Prime Shipping is great.</li>
            <li> I quote:  \\&quot;This creamy natural body wash is infused with jojoba beads, so it exfoliates while you cleanse.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Infused? Really? Uhh, No.&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought the beads might have settled to the bottle while sitting on the shelf or something, so I kept shaking it and even had it sitting upside down ready for my next shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really it turns out that they only put about 5 jojoba beads in each bottle. Which is wierd because Burts usually does a really good job on thier products. There really is not any exfoliating going on here unless you are squeezing it out onto a loofah and washing with it that way. Which is what I am doing now. The milky base for the body wash is ok. So with the loofah it will still be worth using the rest of the bottle. But even then the wash almost smells a bit too perfumy for a natural based product, otherwise I might have given it at least 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The irony is that the small polished jojoba beads would have been perfect for their Willow Bark face scrub which, unfortunatly is the only only other Burt&#x27;s Bees product that I have been disenchanted with on account of the overly harsh and sharp Peach Stone bits that would have been much better suited for this body product!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years...it&#x27;s the BEST.</li>
            <li> 99.2% natural &amp; sulfate-free, what more can I say!!!  This is a great body wash that has almost no smell.  The only complaint I have is that you can go through a body rather quickly as it is not very thick and there is not very many exfoliating beads, so it is more creamy and not very gritty or exfoliating!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this body wash for anyone who is trying to go natural and who also likes the clean feeling this body wash provides while still being fairly environmentally friendly!</li>
            <li> I tried this body wash a couple of years ago and was absolutely pleased as punch at how good it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been searching for awhile for a good exfoliating body wash that didn&#x27;t contain a bunch of chemical based, synthetic ingredients. Considering I have sensitive skin, using skin products with natural and organic ingredients is a necessity. I&#x27;ve read several reviews on this body wash by a few people that claim it doesn&#x27;t work. Yes I&#x27;ll admit, it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well with a washcloth. But then I decided to purchase a pair of exfoliating gloves from The Body Shop, and ooohweee, what a difference! My skin immediately felt slick and smooth after I rinsed off, unlike the feel I tend to get with many bar soaps, and it lathered up a little better with the gloves as well. Once I got out the shower, I dried off and applied organic body oil or lotion. Tada! Baby bottom softness! I&#x27;ve kept looking, but have not been able to find an exfoliating wash as good as this one. As a matter of fact, finding any kind of body wash that exfoliates at all has proved to be quite a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who did not have the best experience with this product I would definitely recommend trying it again with the exfoliating gloves. My search for a good quality body wash that exfoliates has not brought me the best results until now. For those who love this product as I do, please contact Burt&#x27;s Bees customer service and let them know as they have discontinued it, but may bring it back if enough people request it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent exfoliant for a watery seemingly blah liquid you use in the shower or bathtub.  Next day you are flaking.&lt;br /&gt;This is called exfoliating and that is what it is supposed to do.  Thing is, most exfoliants are so mild one completely wastes&lt;br /&gt;their money.  This product is not a waste of money.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I agree that, on its own, this product doesn&#x27;t exfoliate and does sort of feel like you&#x27;re rubbing non-lathering lotion on your skin. But invest $2 on a loofa and your dry skin is instantly transformed into smooth, soft newborn-baby-like skin! Best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation in this is very gentle, which is great for me since I have thin skin due to taking certain medications for a very long period of time. It&#x27;s a large container and it smells really good! Kind of citrus-y, so nice for in the mornings, but not enough to knock you over so, still good for night time too. I really like it!</li>
            <li> I tend to have really dry skin and was without luck in finding a product that helped. I hate applying lotion and hoped to find a body wash that could do all the work in one step. This did. It also relieved my back and shoulders of some mild to moderate acne I get. I would recommend applying this product with either a loofa or something that has an exfoliating effect. I use an exfoliating shower towel. Also, the scent is very mild and doesn&#x27;t linger after you&#x27;ve dried off.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, however one bottle came in an open condition and was leaking I reported it but have received no  reply</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliating body wash. It&#x27;s one of the few exfoliating washes that doesn&#x27;t hurt to use and doesn&#x27;t make my skin red. I don&#x27;t know how to describe the scent, but I find it pleasing. I also love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about being exposed to any bad ingredients with Burt&#x27;s Bees. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin but needs to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> The product is in perfect conditions. Thanks to the provider, all is ok. I recommend and i save to my favorites.</li>
            <li> I love Burts! This product does not disappoint. Soft skin every time. Follow up with lotion to lock in moisture :)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I am prone to rashes easily from using lotions from Bath and Bodyworks. I started using Burt Bees products when I became pregnant with my first daughter. I wanted something natural and had fewer chemicals then most products. I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees body washes for 4 years now and the Radiance Exfoliating body wash is by far my favorite! If you hate bar soap as I do and want a nice clean feel without having dried out skin afterwards then this stuff is for you.</li>
            <li> My son deals with excema outbreaks and he likes this product very much.  He uses it regularly and it does help him control outbreaks.  He likes the feel of it as well as the scent of it.</li>
            <li> I use this exfoliating basically in my arms and legs and they look very smooth and radiante now. I use this product twice a week and I&#x27;m so happy having it in my shower. Love it!</li>
            <li> Soft and feels good but seems to run out quickly and doesn&#x27;t go very far. I like it, but will continue to look for a natural body wash I love.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma, I think I&#x27;m hooked. I was using Trader Joe&#x27;s for the last 10 years, but now I&#x27;m a Bee Person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50s &amp; was never a sun worshiper so maybe that&#x27;s a plus.  Living in San Diego, CA you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be able to find this product in the stores!  But it&#x27;s the best &amp; you can&#x27;t ask for better.  I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 2 years &amp; always get at least 2 at a time.  I&#x27;ve very sensitive skin, that had had a chemical burn &amp; I bruise easy.  No one would ever  know but me, but using this keeps my skin from bruising so easily!!! How&#x27;s that for a WOW!!  I&#x27;ve run out before &amp; picked up name brand exfoliating body washes &amp; bruises started showing up again.  Not just little ones Big bruises!  So now I know &amp; you do too!  I never dreamed that a body wash could do something like that, but maybe its because I also combine it with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Aloe &amp; Buttermilk Sensitive Skin Lotion.  I don&#x27;t know, but I trust cthis duo &amp; won&#x27;t be using any others!! So happy to have found a seller who has the same prices as the stores  &amp; it comes to me without searching all over San Diego.</li>
            <li> great exfoliant. nice scent. skin felt great after shower. would definitely get more.  Burt  Bees has always had good products.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I wish I would have purchased more when it was available.</li>
