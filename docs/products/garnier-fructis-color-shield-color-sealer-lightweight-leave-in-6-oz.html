            <li>I love that Garnier Fructis now has a Color Shield line of products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li>Love to wash and wear my hair with this.</li>
            <li>It makes the gel much more pliable.</li>
            <li>Plus there&#x27;s the added bonus of cheap pricing!</li>
            <li>Lightweight and seems to be safe for color-treated hair, as claimed, but this seems more like a styling gel rather than a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy looking and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>used it,  LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I was so glad I could order it and am so pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This is the best leave in color for women with blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy or slimy and I never had a problem with static electricity in the winter.</li>
            <li>but i love how it feel when i put it in my hands just like garnier fructis products i have used some of the products before and love the results</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good packaging.</li>
            <li>its really light weight...not the density for a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>I  have been using this product a long time and have great results after sampooing.</li>
            <li>My review of this (&amp; most hair care products in general) is based on 2 important things: 1).How</li>
            <li>But it does make my hair soft and supple. :-)</li>
            <li>It keeps my RED color vibrant &amp; Healthy!</li>
            <li>Need more, love it, makes hair color last so long.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this in any local store and was super excited to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner leaves my hair soft and FULL of body.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair curly, as it should be, but seems to dry it out more than anything else.</li>
            <li>I love using this after I towel dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; in my color, though.</li>
            <li>Recommend it very highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ronv</li>
            <li>It really protects the color.  </li>
            <li>From $35 Salon products to everyday drugstore brands &amp; this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>other than that its fine.</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing mine away, these did absolutely nothing to keep the red.</li>
            <li>I put it on first on my wet hair</li>

            <li> Just gets sticky and hard. Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I color my hair red, which fades the fastest. I love that Garnier Fructis now has a Color Shield line of products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff it is great in my hair and gives it some body.  Love to wash and wear my hair with this.</li>
            <li> I keeps my hair supe moisterized. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I put it on first on my wet hair and then I put on my styling gel. It makes the gel much more pliable. I don&#x27;t think it really &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; in my color, though. But it does make my hair soft and supple. :-) I hope to use it forever!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! My review of this (&amp; most hair care products in general) is based on 2 important things: 1).How well the product works at the time of use AND 2).How well the product has performed over long-term use-And this product has earned FIVE STARS for BOTH! Plus there&#x27;s the added bonus of cheap pricing! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ll spend money on a  hair product IF it really works and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all AND spent some serious money in the process. From $35 Salon products to everyday drugstore brands &amp; this is by far my favorite! It instantly conditions &amp; smooths my hair, yet is so lightweight I use it everyday without my hair feeling weighed down or flat. It keeps my RED color vibrant &amp; Healthy! Definitely reccomend!</li>

            <li> Please save your money. I ended up throwing mine away, these did absolutely nothing to keep the red. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product anywhere and I found it on Amazon ordered it, used it,  LOVE it. This leave in conditioner leaves my hair soft and FULL of body. Its lightweight and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this and I had looked everywhere for it and could not find it.  I was so glad I could order it and am so pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in color for women with blonde hair.  I&#x27;m an african american woman with white blonde hair, (it&#x27;s fierce, wish I could upload a picture).</li>
            <li> I love using this after I towel dry my hair. It&#x27;s not greasy or slimy and I never had a problem with static electricity in the winter.</li>
            <li> its really light weight...not the density for a leave in conditioner i am used to. other than that its fine.</li>
            <li> I have not put this in my hair but i love how it feel when i put it in my hands just like garnier fructis products i have used some of the products before and love the results hope this one do the same for me.</li>
