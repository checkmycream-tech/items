    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great products!</li>
            <li>But over all good!!!</li>
            <li>I especially enjoyed the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is the best price I could find for these, in store or online!</li>
            <li>Still, it was the best thing that I had tried, so I used it for years.</li>
            <li>The spot treatment doesn&#x27;t have the best smell in the world, but it works like</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
            <li>I also bought a toner and it all goes great together!</li>
            <li>However, I would recommend the spot treatment, it works like a charm and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>Its great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect acne solution for my skin for over 8 years and still haven&#x27;t found the one.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is very good, but smells funky.  </li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>But I find that I don&#x27;t need it anymore and just the cleanser and moisturizer are working beautifully.</li>
            <li>This thing works, and works beautifully.</li>
            <li>In the firs week, this product worked great.</li>
            <li>Great product for her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already reviewed the moisturizer and cleanser separately--I think they work great</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product that works well for me.</li>
            <li>Seriously so happy.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that Burt&#x27;s Bee does sells the products separately.     </li>
            <li>Smells and feels great on your skin.  </li>
            <li>This face wash system is great.  </li>
            <li>Great price and packaging.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this set!!</li>
            <li>The cream is also very nice feeling.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing acne wash!</li>
            <li>and my skin is beautiful and my pores have shrunk and it&#x27;s seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>It did smell good though.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit because this is a good company.</li>
            <li>As someone struggling with acne for over 20 years, I feel that I have good authority to rate this product as there is nothing for acne that I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li>The smell of the product is good.</li>
            <li>The product smells nice and its moisturizer was good.</li>
            <li>it is one of the very best, Acne product for my face that works real well and good.</li>
            <li>and I was breaking out more than I ever have; to the point where my family and friends were asking what the heck happened to my nice skin!</li>
            <li>becuase it helped me alot my skins pretty much perfect after 4 days of taking</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Great product, smooth silky skin with noticeable clearer skin in days.  </li>
            <li>its amazing.</li>
            <li>because after 2 weeks my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest though, I bought the Burt&#x27;s Bees clarifying toner and use it before I use step 2.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be honest</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every popular &amp;#34;acne-solution&amp;#34; drugstore brand on the market</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every product and everything just kind of works</li>
            <li>The spot treatment has a very strong scent and sometimes it feels like my skin is burning.  </li>
            <li>Light weight, but it does a good job of keeping my face moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I continue to use the cleanser, as it is the best I have found, but still can&#x27;t find something to work on my combination acne/ sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had perfect skin all through my teens and suddenly in my early 20s</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying the set because it is cheap if you want to give it a try, or if you can find a good deal on just the cleanser, that is the better choice.</li>
            <li>Combined with a good diet we love how our skin looks right now after about a month of use!</li>
            <li>I believe the product is good for mild acne.</li>
            <li>I have been using this kit for more than a month and the acne has cleared up dramatically.</li>
            <li>I need it the most, but I have noticed the spot treatment works better when applied with a cottonpad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- then again my skin seems to react WAY better to salycic acid than benzoyl peroxide, though.</li>
            <li>I love the Buts Bees cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I love the moisturizer though.</li>
            <li>The lotion is probably my favorite part of the kit.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone also looks more even.</li>
            <li>The gel cleanser feels more like water to me.  </li>
            <li>It seems like the simpler the product, like cetaphyl, the better.</li>
            <li>works ok some of the time.</li>
            <li>, I found the magic answer&lt;</li>
            <li>and I LOVE what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the products don&#x27;t sting like some that contain salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil works better as a spot treatment than the one they give you in this kit and</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>The smell was the most off putting.  </li>
            <li>It was absolutely overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Ive struggled with acne for many many years</li>
            <li>Better to buy through amazon than at store.</li>
            <li>I love Burts Bees products.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and I feel so much better and confident about myself.</li>
            <li>and once I started using this product I began to develop more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was glad I did</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for general face washing and a good starter kit to get your skin care routine going.</li>
            <li>I tried Burts Bees and it worked pretty good for my acne.  </li>
            <li>My face feels nice, clean, and free of grease after using the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This kit has been great so far.</li>
            <li>Natural product and very effective.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and was excited when I came across this kit.</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural and gentler and this seemed like a great fit.</li>
            <li>The cleanser didn&#x27;t make my face feel clean either, just more oily.  </li>
            <li>This particular set on Amazon is a good value.  </li>
            <li>if you can get pass the smell then it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Great for people with dry skin :)</li>
            <li>but I never notice a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy Burts&#x27; make-up and chapsticks.</li>
            <li>So far, so good with this.</li>
            <li>Results are fast and you will be thankful because i know i was!!!</li>
            <li>The extra nice effect is that it seems that my skin tone is becoming more even after using the products.</li>
            <li>I had read such great things about this product and I was so excited to try it; I was pregnant at the time</li>
            <li>This stuff isnt anything special.</li>
            <li>The biggest change I saw RIGHT AWAY was the redness was disappearing!</li>
            <li>After using this product for many months, I can really see a difference in how my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I was full of doubt and about to except the fact that I will always have Acne (im 22 now and have suffered from the condition ever since i was 14)</li>
            <li>All natural and effective is all you need to know.</li>
            <li>no bad side effects, not an invasive pill just a viatimin&lt;</li>
            <li>but they are not nearly as bad as before.</li>
            <li>You can slather the lotion all over your face; it&#x27;s fine for the most sensitive skin and eyes!</li>
            <li>Personally, I have experienced nothing but positive results since I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>I think she&#x27;d be better off to use it more regularly, but hey, that&#x27;s not the products&#x27; issue.</li>
            <li>Proactiv customer service told me to try the super strength formula, which didn&#x27;t help either.     </li>
            <li>The first week this product was amazing, my daughters skin was so clear.</li>
            <li>Whenever I was using the lotion and the cleanser together, my face would get really shiny and oily, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that was because the cleanser was drying my skin out.</li>
            <li>After the first week I started getting inflamed pimples!</li>
            <li>I liked that the cleanser was kind of thin, almost watery, so it rinsed off easily, but I did not like the smell.</li>
            <li>And its natural which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>Burts Bees by far is their favorite face regime product.</li>
            <li>The face wash and the spot treatment are ok but for sensitive or acne prone skin I would not use the lotion.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because I love natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin ever.</li>
            <li>I was using Proactiv right before I bought the kit</li>
            <li>I discontinued this product right away.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve switched to a gentler cleanser, the lotion has just the right balance of moisturizing and treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doing everything right</li>
            <li>and it seemed to help a lot right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now; at first I saw results, my acne bumps started to clear a bit THEN they started popping out more  </li>
            <li>The face wash lathers really well and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li>I guess if your skin just doesn&#x27;t like a certain line of products, it never will!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle but nothing else has worked.</li>
            <li>I ran out of the spot treatment quickly because I had an intense breakout, so I haven&#x27;t been using it.</li>
            <li>I finally gave up and decided to try something natural after reading a couple of good reviews for Burt&#x27;s Bees acne products.</li>
            <li>so the appeal of an all natural product was huge for me.</li>
            <li>the kit seems to moisturize my face very well too!</li>
            <li>My face has shown evident acne reduction.</li>
            <li>Then I got on the pill and, while it had no effect on my skin, it made me absolutely bonkers!</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, smoother, and just overall better than it was before.</li>
            <li>Also, since I am not using the hydrating lotion, I am going to be able to save some money by buying the products separately - instead of buying the kit, I&#x27;ll buy only the two products I use.</li>
            <li>Never have I been able to put lotion on my face, and open my eyes, and NOT have it burn somewhat!</li>
            <li>I still get occasional break outs (mostly around that time of the month)</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve used many Burt&#x27;s Bees products that work very well, but this acne kit is not one of them.</li>
            <li>So after reading all the positive reviews i thought that i should give it a chance.</li>
            <li>This is the first one ever that really moist your facel</li>
            <li>and I love that Burt&#x27;s Bees offers natural products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>Plain old tea tree oil is far more effective for taking care of blemishes.</li>
            <li>Only thing is spot treatment really strong, burned my skin a couple of times.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t seem strong enough.</li>
            <li>And after two weeks I have no new break outs and can see a HUGE difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>Proactiv left me full of dark spots but this is doing a pretty nice job in getting rid of them.    </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m throwing the whole lot in the bin because my acne is the wost it&#x27;s been in my whole life and</li>
            <li>I have really stubborn acne around my chin and jawline, NOTHING seemed to work on it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>However, the spot treatment used up fast.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; being very drying, but it is not at all.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>As much I wanted this to work, it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>In the future, I hope to use more natural, gentle solutions once my skin clears, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li>I am not using the hydrating lotion, though, because my skin is really oily</li>
            <li>and I the lotion was too much for my skin type</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really grateful for this product.</li>
            <li>The lotion that comes with this set makes my skin feel tacky for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>to much makeup or use un cleaned makeup</li>
            <li>This stuff really really works.  </li>
            <li>I really like the moisturizer though.</li>
            <li>Despite all this, I still love every other Burt&#x27;s Bees product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I will preface this by saying that I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and will continue to use their other products, however this product was not for me.  </li>
            <li>I am 23 years old and cannot say I&#x27;ve consistently washed and cared for my face at all.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and suffering from acne for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li>First, I used up the cleanser far faster than anything else</li>
            <li>I was ready to stop but decided to give it a little more time to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It all feels gentle on the skin, and the face lotion is nice a thick</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to someone with mild acne, but it didn&#x27;t totally get rid of my breakouts as well as Grandpa&#x27;s Thylox soap with Sulpher, which is what I use now.</li>
            <li>i had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>- I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>Bought this because of the natural ingredients, and I like most of their other products.</li>
            <li>Even though I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results, I know it can take a while for skin to clear up, I kept using the whole system until I ran out of cleanser.</li>
            <li>Usually once I finish a product I move on to something else, but this set is actually good enough to keep using.  </li>
            <li>Well I got this right before I took my act and my driving test on the same day</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected, Product is for dry skin to normal only which it did not work for me</li>
            <li>When it stopped useing it the pimples went away and got new ones.</li>
            <li>I about two weeks of use my skin already looked better than it did in a long, long time.</li>
            <li>It does smell a little minty however, that goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I also have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(it was making my skin very sensitive).</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and married.</li>
            <li>is not the best product to get :(</li>
            <li>their spot treatment is pretty good in my opinion but it still stinks like the rest of the products in this kit.</li>
            <li>Back in high school I tried some Burts facial products and found they made me oily, but given that I&#x27;m almost 30 now and dealing with light adult acne, I figured my skin has changed enough to give this line a try.</li>
            <li>so I finally went the all natural route with Lush products &amp; got some really positive results within in a couple of months.</li>
            <li>I have tried all of these Acne kits, Proactiv, Clean &amp; Clean, PanOxyl, Neutrogena, Clearasil, Aveeno, and even tried several PRESCRIBED Acne medications and kits and had so much frustration after time and time again seeing little to no results and an empty wallet!</li>
            <li>so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>Also,it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 13 year old daughter</li>
            <li>tried EVERYTHING from prescription to natural remedies and nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the ONLY product that dries out the blemish FAST.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 29 year old mom of 2</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the texture of the spot solution - it is kind of watery.</li>
            <li>I love the face that the product is almost 100% natural but that comes with the face that it&#x27;s slow the process of healing your acne problem.</li>
            <li>When I was in high school, I was lucky enough to not really struggle with acne.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and less noticeable, skin tone is more even, and I generally get far fewer blemishes than I once did.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product works for people with very different skin than mine (which is definitely combination and sensitive), but it&#x27;s certainly not right for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for over a month now (washing my face 3 times daily, moisturizing 2 times daily, exfoliating 3 times/week, and using spot treatment in the evenings).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit, especially if you are someone who struggles with sensitive/combination skin like me!</li>
            <li>I have mild acne, and after a weeks use, I noticed little to no break outs.</li>
            <li>I was using Proactiv before and, although it helped a little, it made my skin super flaky and irritated, and the acne was still there.</li>
            <li>It took a little longer to clear up my patch of acne with Burt&#x27;s Bees, but the way the cleanser made my face feel was worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a deep down clean feel.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li>Late 30&#x27;s mom and teenage daughters all use this product and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I was so tired of using acne products with so many chemicals, so one day i googled natural acne solutions and the burt&#x27;s bees acne kit showed up.</li>
            <li>and this is really the only skincare regime that I&#x27;ve bothered to purchase multiple times.  </li>
            <li>I was really stressed about having both of my tests back to back however</li>
            <li>I wanted a gentler, more natural product for my face, so I stopped using Proactiv and switched to cleansers with no medication, then when my acne got worse, I started using this kit.</li>
            <li>, my face was clean, my diet was healthy, no fired foods/vegatarian but still got bad acne on forehead and temples.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this kit, my adult acne had really been driving me crazy</li>
            <li>This helped to clear acne on my forehead and face just wish the acne spot treatment bottle was bigger.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that the acne gets worse before it gets better, so I kept on with the treatments.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get rid if my current acne it made it last longer, but it didn&#x27;t give me any new pimples.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very creamy, which I expected since there are no parabens or sulfates, but it just doesn&#x27;t spread very well and my face doesn&#x27;t feel particularly moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other stuff before nothing works as fast as this does.</li>
            <li>Also being a guy other acne stuff that you would buy smells very feminine</li>
            <li>It has really helped clear up my acne but hasn&#x27;t dried my face out.</li>
            <li>I admit I was a little worried when I used it the first couple of times.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty harsh regimen considering I stopped Proactiv b/c</li>
            <li>However, since Lush products are known to be pricey (but moderately affordable &amp; not at all ridiculously expensive like Clinique), I wanted to look for a much more affordable product.</li>
            <li>I had cystic acne right before I used it and the acne seemed to subside quicker than usual.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes when I purchased this item, especially considering the other reviews I read.  </li>
            <li>It sinks in fast and definitely helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li>It does come out of the bottle a little fast.</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled fine, but I saw no improvement after using twice daily for 2 months, if anything acne was worse at times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the spot treatment, it didn&#x27;t work for me, it had a really pungent smell, and it burned a little when I applied it to open pimples.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Great products!</li>
            <li> But over all good!!!</li>
            <li> I especially enjoyed the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I could find for these, in store or online!</li>
            <li> Still, it was the best thing that I had tried, so I used it for years.</li>
            <li> The spot treatment doesn&#x27;t have the best smell in the world, but it works like</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
            <li> I also bought a toner and it all goes great together!</li>
            <li> However, I would recommend the spot treatment, it works like a charm and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Its great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect acne solution for my skin for over 8 years and still haven&#x27;t found the one.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is very good, but smells funky.  </li>
            <li> Good Luck!</li>
            <li> But I find that I don&#x27;t need it anymore and just the cleanser and moisturizer are working beautifully.</li>
            <li> This thing works, and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> In the firs week, this product worked great.</li>
            <li> Great product for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already reviewed the moisturizer and cleanser separately--I think they work great</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product that works well for me.</li>
            <li> Seriously so happy.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that Burt&#x27;s Bee does sells the products separately.     </li>
            <li> Smells and feels great on your skin.  </li>
            <li> This face wash system is great.  </li>
            <li> Great price and packaging.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this set!!</li>
            <li> The cream is also very nice feeling.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing acne wash!</li>
            <li> and my skin is beautiful and my pores have shrunk and it&#x27;s seriously amazing.</li>
            <li> Really good product.</li>
            <li> It did smell good though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit because this is a good company.</li>
            <li> As someone struggling with acne for over 20 years, I feel that I have good authority to rate this product as there is nothing for acne that I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is good.</li>
            <li> The product smells nice and its moisturizer was good.</li>
            <li> it is one of the very best, Acne product for my face that works real well and good.</li>
            <li> and I was breaking out more than I ever have; to the point where my family and friends were asking what the heck happened to my nice skin!</li>
            <li> becuase it helped me alot my skins pretty much perfect after 4 days of taking</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product, smooth silky skin with noticeable clearer skin in days.  </li>
            <li> its amazing.</li>
            <li> because after 2 weeks my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest though, I bought the Burt&#x27;s Bees clarifying toner and use it before I use step 2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every popular &amp;#34;acne-solution&amp;#34; drugstore brand on the market</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product and everything just kind of works</li>
            <li> The spot treatment has a very strong scent and sometimes it feels like my skin is burning.  </li>
            <li> Light weight, but it does a good job of keeping my face moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I continue to use the cleanser, as it is the best I have found, but still can&#x27;t find something to work on my combination acne/ sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had perfect skin all through my teens and suddenly in my early 20s</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the set because it is cheap if you want to give it a try, or if you can find a good deal on just the cleanser, that is the better choice.</li>
            <li> Combined with a good diet we love how our skin looks right now after about a month of use!</li>
            <li> I believe the product is good for mild acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for more than a month and the acne has cleared up dramatically.</li>
            <li> I need it the most, but I have noticed the spot treatment works better when applied with a cottonpad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - then again my skin seems to react WAY better to salycic acid than benzoyl peroxide, though.</li>
            <li> I love the Buts Bees cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I love the moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> The lotion is probably my favorite part of the kit.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone also looks more even.</li>
            <li> The gel cleanser feels more like water to me.  </li>
            <li> It seems like the simpler the product, like cetaphyl, the better.</li>
            <li> works ok some of the time.</li>
            <li> , I found the magic answer&lt;</li>
            <li> and I LOVE what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the products don&#x27;t sting like some that contain salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil works better as a spot treatment than the one they give you in this kit and</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> The smell was the most off putting.  </li>
            <li> It was absolutely overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Ive struggled with acne for many many years</li>
            <li> Better to buy through amazon than at store.</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees products.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> and I feel so much better and confident about myself.</li>
            <li> and once I started using this product I began to develop more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was glad I did</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for general face washing and a good starter kit to get your skin care routine going.</li>
            <li> I tried Burts Bees and it worked pretty good for my acne.  </li>
            <li> My face feels nice, clean, and free of grease after using the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This kit has been great so far.</li>
            <li> Natural product and very effective.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and was excited when I came across this kit.</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural and gentler and this seemed like a great fit.</li>
            <li> The cleanser didn&#x27;t make my face feel clean either, just more oily.  </li>
            <li> This particular set on Amazon is a good value.  </li>
            <li> if you can get pass the smell then it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Great for people with dry skin :)</li>
            <li> but I never notice a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy Burts&#x27; make-up and chapsticks.</li>
            <li> So far, so good with this.</li>
            <li> Results are fast and you will be thankful because i know i was!!!</li>
            <li> The extra nice effect is that it seems that my skin tone is becoming more even after using the products.</li>
            <li> I had read such great things about this product and I was so excited to try it; I was pregnant at the time</li>
            <li> This stuff isnt anything special.</li>
            <li> The biggest change I saw RIGHT AWAY was the redness was disappearing!</li>
            <li> After using this product for many months, I can really see a difference in how my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> I was full of doubt and about to except the fact that I will always have Acne (im 22 now and have suffered from the condition ever since i was 14)</li>
            <li> All natural and effective is all you need to know.</li>
            <li> no bad side effects, not an invasive pill just a viatimin&lt;</li>
            <li> but they are not nearly as bad as before.</li>
            <li> You can slather the lotion all over your face; it&#x27;s fine for the most sensitive skin and eyes!</li>
            <li> Personally, I have experienced nothing but positive results since I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> I think she&#x27;d be better off to use it more regularly, but hey, that&#x27;s not the products&#x27; issue.</li>
            <li> Proactiv customer service told me to try the super strength formula, which didn&#x27;t help either.     </li>
            <li> The first week this product was amazing, my daughters skin was so clear.</li>
            <li> Whenever I was using the lotion and the cleanser together, my face would get really shiny and oily, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that was because the cleanser was drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> After the first week I started getting inflamed pimples!</li>
            <li> I liked that the cleanser was kind of thin, almost watery, so it rinsed off easily, but I did not like the smell.</li>
            <li> And its natural which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> Burts Bees by far is their favorite face regime product.</li>
            <li> The face wash and the spot treatment are ok but for sensitive or acne prone skin I would not use the lotion.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I love natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin ever.</li>
            <li> I was using Proactiv right before I bought the kit</li>
            <li> I discontinued this product right away.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve switched to a gentler cleanser, the lotion has just the right balance of moisturizing and treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doing everything right</li>
            <li> and it seemed to help a lot right away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now; at first I saw results, my acne bumps started to clear a bit THEN they started popping out more  </li>
            <li> The face wash lathers really well and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li> I guess if your skin just doesn&#x27;t like a certain line of products, it never will!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle but nothing else has worked.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the spot treatment quickly because I had an intense breakout, so I haven&#x27;t been using it.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up and decided to try something natural after reading a couple of good reviews for Burt&#x27;s Bees acne products.</li>
            <li> so the appeal of an all natural product was huge for me.</li>
            <li> the kit seems to moisturize my face very well too!</li>
            <li> My face has shown evident acne reduction.</li>
            <li> Then I got on the pill and, while it had no effect on my skin, it made me absolutely bonkers!</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer, smoother, and just overall better than it was before.</li>
            <li> Also, since I am not using the hydrating lotion, I am going to be able to save some money by buying the products separately - instead of buying the kit, I&#x27;ll buy only the two products I use.</li>
            <li> Never have I been able to put lotion on my face, and open my eyes, and NOT have it burn somewhat!</li>
            <li> I still get occasional break outs (mostly around that time of the month)</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve used many Burt&#x27;s Bees products that work very well, but this acne kit is not one of them.</li>
            <li> So after reading all the positive reviews i thought that i should give it a chance.</li>
            <li> This is the first one ever that really moist your facel</li>
            <li> and I love that Burt&#x27;s Bees offers natural products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Plain old tea tree oil is far more effective for taking care of blemishes.</li>
            <li> Only thing is spot treatment really strong, burned my skin a couple of times.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t seem strong enough.</li>
            <li> And after two weeks I have no new break outs and can see a HUGE difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> Proactiv left me full of dark spots but this is doing a pretty nice job in getting rid of them.    </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m throwing the whole lot in the bin because my acne is the wost it&#x27;s been in my whole life and</li>
            <li> I have really stubborn acne around my chin and jawline, NOTHING seemed to work on it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> However, the spot treatment used up fast.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; being very drying, but it is not at all.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> As much I wanted this to work, it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> In the future, I hope to use more natural, gentle solutions once my skin clears, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I am not using the hydrating lotion, though, because my skin is really oily</li>
            <li> and I the lotion was too much for my skin type</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really grateful for this product.</li>
            <li> The lotion that comes with this set makes my skin feel tacky for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> to much makeup or use un cleaned makeup</li>
            <li> This stuff really really works.  </li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> Despite all this, I still love every other Burt&#x27;s Bees product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I will preface this by saying that I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and will continue to use their other products, however this product was not for me.  </li>
            <li> I am 23 years old and cannot say I&#x27;ve consistently washed and cared for my face at all.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and suffering from acne for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li> First, I used up the cleanser far faster than anything else</li>
            <li> I was ready to stop but decided to give it a little more time to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It all feels gentle on the skin, and the face lotion is nice a thick</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone with mild acne, but it didn&#x27;t totally get rid of my breakouts as well as Grandpa&#x27;s Thylox soap with Sulpher, which is what I use now.</li>
            <li> i had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> - I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of the natural ingredients, and I like most of their other products.</li>
            <li> Even though I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results, I know it can take a while for skin to clear up, I kept using the whole system until I ran out of cleanser.</li>
            <li> Usually once I finish a product I move on to something else, but this set is actually good enough to keep using.  </li>
            <li> Well I got this right before I took my act and my driving test on the same day</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected, Product is for dry skin to normal only which it did not work for me</li>
            <li> When it stopped useing it the pimples went away and got new ones.</li>
            <li> I about two weeks of use my skin already looked better than it did in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> It does smell a little minty however, that goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I also have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (it was making my skin very sensitive).</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and married.</li>
            <li> is not the best product to get :(</li>
            <li> their spot treatment is pretty good in my opinion but it still stinks like the rest of the products in this kit.</li>
            <li> Back in high school I tried some Burts facial products and found they made me oily, but given that I&#x27;m almost 30 now and dealing with light adult acne, I figured my skin has changed enough to give this line a try.</li>
            <li> so I finally went the all natural route with Lush products &amp; got some really positive results within in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of these Acne kits, Proactiv, Clean &amp; Clean, PanOxyl, Neutrogena, Clearasil, Aveeno, and even tried several PRESCRIBED Acne medications and kits and had so much frustration after time and time again seeing little to no results and an empty wallet!</li>
            <li> so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> Also,it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 13 year old daughter</li>
            <li> tried EVERYTHING from prescription to natural remedies and nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the ONLY product that dries out the blemish FAST.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old mom of 2</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the texture of the spot solution - it is kind of watery.</li>
            <li> I love the face that the product is almost 100% natural but that comes with the face that it&#x27;s slow the process of healing your acne problem.</li>
            <li> When I was in high school, I was lucky enough to not really struggle with acne.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and less noticeable, skin tone is more even, and I generally get far fewer blemishes than I once did.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works for people with very different skin than mine (which is definitely combination and sensitive), but it&#x27;s certainly not right for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for over a month now (washing my face 3 times daily, moisturizing 2 times daily, exfoliating 3 times/week, and using spot treatment in the evenings).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit, especially if you are someone who struggles with sensitive/combination skin like me!</li>
            <li> I have mild acne, and after a weeks use, I noticed little to no break outs.</li>
            <li> I was using Proactiv before and, although it helped a little, it made my skin super flaky and irritated, and the acne was still there.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer to clear up my patch of acne with Burt&#x27;s Bees, but the way the cleanser made my face feel was worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a deep down clean feel.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li> Late 30&#x27;s mom and teenage daughters all use this product and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of using acne products with so many chemicals, so one day i googled natural acne solutions and the burt&#x27;s bees acne kit showed up.</li>
            <li> and this is really the only skincare regime that I&#x27;ve bothered to purchase multiple times.  </li>
            <li> I was really stressed about having both of my tests back to back however</li>
            <li> I wanted a gentler, more natural product for my face, so I stopped using Proactiv and switched to cleansers with no medication, then when my acne got worse, I started using this kit.</li>
            <li> , my face was clean, my diet was healthy, no fired foods/vegatarian but still got bad acne on forehead and temples.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this kit, my adult acne had really been driving me crazy</li>
            <li> This helped to clear acne on my forehead and face just wish the acne spot treatment bottle was bigger.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that the acne gets worse before it gets better, so I kept on with the treatments.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get rid if my current acne it made it last longer, but it didn&#x27;t give me any new pimples.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very creamy, which I expected since there are no parabens or sulfates, but it just doesn&#x27;t spread very well and my face doesn&#x27;t feel particularly moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other stuff before nothing works as fast as this does.</li>
            <li> Also being a guy other acne stuff that you would buy smells very feminine</li>
            <li> It has really helped clear up my acne but hasn&#x27;t dried my face out.</li>
            <li> I admit I was a little worried when I used it the first couple of times.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty harsh regimen considering I stopped Proactiv b/c</li>
            <li> However, since Lush products are known to be pricey (but moderately affordable &amp; not at all ridiculously expensive like Clinique), I wanted to look for a much more affordable product.</li>
            <li> I had cystic acne right before I used it and the acne seemed to subside quicker than usual.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when I purchased this item, especially considering the other reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> It sinks in fast and definitely helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does come out of the bottle a little fast.</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled fine, but I saw no improvement after using twice daily for 2 months, if anything acne was worse at times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the spot treatment, it didn&#x27;t work for me, it had a really pungent smell, and it burned a little when I applied it to open pimples.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped tame my acne in the couple weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much soap to do the job so even though the bottle is small it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> and then all of a sudden my face got really dry</li>
            <li> I went through high school with very little breakouts.</li>
            <li> The lotion is a little thick for my liking, but not bad.</li>
            <li> If you were or are like me and tired of thinking you have to live with post-teen/young adult acne you MUST try this kit!</li>
            <li> Only a few days later I was already starting to notice the difference!</li>
            <li> I have pale, sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> I Have used this product for a long time I like the use of the Acne (burts bee), I have used other products but have come back to use this product</li>
            <li> Nearly all of the products I tried in the past were too harsh for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy the lip balm, hand lotion and other products, but this one is definitely not on my repeat purchase list.</li>
            <li> cleanser (step 1) seems to dry my face out until I moisturize with the lotion (step 2) and finish off with the spot treatment (step 3).</li>
            <li> I feel moisturized and not flaky and dry</li>
            <li> Also, single bottles of the cleanser at stores in my area were around $15</li>
            <li> I have tried some other harsh products, that also didn&#x27;t work for me, so I thought switching to something natural might be helpful, but not so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suppose to take at least a month or two to see results, so I&#x27;m hoping that by the time I&#x27;m off the Rx, my skin will be normal again.</li>
            <li> i am kind of disappointed of this product..</li>
            <li> The cleanser is really thin, but you still only need to use a dime size amount to get enough lather for your entire face so it will last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> If you have mild acne, this may work for you, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> I liked the lotion but the spot treatment, being liquid, was less of a spot treatment and more like rubbing a caustic liquid on my skin because it burnt, smelled horrible, and wouldn&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> (Neutrogena, Clearasil, Biore...etc.) &amp; spent a fortune on prescription gels just to get my acne under control.</li>
            <li> I was worried that my skin would dry out, but quite the opposite; I woke up looking like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> The salicylic acid in these products is minimal, so I&#x27;m not sure if there was enough to help me.  </li>
            <li> I dont think I would use any other.</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed, the acne has not been alleviated at all by the use of this product.  </li>
            <li> Look up other reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;please say this helped u so other see.</li>
            <li> Though all your other stuff away and just use this.</li>
            <li> It also dried my skin out too much, which then made the oiliness worse.</li>
            <li> so it has no perfume which make you feel uncomfortable for the first few days because of</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really gentle on the skin even if it has a slightly weird smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will develop scars or dark spots from it either</li>
            <li> Every other acne solution I tried dried me out a lot.</li>
            <li> They left my skin feeling oily, had an awful smell, &amp; caused more breakouts.</li>
            <li> My face felt smoother and refreshed and my acne is less and less</li>
            <li> Salicylic acid has never worked for me in the past, so I was a bit skeptical with receiving positive results.</li>
            <li> but I do get those stubborn little pimples or two on my chin and nose.</li>
            <li> and I have seen little progress.</li>
            <li> I may be the only one, but I was a little confused about how to apply the spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I expected better results from burt&#x27;s bees but this stuff is terrible.</li>
            <li> I just bought this stuff a few days ago</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks..</li>
            <li> and my breakouts came back worse then before.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after giving up my harsh 10% benzyl peroxide face wash</li>
            <li> It actually made my face worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After I stopped using my harsh cleanser, my acne came back even worse than it was before.</li>
            <li> When I went off the pill, I started to have pretty bad breakouts once a month.</li>
            <li> I had never had bad skin, even in my teen years, and I would only break out with a few pimples here and there.</li>
            <li> I have small patches of acne that break out infrequently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv in the past</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any more awful breakouts, no more peeling and flakiness, no more irritation.</li>
            <li> and I was sick of having to pay so much for products I felt worked, but were way too abrasive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Recently these have been getting worse, which is annoying because I am 25 years old.</li>
            <li> After that her face was so raw, red and horribly broken out, the very worse it has ever been.</li>
            <li> But when they do break out, it&#x27;s hard to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> When I have a bad breakout (I have PCOS and get adult cystic acne from time to time)</li>
            <li> while it didn&#x27;t work 100% for me at least I got favorable results.</li>
            <li> I was breaking out like crazy, tons of blackheads, giant pores, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had bad acne just when I was really stressed, and tired.</li>
            <li> never really sure if it this is the reason behind clearing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible acne by any means, but I could wash my face with regular soap and have the same results.</li>
            <li> Proactiv didn&#x27;t stop my breakouts, though, and sometimes they were so bad that you couldn&#x27;t tell that I was using an acne treatment twice a day, religiously.</li>
            <li> It was horrible and for the first time, I was embarrassed by my skin.</li>
            <li> Game over.</li>
            <li> In fact, may have made me break out worse.</li>
            <li> It may work for you but if your skin is like mine it may just make your breakouts worse.</li>
            <li> it was too harsh on my skin, but I was/am desperate.</li>
            <li> Sadly, once I stopped using Proactiv, my skin went haywire</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these products didn&#x27;t help with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work for my skin.</li>
            <li> Very thin and doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets the oil off of my face.  </li>
            <li> just made my acne worse and the pimples painful.</li>
            <li> The other acne treatment items in the kit were terrible!</li>
            <li> I started braking out really bad all over my face.</li>
            <li> She used it once and had a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad and</li>
            <li> so, I would never use that stuff  however, this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell bad, or feminine at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get bad break outs</li>
            <li> It may work well, but I would not want to risk it being as bad for anyone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> it works, hate the smell of it</li>
            <li> and I hate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold for life not a spot of acne on my face, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it works as soon as you apply it!</li>
            <li> Terrible!!</li>
            <li> Its awful and so embarassing.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, it did virtually nothing for my skin even after months of use.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am 23 years old and cannot say I&#x27;ve consistently washed and cared for my face at all. I&#x27;ve had whiteheads for years and finally thought I would do something about them so my chin area wouldn&#x27;t have that sandpaper-ey effect. I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for over a month now (washing my face 3 times daily, moisturizing 2 times daily, exfoliating 3 times/week, and using spot treatment in the evenings). After the first week I started getting inflamed pimples! I&#x27;ve heard that the acne gets worse before it gets better, so I kept on with the treatments. Now I&#x27;m throwing the whole lot in the bin because my acne is the wost it&#x27;s been in my whole life and there appears to be no reduction in the numbers of whiteheads. My face feels sore and I want to put a paper bag over my head whenever I go out in public. Terrible!! Game over.</li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for more than a month and the acne has cleared up dramatically. I had cystic acne right before I used it and the acne seemed to subside quicker than usual. I was using Proactiv right before I bought the kit and I was sick of having to pay so much for products I felt worked, but were way too abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser (step 1) seems to dry my face out until I moisturize with the lotion (step 2) and finish off with the spot treatment (step 3). I put the spot treatment on the areas I need it the most, but I have noticed the spot treatment works better when applied with a cottonpad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest though, I bought the Burt&#x27;s Bees clarifying toner and use it before I use step 2. Don&#x27;t know why BB would not include the toner in the kit, as it fits well into the regiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this kit once a day (at night) and so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last note - the kit seems to moisturize my face very well too! I feel moisturized and not flaky and dry - then again my skin seems to react WAY better to salycic acid than benzoyl peroxide, though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a Burt&#x27;s Bees product that I don&#x27;t like.  This is no exception.  I have small patches of acne that break out infrequently.  But when they do break out, it&#x27;s hard to get rid of it.  I&#x27;ve used Proactiv in the past and I do like that product also.  But it&#x27;s more expensive and I don&#x27;t like the idea of sending me the stuff when I don&#x27;t ask for it.  I realize that&#x27;s convenient for some.  It took a little longer to clear up my patch of acne with Burt&#x27;s Bees, but the way the cleanser made my face feel was worth it. It&#x27;s a deep down clean feel.  The cream is also very nice feeling.  Light weight, but it does a good job of keeping my face moisturized.  The spot treatment smells harsh, but since it&#x27;s all natural it&#x27;s not harsh at all.  I would definitely recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of the natural ingredients, and I like most of their other products. I thought it smelled fine, but I saw no improvement after using twice daily for 2 months, if anything acne was worse at times. Canceled my subscription.</li>
            <li> Received quickly. Great products!</li>
            <li> Late 30&#x27;s mom and teenage daughters all use this product and LOVE it. Natural product and very effective. Combined with a good diet we love how our skin looks right now after about a month of use!</li>
            <li> I love the Buts Bees cleanser.  It is gentle, yet cleans my acne/sensitive skin well without using harsh chemicals. The other acne treatment items in the kit were terrible! They left my skin feeling oily, had an awful smell, &amp; caused more breakouts. I continue to use the cleanser, as it is the best I have found, but still can&#x27;t find something to work on my combination acne/ sensitive skin. I would recommend buying the set because it is cheap if you want to give it a try, or if you can find a good deal on just the cleanser, that is the better choice.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of using acne products with so many chemicals, so one day i googled natural acne solutions and the burt&#x27;s bees acne kit showed up. So after reading all the positive reviews i thought that i should give it a chance. After one week i noticed that some of my acne was going away. but after 2-3 weeks i started to break out on places i never broke-out before,(cheek and chin). I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. i had high hopes. i don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really good product. I have mild acne, and after a weeks use, I noticed little to no break outs. Only thing is spot treatment really strong, burned my skin a couple of times. But over all good!!!</li>
            <li> I love the face that the product is almost 100% natural but that comes with the face that it&#x27;s slow the process of healing your acne problem.If you&#x27;re not in a rush,go for it. Also,it&#x27;s all natural so it has no perfume which make you feel uncomfortable for the first few days because of it&#x27;s smell.I love the moisturizer though.This is the first one ever that really moist your facel</li>
            <li> Did not help my acne. In fact, may have made me break out worse. I have pale, sensitive, combination skin. It may work for you but if your skin is like mine it may just make your breakouts worse.</li>
            <li> I have really stubborn acne around my chin and jawline, NOTHING seemed to work on it.  I just bought this stuff a few days ago and I&#x27;m already starting to see an improvement in the way my skin looks and feels.  The cleanser is really thin, but you still only need to use a dime size amount to get enough lather for your entire face so it will last quite a while.  The lotion is probably my favorite part of the kit.  I have combo/oily skin and this still doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy and gross.  I highly recommend this product!  And I&#x27;m not one that usually writes reviews for things, but I believe whole heartedly that this stuff might be my jewel!</li>
            <li> In the firs week, this product worked great. My face has shown evident acne reduction. However, the spot treatment used up fast. I ran out of it within two weeks. The product smells nice and its moisturizer was good. I believe the product is good for mild acne. However, if you have severe acne like me, you should find something stronger.</li>
            <li> Both for my daughter. Great product for her. Doesn&#x27;t bother her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I was in high school, I was lucky enough to not really struggle with acne. Then I got on the pill and, while it had no effect on my skin, it made me absolutely bonkers! When I went off the pill, I started to have pretty bad breakouts once a month. Recently these have been getting worse, which is annoying because I am 25 years old. I also have VERY sensitive skin. This kit has been great so far. I was worried about the \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; being very drying, but it is not at all. It&#x27;s really helped tame my acne in the couple weeks I&#x27;ve been using it. My skin tone also looks more even. I highly recommend this kit, especially if you are someone who struggles with sensitive/combination skin like me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already reviewed the moisturizer and cleanser separately--I think they work great and this is really the only skincare regime that I&#x27;ve bothered to purchase multiple times.  Usually once I finish a product I move on to something else, but this set is actually good enough to keep using.  The moisturizer is non-greasy, but moisturizes well.  My face feels nice, clean, and free of grease after using the cleanser.  After using this product for many months, I can really see a difference in how my skin looks.  My pores are smaller and less noticeable, skin tone is more even, and I generally get far fewer blemishes than I once did.    This particular set on Amazon is a good value.  I could do without the spot treatment though.  It really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Plain old tea tree oil is far more effective for taking care of blemishes.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product that works well for me. I cannot say that it will work well for all skin types, etc. I especially enjoyed the moisturizer. It sinks in fast and definitely helps with dry skin. This is the best price I could find for these, in store or online! I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I Have used this product for a long time I like the use of the Acne (burts bee), I have used other products but have come back to use this product it is one of the very best, Acne product for my face that works real well and good. I dont think I would use any other.</li>
            <li> The gel cleanser feels more like water to me.  Very thin and doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets the oil off of my face.  The moisturizer is very good, but smells funky.  The spot treatment has worked quite well for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of these Acne kits, Proactiv, Clean &amp; Clean, PanOxyl, Neutrogena, Clearasil, Aveeno, and even tried several PRESCRIBED Acne medications and kits and had so much frustration after time and time again seeing little to no results and an empty wallet! Finally, I had enough and went out on a limb and bought Burts Bees Acne two week kit. I was full of doubt and about to except the fact that I will always have Acne (im 22 now and have suffered from the condition ever since i was 14) Only a few days later I was already starting to notice the difference! The biggest change I saw RIGHT AWAY was the redness was disappearing! And after two weeks I have no new break outs and can see a HUGE difference in my skin! If you were or are like me and tired of thinking you have to live with post-teen/young adult acne you MUST try this kit! Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when I purchased this item, especially considering the other reviews I read.  However, I was disappointed, the acne has not been alleviated at all by the use of this product.  I have tried some other harsh products, that also didn&#x27;t work for me, so I thought switching to something natural might be helpful, but not so.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks.. and yet it doesnt show any improvement.. i am kind of disappointed of this product..</li>
            <li> I went through high school with very little breakouts. Now I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and married. When my husband deployed my eating/sleeping habits changed along with my stress level. I started braking out really bad all over my face. This went on for months with me trying a ton of store products that didn&#x27;t work. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and was excited when I came across this kit. It worked really well for about 2 weeks and then all of a sudden my face got really dry and my breakouts came back worse then before. I discontinued this product right away. Guess it just wasn&#x27;t for me. It did smell good though.</li>
            <li> So far, so good with this. I bought it for my 13 year old daughter and she likes the product and sees a difference. I think she&#x27;d be better off to use it more regularly, but hey, that&#x27;s not the products&#x27; issue. Just hers.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing acne wash! You don&#x27;t need very much soap to do the job so even though the bottle is small it goes a long way! It has really helped clear up my acne but hasn&#x27;t dried my face out. Every other acne solution I tried dried me out a lot. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> As much I wanted this to work, it just didn&#x27;t. I started using this product after giving up my harsh 10% benzyl peroxide face wash (it was making my skin very sensitive). I wanted something natural and gentler and this seemed like a great fit. After I stopped using my harsh cleanser, my acne came back even worse than it was before. It was horrible and for the first time, I was embarrassed by my skin. I bought this hoping it would help. I liked that the cleanser was kind of thin, almost watery, so it rinsed off easily, but I did not like the smell. It also dried my skin out too much, which then made the oiliness worse. I&#x27;m not a fan of the spot treatment, it didn&#x27;t work for me, it had a really pungent smell, and it burned a little when I applied it to open pimples. I may be the only one, but I was a little confused about how to apply the spot treatment. I just used a q-tip, but I felt like I was wasting it. Whenever I was using the lotion and the cleanser together, my face would get really shiny and oily, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that was because the cleanser was drying my skin out. I do like the lotion and I still use it at night. Since I&#x27;ve switched to a gentler cleanser, the lotion has just the right balance of moisturizing and treatment. Even though I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results, I know it can take a while for skin to clear up, I kept using the whole system until I ran out of cleanser. That&#x27;s when I finally gave up; my skin had not improved at all. Despite all this, I still love every other Burt&#x27;s Bees product I&#x27;ve ever used and I love that Burt&#x27;s Bees offers natural products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Maybe not for me, it made me break up in ways I hadn&#x27;t imagined before using it. It seems like the simpler the product, like cetaphyl, the better. \\&quot;Acne\\&quot; products give me acne. I expected better results from burt&#x27;s bees but this stuff is terrible.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected, Product is for dry skin to normal only which it did not work for me</li>
            <li> This is a good product for general face washing and a good starter kit to get your skin care routine going. The face wash lathers really well and makes you feel clean. The lotion is a little thick for my liking, but not bad. I also think it should have come with a toner instead of the spot treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement with my acne and I used this for about 2 months. I wanted a gentler, more natural product for my face, so I stopped using Proactiv and switched to cleansers with no medication, then when my acne got worse, I started using this kit. The salicylic acid in these products is minimal, so I&#x27;m not sure if there was enough to help me.  I ended up having to go to a dermatologist to help me with my acne issues. I had never had bad skin, even in my teen years, and I would only break out with a few pimples here and there. Since this had always been the case, I figured I didn&#x27;t really need harsh acne medications in my cleansers. Sadly, once I stopped using Proactiv, my skin went haywire and I was breaking out more than I ever have; to the point where my family and friends were asking what the heck happened to my nice skin! Nothing was working, so I saw a dermatologist who has put me on antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide gel &amp; retin-A micro gel. This is a pretty harsh regimen considering I stopped Proactiv b/c it was too harsh on my skin, but I was/am desperate. It&#x27;s suppose to take at least a month or two to see results, so I&#x27;m hoping that by the time I&#x27;m off the Rx, my skin will be normal again. In the future, I hope to use more natural, gentle solutions once my skin clears, but we&#x27;ll see. If you have mild acne, this may work for you, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get rid if my current acne it made it last longer, but it didn&#x27;t give me any new pimples. When it stopped useing it the pimples went away and got new ones.</li>
            <li> Great product, smooth silky skin with noticeable clearer skin in days.  Three step process cleans and clears without drying out.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter. She used it once and had a bad reaction to it. I purchased this kit because this is a good company. Product was just not for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now; at first I saw results, my acne bumps started to clear a bit THEN they started popping out more  I started getting breakout where I never had before - like over my eye brows and to the side of my face. I have not changed my diet or done anything different. I will be returning to Proactiv - while it didn&#x27;t work 100% for me at least I got favorable results.</li>
            <li> This stuff isnt anything special. works ok some of the time. never really sure if it this is the reason behind clearing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I found the magic answer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zinc picolinate its a vitamin. Look up other reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just putting it here becuase it helped me alot my skins pretty much perfect after 4 days of taking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doing everything right, my face was clean, my diet was healthy, no fired foods/vegatarian but still got bad acne on forehead and temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take zinc once a day with a meal. its amazing. no bad side effects, not an invasive pill just a viatimin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please say this helped u so other see.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and I LOVE what it has done for my skin. My skin is clearer, smoother, and just overall better than it was before. I love the smell and the products don&#x27;t sting like some that contain salicylic acid. My only complaint is the texture of the spot solution - it is kind of watery.</li>
            <li> I had perfect skin all through my teens and suddenly in my early 20s I was breaking out like crazy, tons of blackheads, giant pores, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried EVERYTHING from prescription to natural remedies and nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this around three weeks and my skin is beautiful and my pores have shrunk and it&#x27;s seriously amazing. It&#x27;s super gentle but nothing else has worked. I ran out of the spot treatment quickly because I had an intense breakout, so I haven&#x27;t been using it. But I find that I don&#x27;t need it anymore and just the cleanser and moisturizer are working beautifully. Seriously so happy. I just wash morning and night and my skin finally looks like it did before!</li>
            <li> It actually made my face worse. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Tea tree oil works better as a spot treatment than the one they give you in this kit and the moisturizer leaves a waxy feel on your face.</li>
            <li> Helps my kids with all their hormonal breakouts.  Burts Bees by far is their favorite face regime product. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> As someone struggling with acne for over 20 years, I feel that I have good authority to rate this product as there is nothing for acne that I haven&#x27;t tried. This thing works, and works beautifully. I was using Proactiv before and, although it helped a little, it made my skin super flaky and irritated, and the acne was still there. Still, it was the best thing that I had tried, so I used it for years. Proactiv didn&#x27;t stop my breakouts, though, and sometimes they were so bad that you couldn&#x27;t tell that I was using an acne treatment twice a day, religiously. Proactiv customer service told me to try the super strength formula, which didn&#x27;t help either.     I finally gave up and decided to try something natural after reading a couple of good reviews for Burt&#x27;s Bees acne products. Boy, am I glad I did. I about two weeks of use my skin already looked better than it did in a long, long time. I haven&#x27;t had any more awful breakouts, no more peeling and flakiness, no more irritation. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it&#x27;s invisible (Proactiv has a funky odor and makes your skin shiny). I am not using the hydrating lotion, though, because my skin is really oily and I the lotion was too much for my skin type - not that it gave me acne, but it did make my skin feel \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;, so I stopped using it. Now I simply wash my face morning and night with the cleaning product, and when I see that I am about to have a breakout I use the spot treatment. The spot treatment doesn&#x27;t have the best smell in the world, but it works like never I tried before.    With this regimen, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since starting using the products. Also, since I am not using the hydrating lotion, I am going to be able to save some money by buying the products separately - instead of buying the kit, I&#x27;ll buy only the two products I use. I am so happy that Burt&#x27;s Bee does sells the products separately.     The extra nice effect is that it seems that my skin tone is becoming more even after using the products. Proactiv left me full of dark spots but this is doing a pretty nice job in getting rid of them.    Bottom line - I highly recommend these products. My next step is to buy the scrub and all I can say is that I hope this keeps working!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. However, since I began using this kit in February 2015, my acne has actually worsened. The cleanser is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. It does come out of the bottle a little fast. The spot treatment has a very strong scent and sometimes it feels like my skin is burning.  The lotion feels very...strange. It&#x27;s not very creamy, which I expected since there are no parabens or sulfates, but it just doesn&#x27;t spread very well and my face doesn&#x27;t feel particularly moisturized. Overall, I&#x27;ve used many Burt&#x27;s Bees products that work very well, but this acne kit is not one of them.</li>
            <li> After using proactive for years I realized I needed a change. Unfortunately these products didn&#x27;t help with my breakouts. They just don&#x27;t seem strong enough.</li>
            <li> I will preface this by saying that I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and will continue to use their other products, however this product was not for me.  The smell was the most off putting.  It reminded me Pledge, the furniture polish.  That is not a smell that I would like to have on my face. It was absolutely overwhelming.  The cleanser didn&#x27;t make my face feel clean either, just more oily.  I will continue to buy the lip balm, hand lotion and other products, but this one is definitely not on my repeat purchase list.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this kit, my adult acne had really been driving me crazy and I really didn&#x27;t want to go to the dermatologist to waste my time and money. My mom had gotten me the Burt&#x27;s Bees Purifying Gel cleanser to try out and I saw a difference and felt my skin clearing up after finishing the bottle. I switched over to the Soap Bark and Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream to try it out and my face started breaking out again. I guess it was too oily for my skin type so I decided to go back to the gel cleanser and came across this kit on amazon, I gave it a shot and I&#x27;m so happy! This is definitely my go-to line for my acne from here on out.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great on your skin.  I have pregnancy back-ne and it seemed to help a lot right away.  I bought the toner as well, and wish it would come in the pack.  It all feels gentle on the skin, and the face lotion is nice a thick so I like to use it at night but not in the morning.</li>
            <li> it works, hate the smell of it but it does work. the only product i would care about is that spot treatment. their spot treatment is pretty good in my opinion but it still stinks like the rest of the products in this kit. if you can get pass the smell then it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Ive struggled with acne for many many years and im always trying to find something that will help. The face wash and the spot treatment are ok but for sensitive or acne prone skin I would not use the lotion. It broke me out. It is very heavy and greasy. If you have acne like I do this is not the best product to get :(</li>
            <li> Because I just began to use the goods, the effect is not obvious. But it can keep my face moisture well. I think it&#x27;s wrthy buying.</li>
            <li> This helped to clear acne on my forehead and face just wish the acne spot treatment bottle was bigger.  Better to buy through amazon than at store.</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees products.  This face wash system is great.  I also bought a toner and it all goes great together!</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I love natural ingredients and I enjoy Burts&#x27; make-up and chapsticks. Back in high school I tried some Burts facial products and found they made me oily, but given that I&#x27;m almost 30 now and dealing with light adult acne, I figured my skin has changed enough to give this line a try. I guess if your skin just doesn&#x27;t like a certain line of products, it never will!  I tried the system (plus toner) for three weeks, changing the amount of product used from once to twice a day midway through.I was worried that my skin would dry out, but quite the opposite; I woke up looking like an oil slick. I could literally run my hand across my forehead and my hand would emerge shiny and moist. Ick! I&#x27;m sure this product works for people with very different skin than mine (which is definitely combination and sensitive), but it&#x27;s certainly not right for me.</li>
            <li> This kit didn&#x27;t help with my skin. I don&#x27;t have terrible acne by any means, but I could wash my face with regular soap and have the same results.</li>
            <li> This pack is so affordable!! And it works so well! Never have I been able to put lotion on my face, and open my eyes, and NOT have it burn somewhat! You can slather the lotion all over your face; it&#x27;s fine for the most sensitive skin and eyes! The spot treatment truly does work overnight to reduce pimples! I LOVE this set!!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and suffering from acne for the first time ever.  I tried Burts Bees and it worked pretty good for my acne.  I didn&#x27;t see a lot of benefit from the spot treatment, but the cleanser and lotion were a daily use for me.  I would recommend this to someone with mild acne, but it didn&#x27;t totally get rid of my breakouts as well as Grandpa&#x27;s Thylox soap with Sulpher, which is what I use now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest I&#x27;ve never had bad acne just when I was really stressed, and tired. Well I got this right before I took my act and my driving test on the same day it works like a charm! I was really stressed about having both of my tests back to back however, this took care of all of my problems. I&#x27;ve tried other stuff before nothing works as fast as this does. Also being a guy other acne stuff that you would buy smells very feminine so, I would never use that stuff  however, this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell bad, or feminine at all. It does smell a little minty however, that goes away pretty quickly. I&#x27;m sold for life not a spot of acne on my face, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it works as soon as you apply it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really grateful for this product. My skin started breaking out when I was in 4th grade &amp; my acne continued to follow me into my 20s. I have tried almost every popular &amp;#34;acne-solution&amp;#34; drugstore brand on the market (Neutrogena, Clearasil, Biore...etc.) &amp; spent a fortune on prescription gels just to get my acne under control. Nearly all of the products I tried in the past were too harsh for my sensitive skin so I finally went the all natural route with Lush products &amp; got some really positive results within in a couple of months. However, since Lush products are known to be pricey (but moderately affordable &amp; not at all ridiculously expensive like Clinique), I wanted to look for a much more affordable product. Salicylic acid has never worked for me in the past, so I was a bit skeptical with receiving positive results. But! I&#x27;m sooo glad I was wrong about Burt&#x27;s Bees. I finally found an acne-solution product that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with the maximum spot-treatment cream from Burt&#x27;s Bees when I have stubborn breakouts. Personally, I have experienced nothing but positive results since I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> The lotion that comes with this set makes my skin feel tacky for the whole day.  The face wash did nothing to help my acne, even in combination with the toner (bought separately).  However, I would recommend the spot treatment, it works like a charm and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> I have been using the blemish treatment for a while. I LOVE IT. When I have a bad breakout (I have PCOS and get adult cystic acne from time to time) this is the ONLY product that dries out the blemish FAST.  I love it! Its great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old mom of 2 and I&#x27;ve struggles with acne since I was about 19. Its awful and so embarassing. I&#x27;ve tried every product and everything just kind of works but I never notice a huge improvement. Then I found this and I loove it. My face felt smoother and refreshed and my acne is less and less and I feel so much better and confident about myself. I still get occasional break outs (mostly around that time of the month) but they are not nearly as bad as before. I would reccomend this to anyone. And its natural which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin ever. I don&#x27;t get bad break outs but I do get those stubborn little pimples or two on my chin and nose. I&#x27;ve used this since my freshman year of highschool and I&#x27;m a senior. Burt&#x27;s bees has never failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the people saying it hasn&#x27;t worked. Even tho we have different skin types I bet you this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bet you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touch your face&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t change your pillow case often&lt;br /&gt;Let your greasy hair touch your face&lt;br /&gt;Get greasy food on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Never wash your hands&lt;br /&gt;Touch your hair then touch your face&lt;br /&gt;Use to much makeup or use un cleaned makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t blame this product for not working if you aren&#x27;t taking all the steps you need to be taking. You can&#x27;t rely souly on the product to fix your problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But being the girl that&#x27;s allergic to everything I can tell you it&#x27;s really gentle on the skin even if it has a slightly weird smell.</li>
            <li> I admit I was a little worried when I used it the first couple of times. I already had a bit of acne on my face and once I started using this product I began to develop more. I was ready to stop but decided to give it a little more time to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was glad I did because after 2 weeks my skin looks amazing. Great for people with dry skin :)</li>
            <li> It dries my skin out, I&#x27;ve been using it as directed for 2 weeks and I have seen little progress. The spot treatment works but it burns. I don&#x27;t know if I will develop scars or dark spots from it either</li>
            <li> This stuff really really works.  I would recommend to anyone who has acne problems!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this for my daughter after we could no longer find Equates version of Proactive. The first week this product was amazing, my daughters skin was so clear. After that her face was so raw, red and horribly broken out, the very worse it has ever been. I would not recommend this to anyone. It may work well, but I would not want to risk it being as bad for anyone else.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work for my skin. I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect acne solution for my skin for over 8 years and still haven&#x27;t found the one. The smell of the product is good. I feel like this acne treatment just made my acne worse and the pimples painful. Every persons skin is different though, I&#x27;ll keep searching.</li>
            <li> Great price and packaging. Arrived earlier than anticipated. Outstanding product. I&#x27;m a big Burt&#x27;s fan.</li>
            <li> It made my face OILY and I hate it. It didnt even work!</li>
            <li> Didnt work for my skin</li>
            <li> I like the face wash and moisturizer but the acne spot remover didn&#x27;t work at all. I used it for months and thought I would give it a try after reading reviews. However, I did not see any results. I really like the moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> I had read such great things about this product and I was so excited to try it; I was pregnant at the time so the appeal of an all natural product was huge for me. First, I used up the cleanser far faster than anything else and it was so runny that I couldn&#x27;t contain it in my hands or on my face. I liked the lotion but the spot treatment, being liquid, was less of a spot treatment and more like rubbing a caustic liquid on my skin because it burnt, smelled horrible, and wouldn&#x27;t stay in place (of course). Worst of all, it did virtually nothing for my skin even after months of use. Also, single bottles of the cleanser at stores in my area were around $15 so I was spending a lot of money and getting no results.</li>
            <li> All natural and effective is all you need to know. Though all your other stuff away and just use this. Results are fast and you will be thankful because i know i was!!!</li>
