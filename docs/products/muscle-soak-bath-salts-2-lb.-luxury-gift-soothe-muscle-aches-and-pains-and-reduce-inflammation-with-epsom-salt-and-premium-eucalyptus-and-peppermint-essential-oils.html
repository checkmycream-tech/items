    <ol>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>and it was absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>That means San Francisco Salt Company has chosen a nearly perfect plastic package that keeps all the oils in with the salts until it is time to use them.</li>
            <li>come in a very attractive, resealable package.  </li>
            <li>Felt great after soaking in it for twenty minutes and for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li>The package is very attractive and makes for a perfect gift type item.</li>
            <li>It also makes a beautiful relaxing decoration piece to the apothecary jars surrounding the tub.</li>
            <li>Beautiful packaging, and quite a bit of product.</li>
            <li>It smells delightful - nice peppermint scent.</li>

            <li>Again, it has a great smell.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I tried this, and it felt great, plus the effects of the peppermint aroma wafting up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great foot soak product.</li>
            <li>I tried this version, and it smells great, with a sinus opening and invigorating eucalyptus scent with a touch of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell was great and she had just done a 18 mile run the day before and seemed to think the salts helped.  </li>
            <li>It felt great on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I happy to say, that for (about) the millionth time I am happy that I listened to my wife and accepted this product for  review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What a great product -</li>
            <li>To relax at the end of my day I run a very warm bath and add in about a handful of the Muscle Soak Bath Salts</li>
            <li>Epsom salts are wonderful for achy muscles, and this one makes it even better by adding eucalyptus and peppermint.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product and would make a wonderful gift for an athlete or any hard-working person in your life who might enjoy a muscle soak.</li>
            <li>We deserve to feel the best and be the healthiest we can, and a soak in \\&quot;Muscle Soak\\&quot; is a very special treat in achieving this goal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the combination of mint and eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>We found the San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s bath salts, including these epsom salts lightly scented with eucalyptus and peppermint oils, to be among the best we have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried combining it with body wash to create a scrub, but it disintegrates too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>A lengthy soak in these wonderful salts lifts the tiredness, relieves the aching, and leaves my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li>A nice, pleasant scent that also helps with the relaxation aspect of the salts.</li>
            <li>Excellent bath salts, great smell, very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>, let me say that I am absolutely in love with the scent of the Muscle Soak Bath Salts, they smell of Peppermint and Eucalyptus in the most perfect way, which makes me feel like I&#x27;m giving myself a luxurious spa treatment from the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simply delicious, fresh aroma.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li>It also comes nicely packaged in an attractive, sturdy plastic pouch that has an interesting feature: an aroma valve.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Will order more soon!</li>
            <li>It was better than drugs!</li>
            <li>But it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I would wear this scent as a perfume, and it would probably be amazing since I do work in a spa.</li>
            <li>The bath smells so nice and will increase your water temperature to stay warm longer-very relaxing.</li>
            <li>reminds me of how much I liked taking baths and of the therapeutic value of just relaxing in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It is time to revitalize and pamper yourself with a nice relaxing and therapeutic salt</li>
            <li>My wife and I liked them all</li>
            <li>My wife and I liked them all</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received an evaluation bag of Muscle Soak Bath Salts for evaluation and an honest review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a shower kind of guy.</li>
            <li>I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.r.</li>
            <li>I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.</li>
            <li>Nice touch!&lt;br</li>
            <li>the San Francisco Salts Muscle Soak bath is a very easy recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then they want some of their own :).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a shower person than a bath person, but the muscle soak bath salts are a nice product for showering as well as for tub baths.</li>
            <li>They dissolves quickly, creates a pleasant scent that&#x27;s noticeable without being overwhelming, and the result is just so nice on sore muscles.</li>
            <li>However, once you add it to a warm bath, the scent is very mild and the peppermint doesn&#x27;t cause any tingling.</li>
            <li>It dissolved nicely and the minty fragrance filled the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Making sure all the kids were in bed, I got in the bath and almost melted with the decadence.</li>
            <li>look forward to the next time I can slip away and indulge in this wonderful treat!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some was lost during transit.</li>
            <li>I love these brands of salt baths.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I was able to save 98% of it</li>
            <li>I definitely am quite impressed with the San Francisco Salt Company version.</li>
            <li>The stickiness of the top of the bag fades over time.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with the product and the price.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>what more can you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of the most relaxing bath salts I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a winning product for bath salt users, as were all bath salt products we have tried from this company.</li>
            <li>It made my soak more luxurious and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak to all the magical benefits that some people are espousing about.</li>
            <li>me, it&#x27;s an incredibly satisfying, armoatherapy, soaking bath experience that leaves me feeling relaxed and at ease with the world.</li>
            <li>They are made of Epsom salts, which is mostly magnesium sulfate.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what it was going to be like, but it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this, and have recommended it to people.&lt;br /&gt;[The</li>
            <li>/&gt;The aroma is not perfumed, but earthy and mellow (eucalyptus and peppermint); not pungent or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>and while I did receive it for reviewing purposes we will be buying more of the Muscle Soak both for ourselves and as gifts for our friends.  </li>
            <li>San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s \\&quot;Muscle Soak\\&quot; is a many wondrous thing.</li>
            <li>a licensed Esthetician, I am very familiar with the benefits of using Epsom Salts for the body.</li>
            <li>A good hot bath with a couple of handfuls of this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not much for baths, but this was just wonderful -</li>
            <li>I would have to say that this product is super excellent for someone who works out, such as myself.</li>
            <li>It has a great (and all natural) scent of mint and eucalyptus - that is both sweet and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing to remember back to my childhood when everyone knew the benefits of Epsom salts in a bath to relax, for use to exfoliate your skin and feet and as a good soak to remove toxins and even soak an injured joint or cut to help reduce infection.  </li>
            <li>Dissolves quickly in both cool and warm</li>
            <li>In order to get the full benefit of the epsom salts in the bath, it would take more than the handful suggested in the directions.  </li>
            <li>As for the salt itself, it&#x27;s fine while not being too powdery.</li>
            <li>I let my daughter take two handfuls to mix around in the bath before she got in, and she said everything felt fine.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent and was great after a long week of weightlifting.</li>
            <li>But there&#x27;s nothing I love better at the end of the day than taking a long soak with bath salts and a good book.</li>
            <li>You have to be very careful with bath salts, because in my experience, many of the products are too strong and your bathroom ends up smelling like vaporub, and it isn&#x27;t the most pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>You put two large handfuls of Muscle Soak Bath Salt into a warm bath and then soak for 20 minutes for a therapy bath.  </li>
            <li>The scents are all amazing, I love how your skin feels during and after the bath, silky soft.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that our water bill is going up because of taking more baths instead of showers but it is well worth the time to relax and enjoy life.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that our water bill is going up because of taking more baths instead of showers but it is well worth the time to relax and enjoy life.&lt;br</li>
            <li>personally am a huge bath taker because I find it relaxing, but for the days that I just don&#x27;t have time I do take showers.</li>
            <li>personally am a huge bath taker because I find it relaxing, but for the days that I just don&#x27;t have time I do take showers.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to enjoy a soak yet.</li>
            <li>Now give me a nice glass of Scotch, and I could spend way too much time in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li>It works nicely providing a gentle scrub and massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will gently exfoliate your feet, and the scent will fill your shower for that nice aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This will gently exfoliate your feet, and the scent will fill your shower for that nice aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After a nice 30 soak you can rinse and get ready for a night in the town or hit the hay.</li>
            <li>The San Francisco Salt Muscle Soak is a fantastic additional to any bath.</li>
            <li>Until the bath salts dissolved, they had a mild exfoliating effect, and the peppermint scent was very pleasant, almost exactly like the smell when you open a tin of Altoids</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like strong scents and this one was just right for me - not too strong yet noticeable.</li>
            <li>They dissolve very easily, and I found the bath very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Francisco Salt Company bath salts are of amazing high quality for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>But every so often, mostly when I just ache all over, I&#x27;ll take a long hot soak because the heat has great thearapeutic benefit to my sore and achy</li>
            <li>In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been making my own bath salts for my husband for some time using sea salt and essential oils, and the peppermint and eucalyptus blend has been his favorite for years.</li>
            <li>Slipping into the warm water with the armoas coming off the water is like a spa experience in your own bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I can tell you is that this product is first class in all regards... from the website of the company, to the beautiful packaging to the purity of the product and judicious use of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I used around a quarter cup of salt and the smell was exactly right, strong.</li>
            <li>It has a nice minty smell but that&#x27;s pretty much it</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re an athlete or just suffer with muscle aches like so many do, you may be interested to learn that magnesium helps to relieve those muscle aches and can be absorbed through your skin.  </li>
            <li>ran a full bath of almost-hot water and added about a cup of the salts.</li>
            <li>I also have their lavender product, and they both are equally good for different frames of mind.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>and I did not want to do anything but get a good night&#x27;s rest, which is something that I lack since starting my business.</li>
            <li>, amp that up with a handful of this Muscle Soak Bath Salts by San Francisco Salt Company and you&#x27;ll be in a place of true bliss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And I&#x27;m excited about using sea salt in the bath because it contains additional minerals which can be absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and food seller.</li>
            <li>So you get a double bonus - a body that feels better and a healthy sleep cycle.  </li>
            <li>but it still quickly dissolves in your tub.  </li>
            <li>, I take a quick shower to remove residual salt from my body.</li>
            <li>and it leaves your skin feeling super</li>
            <li>I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of the product.]</li>
            <li>There is a nice clear plastic window to see the pretty salt crystals.</li>
            <li>One of them is a 10 minute hot bath every night really helps feel and sleep better.</li>
            <li>package for this product is beautiful - nice enough to give as a gift to someone who needs a little pampering.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used different types of Epsom salts over the years, and while they&#x27;ve all worked well for the most part, this kind from San Francisco Bath Salt Company has helped it clear up to the nth degree.</li>
            <li>The salts also worked great on callouses , dead skin, etc, so now my feet are soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy how the scent of these bath salts gives me an added aromatherapy treatment, and it has really helped me with my congestion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the bath salts and they make my skin so soft?  </li>
            <li>Even a short soak at the end of the day can nicely relax you for sleep.</li>
            <li>Magnesium Sulfate can be absorbed into the skin and it is beneficial for you to detoxify your body.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re immediately aware of this awesome yet not overwhelming smell, that for me is intensely relaxing.</li>
            <li>It melted easily into the warm running water, the smell was slightly medicinal, but still pleasing.</li>
            <li>Somehow they get just the right combination of aroma balance.  </li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t like mint taste, I found the bath smelling slightly minty rather pleasant.</li>
            <li>scent in the bag is very strong which I do like, but it can be reminiscent of cough drops for some people because of the eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>I hauled it over to the big claw foot at the very first opportunity and we&#x27;ve been enjoying it ever since.  </li>
            <li>I also use these bath salts mixed in with a little of my body wash to exfoliate my body as needed, I especially love to use this on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also use these bath salts mixed in with a little of my body wash to exfoliate my body as needed, I especially love to use this on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use bath salts frequently for a good, long soak, and my wife does so even more frequently.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy baths, and especially is you enjoy Epsom baths</li>
            <li>I live in a great big Victorian house that, like many in New England, has been divided into a number of smaller apartments.  </li>
            <li>Because the salts are so soluble, it was a very gentle, massaging scrub.</li>
            <li>The smell of eucalyptus and peppermint is amazing, and you can even smell it when the bag is closed.</li>
            <li>and I love them all the same.</li>
            <li>First, the packaging.</li>
            <li>I was sent a review copy of this muscle soak salt by the San Francisco Salt Company, and will definitely buy more when I&#x27;m finished with this bag.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to trying their other products soon, and buying more of this!</li>
            <li>salt dissolved instantly in hot water.</li>
            <li>The samples worked their magic on us and we plan to use them in the future as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first photo shows salt in my hand, you can see the size and texture of the salt grains.</li>
            <li>I also found that if I have a migraine a hot soak help as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (as opposed to a hot bath without salts).</li>
            <li>first sensation comes when you grab the bag of salts and get a whiff of the eucalyptis and peppermint oil that escapes through the \\&quot;Aroma Valve.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>You know exactly what you will be using on your body.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Like many of those apartments, mine didn&#x27;t come with a bathtub, only a shower.  </li>
            <li>I put a cup of Muscle Soak Salts in a hot tub and soaked for twenty minutes or so.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The salts dissolve easily in hot water</li>
            <li>At first I was going to decline the opportunity to review these salt baths, but I mentioned them to my wife and she wanted to give them a try.</li>
            <li>I bought these salts due to all the amazing reviews I read.</li>
            <li>is pure Magnesium Sulfate (Epsom Salt) that quickly dissolves in warm or hot water and helps to relax stiff and sore muscles and relive your aches and pains.  </li>
            <li>I had to wait several weeks to have a free evening, but it was worth the anticipation and waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The magnesium found in it is absorbed through the skin, benefiting us by fighting osteoporosis and high blood pressure.  </li>
            <li>I have to be honest and say that after three times of having used them, I don&#x27;t really feel any of the &amp;#34;extraordinary&amp;#34; sensations that other people wrote about.</li>
            <li>long, steamy hot shower before going to bed is one of those little luxuries that I love, and the bath salts added a nice touch to the enjoyment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I squeeze the package ever so slightly, there is a nice whiff of peppermint aroma.</li>
            <li>After a bath we found that our skin was super soft...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in reading about the benefits of using sea salt or essential oil in your bath, do a quick internet search for \\&quot;Mark&#x27;s Daily Apple\\&quot; and \\&quot;how to take a better bath\\&quot; for links to some scientific studies that show the benefits of bathing with this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The instructions say to use two large handfuls in a bath.</li>
            <li>Either way, certain to not disappoint.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t really feel like it does much to sore muscles.</li>
            <li>I love making bath salts and have a wide range of aromas on hand to play with.</li>
            <li>I alternate between these and enjoy both.  </li>
            <li>I can tell you about this product, as it&#x27;s something you really need to try for yourself.</li>
            <li>Get a small bag first just to sample it, but if you&#x27;re happy, go ahead and order a big one.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine using that much.</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus and peppermint scent is clearly noticeable, and I could even distinctly smell each.</li>
            <li>I take a bath every night, and the smell of the eucalyptus and mint combo is really relaxing.</li>
            <li>smell is absolutely divine, but these bath salts come with a bonus.  </li>
            <li>really can</li>
            <li>This product is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m now healed, I do feel much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t use these within a few weeks, get a clamp of some kind to hold it shut.</li>
            <li>In the future, I will buy my epsom salt in bulk and add my own organic essential oil.</li>
            <li>Only giving two stars because the scent isn&#x27;t any stronger or better than the old standby salts.  </li>
            <li>The oils are a nice balance of eucalyptus and menthol or a wintergreen type smell, with a heavy emphasis on peppermint.</li>
            <li>My trips to the tub are far and few between, maybe 3 or 4 a year in a good year.</li>
            <li>Made with all natural ingredients and scented with eucalyptus and peppermint essential oils, these bath salts are fine grained and dissolve readily in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that - the Muscle Soak bath actually does everything that it claims and more it provides a super relaxing bath</li>
            <li>The fragrances are nice and not overwhelming and besides the therapeutic value that you are getting with the salt bath</li>
            <li>package is absolutely gorgeous - the blue is very similar to Tiffany blue.</li>
            <li>WOW, it really works!</li>
            <li>and she is lucky enough to have a huge old claw foot, big enough and deep enough to drown in, so every now and again when I really want a good soak I zip around to visit and spend some time in her tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It really is very well dosed to give just the right scent for deep relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>more than a plain old soak in hot water would have.</li>
            <li>I add in a little more of the Muscle</li>
            <li>After a long day at work there is nothing I love more than taking a relaxing hot bath, and I always love to add a little something extra to my water, and lately it&#x27;s been the San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s Muscle Soak Bath Salts.</li>
            <li>The salts made the water soft and silky, and the mint and eucalyptus in the steam gently opened my sinuses and lungs.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I had a great night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>love how easily this dissolves, how smooth and highly fragranced the water is, and the fact that it uses real essential oils and not any artificial chemicals or perfumes.</li>

            <li>I completely relaxed and was able to do some minor stretching, crack my toes and knuckles and totally fade away.  </li>
            <li>These just might make a new man or woman of you.  </li>
            <li>What really appealed to me was the scent - enough so that it&#x27;s noticeable; not so much that you feel you&#x27;re steeping in a vat-o-perfume.</li>
            <li>and I now realize that the baths help my joints and back a lot more and really relaxes my tight muscles.  </li>

            <li>Sure enough, it helped and I think I recovered a little faster as a result. &#x27;</li>

            <li>: I use a small beach sea sponge and a scrub brush all over when in the warm bath, this helps get rid of loose or dead skin and the combination between freshly scrubbed skin and the warmth of the bath salts feels tingly and soothing.  </li>

            <li> and it was absolutely wonderful.</li>

            <li> Felt great after soaking in it for twenty minutes and for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> The package is very attractive and makes for a perfect gift type item.</li>
            <li> It also makes a beautiful relaxing decoration piece to the apothecary jars surrounding the tub.</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging, and quite a bit of product.</li>

            <li> This is a great foot soak product.</li>
            <li> I tried this version, and it smells great, with a sinus opening and invigorating eucalyptus scent with a touch of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell was great and she had just done a 18 mile run the day before and seemed to think the salts helped.  </li>
            <li> It felt great on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I happy to say, that for (about) the millionth time I am happy that I listened to my wife and accepted this product for  review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a great product -</li>
            <li> To relax at the end of my day I run a very warm bath and add in about a handful of the Muscle Soak Bath Salts</li>
            <li> Epsom salts are wonderful for achy muscles, and this one makes it even better by adding eucalyptus and peppermint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and would make a wonderful gift for an athlete or any hard-working person in your life who might enjoy a muscle soak.</li>
            <li> We deserve to feel the best and be the healthiest we can, and a soak in \\&quot;Muscle Soak\\&quot; is a very special treat in achieving this goal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the combination of mint and eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> We found the San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s bath salts, including these epsom salts lightly scented with eucalyptus and peppermint oils, to be among the best we have used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried combining it with body wash to create a scrub, but it disintegrates too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> A lengthy soak in these wonderful salts lifts the tiredness, relieves the aching, and leaves my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> A nice, pleasant scent that also helps with the relaxation aspect of the salts.</li>
            <li> Excellent bath salts, great smell, very relaxing.</li>

            <li> and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> It also comes nicely packaged in an attractive, sturdy plastic pouch that has an interesting feature: an aroma valve.</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> Will order more soon!</li>
            <li> It was better than drugs!</li>
            <li> But it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I would wear this scent as a perfume, and it would probably be amazing since I do work in a spa.</li>
            <li> The bath smells so nice and will increase your water temperature to stay warm longer-very relaxing.</li>
            <li> reminds me of how much I liked taking baths and of the therapeutic value of just relaxing in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.</li>
            <li> Nice touch!&lt;br</li>
            <li> the San Francisco Salts Muscle Soak bath is a very easy recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then they want some of their own :).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a shower person than a bath person, but the muscle soak bath salts are a nice product for showering as well as for tub baths.</li>
            <li> They dissolves quickly, creates a pleasant scent that&#x27;s noticeable without being overwhelming, and the result is just so nice on sore muscles.</li>
            <li> However, once you add it to a warm bath, the scent is very mild and the peppermint doesn&#x27;t cause any tingling.</li>
            <li> It dissolved nicely and the minty fragrance filled the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Making sure all the kids were in bed, I got in the bath and almost melted with the decadence.</li>
            <li> look forward to the next time I can slip away and indulge in this wonderful treat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure some was lost during transit.</li>
            <li> I love these brands of salt baths.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I was able to save 98% of it</li>
            <li> I definitely am quite impressed with the San Francisco Salt Company version.</li>
            <li> The stickiness of the top of the bag fades over time.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with the product and the price.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> what more can you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of the most relaxing bath salts I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a winning product for bath salt users, as were all bath salt products we have tried from this company.</li>
            <li> It made my soak more luxurious and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak to all the magical benefits that some people are espousing about.</li>
            <li> me, it&#x27;s an incredibly satisfying, armoatherapy, soaking bath experience that leaves me feeling relaxed and at ease with the world.</li>
            <li> They are made of Epsom salts, which is mostly magnesium sulfate.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what it was going to be like, but it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this, and have recommended it to people.&lt;br /&gt;[The</li>
            <li> /&gt;The aroma is not perfumed, but earthy and mellow (eucalyptus and peppermint); not pungent or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> and while I did receive it for reviewing purposes we will be buying more of the Muscle Soak both for ourselves and as gifts for our friends.  </li>
            <li> San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s \\&quot;Muscle Soak\\&quot; is a many wondrous thing.</li>
            <li> a licensed Esthetician, I am very familiar with the benefits of using Epsom Salts for the body.</li>
            <li> A good hot bath with a couple of handfuls of this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not much for baths, but this was just wonderful -</li>
            <li> I would have to say that this product is super excellent for someone who works out, such as myself.</li>
            <li> It has a great (and all natural) scent of mint and eucalyptus - that is both sweet and very smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing to remember back to my childhood when everyone knew the benefits of Epsom salts in a bath to relax, for use to exfoliate your skin and feet and as a good soak to remove toxins and even soak an injured joint or cut to help reduce infection.  </li>
            <li> Dissolves quickly in both cool and warm</li>
            <li> In order to get the full benefit of the epsom salts in the bath, it would take more than the handful suggested in the directions.  </li>
            <li> As for the salt itself, it&#x27;s fine while not being too powdery.</li>
            <li> I let my daughter take two handfuls to mix around in the bath before she got in, and she said everything felt fine.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and was great after a long week of weightlifting.</li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s nothing I love better at the end of the day than taking a long soak with bath salts and a good book.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful with bath salts, because in my experience, many of the products are too strong and your bathroom ends up smelling like vaporub, and it isn&#x27;t the most pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> You put two large handfuls of Muscle Soak Bath Salt into a warm bath and then soak for 20 minutes for a therapy bath.  </li>
            <li> The scents are all amazing, I love how your skin feels during and after the bath, silky soft.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that our water bill is going up because of taking more baths instead of showers but it is well worth the time to relax and enjoy life.&lt;br</li>

            <li> personally am a huge bath taker because I find it relaxing, but for the days that I just don&#x27;t have time I do take showers.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to enjoy a soak yet.</li>
            <li> Now give me a nice glass of Scotch, and I could spend way too much time in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> It works nicely providing a gentle scrub and massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will gently exfoliate your feet, and the scent will fill your shower for that nice aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This will gently exfoliate your feet, and the scent will fill your shower for that nice aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a nice 30 soak you can rinse and get ready for a night in the town or hit the hay.</li>
            <li> The San Francisco Salt Muscle Soak is a fantastic additional to any bath.</li>
            <li> Until the bath salts dissolved, they had a mild exfoliating effect, and the peppermint scent was very pleasant, almost exactly like the smell when you open a tin of Altoids</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like strong scents and this one was just right for me - not too strong yet noticeable.</li>
            <li> They dissolve very easily, and I found the bath very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Francisco Salt Company bath salts are of amazing high quality for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> But every so often, mostly when I just ache all over, I&#x27;ll take a long hot soak because the heat has great thearapeutic benefit to my sore and achy</li>
            <li> In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making my own bath salts for my husband for some time using sea salt and essential oils, and the peppermint and eucalyptus blend has been his favorite for years.</li>
            <li> Slipping into the warm water with the armoas coming off the water is like a spa experience in your own bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I can tell you is that this product is first class in all regards... from the website of the company, to the beautiful packaging to the purity of the product and judicious use of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I used around a quarter cup of salt and the smell was exactly right, strong.</li>
            <li> It has a nice minty smell but that&#x27;s pretty much it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an athlete or just suffer with muscle aches like so many do, you may be interested to learn that magnesium helps to relieve those muscle aches and can be absorbed through your skin.  </li>
            <li> ran a full bath of almost-hot water and added about a cup of the salts.</li>
            <li> I also have their lavender product, and they both are equally good for different frames of mind.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> and I did not want to do anything but get a good night&#x27;s rest, which is something that I lack since starting my business.</li>
            <li> , amp that up with a handful of this Muscle Soak Bath Salts by San Francisco Salt Company and you&#x27;ll be in a place of true bliss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And I&#x27;m excited about using sea salt in the bath because it contains additional minerals which can be absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and food seller.</li>
            <li> So you get a double bonus - a body that feels better and a healthy sleep cycle.  </li>
            <li> but it still quickly dissolves in your tub.  </li>
            <li> , I take a quick shower to remove residual salt from my body.</li>
            <li> and it leaves your skin feeling super</li>
            <li> I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of the product.]</li>
            <li> There is a nice clear plastic window to see the pretty salt crystals.</li>
            <li> One of them is a 10 minute hot bath every night really helps feel and sleep better.</li>
            <li> package for this product is beautiful - nice enough to give as a gift to someone who needs a little pampering.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used different types of Epsom salts over the years, and while they&#x27;ve all worked well for the most part, this kind from San Francisco Bath Salt Company has helped it clear up to the nth degree.</li>
            <li> The salts also worked great on callouses , dead skin, etc, so now my feet are soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy how the scent of these bath salts gives me an added aromatherapy treatment, and it has really helped me with my congestion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the bath salts and they make my skin so soft?  </li>
            <li> Even a short soak at the end of the day can nicely relax you for sleep.</li>
            <li> Magnesium Sulfate can be absorbed into the skin and it is beneficial for you to detoxify your body.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re immediately aware of this awesome yet not overwhelming smell, that for me is intensely relaxing.</li>
            <li> It melted easily into the warm running water, the smell was slightly medicinal, but still pleasing.</li>
            <li> Somehow they get just the right combination of aroma balance.  </li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t like mint taste, I found the bath smelling slightly minty rather pleasant.</li>
            <li> scent in the bag is very strong which I do like, but it can be reminiscent of cough drops for some people because of the eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> I hauled it over to the big claw foot at the very first opportunity and we&#x27;ve been enjoying it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I also use these bath salts mixed in with a little of my body wash to exfoliate my body as needed, I especially love to use this on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also use these bath salts mixed in with a little of my body wash to exfoliate my body as needed, I especially love to use this on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use bath salts frequently for a good, long soak, and my wife does so even more frequently.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy baths, and especially is you enjoy Epsom baths</li>
            <li> I live in a great big Victorian house that, like many in New England, has been divided into a number of smaller apartments.  </li>
            <li> Because the salts are so soluble, it was a very gentle, massaging scrub.</li>
            <li> The smell of eucalyptus and peppermint is amazing, and you can even smell it when the bag is closed.</li>
            <li> and I love them all the same.</li>
            <li> First, the packaging.</li>
            <li> I was sent a review copy of this muscle soak salt by the San Francisco Salt Company, and will definitely buy more when I&#x27;m finished with this bag.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to trying their other products soon, and buying more of this!</li>
            <li> salt dissolved instantly in hot water.</li>
            <li> The samples worked their magic on us and we plan to use them in the future as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first photo shows salt in my hand, you can see the size and texture of the salt grains.</li>
            <li> I also found that if I have a migraine a hot soak help as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (as opposed to a hot bath without salts).</li>
            <li> first sensation comes when you grab the bag of salts and get a whiff of the eucalyptis and peppermint oil that escapes through the \\&quot;Aroma Valve.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You know exactly what you will be using on your body.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Like many of those apartments, mine didn&#x27;t come with a bathtub, only a shower.  </li>
            <li> I put a cup of Muscle Soak Salts in a hot tub and soaked for twenty minutes or so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The salts dissolve easily in hot water</li>
            <li> At first I was going to decline the opportunity to review these salt baths, but I mentioned them to my wife and she wanted to give them a try.</li>
            <li> I bought these salts due to all the amazing reviews I read.</li>
            <li> is pure Magnesium Sulfate (Epsom Salt) that quickly dissolves in warm or hot water and helps to relax stiff and sore muscles and relive your aches and pains.  </li>
            <li> I had to wait several weeks to have a free evening, but it was worth the anticipation and waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The magnesium found in it is absorbed through the skin, benefiting us by fighting osteoporosis and high blood pressure.  </li>
            <li> I have to be honest and say that after three times of having used them, I don&#x27;t really feel any of the &amp;#34;extraordinary&amp;#34; sensations that other people wrote about.</li>
            <li> long, steamy hot shower before going to bed is one of those little luxuries that I love, and the bath salts added a nice touch to the enjoyment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I squeeze the package ever so slightly, there is a nice whiff of peppermint aroma.</li>
            <li> After a bath we found that our skin was super soft...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in reading about the benefits of using sea salt or essential oil in your bath, do a quick internet search for \\&quot;Mark&#x27;s Daily Apple\\&quot; and \\&quot;how to take a better bath\\&quot; for links to some scientific studies that show the benefits of bathing with this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The instructions say to use two large handfuls in a bath.</li>
            <li> Either way, certain to not disappoint.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t really feel like it does much to sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I love making bath salts and have a wide range of aromas on hand to play with.</li>
            <li> I alternate between these and enjoy both.  </li>
            <li> I can tell you about this product, as it&#x27;s something you really need to try for yourself.</li>
            <li> Get a small bag first just to sample it, but if you&#x27;re happy, go ahead and order a big one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using that much.</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus and peppermint scent is clearly noticeable, and I could even distinctly smell each.</li>
            <li> I take a bath every night, and the smell of the eucalyptus and mint combo is really relaxing.</li>
            <li> smell is absolutely divine, but these bath salts come with a bonus.  </li>
            <li> really can</li>
            <li> This product is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m now healed, I do feel much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t use these within a few weeks, get a clamp of some kind to hold it shut.</li>
            <li> In the future, I will buy my epsom salt in bulk and add my own organic essential oil.</li>
            <li> Only giving two stars because the scent isn&#x27;t any stronger or better than the old standby salts.  </li>
            <li> The oils are a nice balance of eucalyptus and menthol or a wintergreen type smell, with a heavy emphasis on peppermint.</li>
            <li> My trips to the tub are far and few between, maybe 3 or 4 a year in a good year.</li>
            <li> Made with all natural ingredients and scented with eucalyptus and peppermint essential oils, these bath salts are fine grained and dissolve readily in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that - the Muscle Soak bath actually does everything that it claims and more it provides a super relaxing bath</li>
            <li> The fragrances are nice and not overwhelming and besides the therapeutic value that you are getting with the salt bath</li>
            <li> package is absolutely gorgeous - the blue is very similar to Tiffany blue.</li>
            <li> WOW, it really works!</li>
            <li> and she is lucky enough to have a huge old claw foot, big enough and deep enough to drown in, so every now and again when I really want a good soak I zip around to visit and spend some time in her tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have made a quick video of four different salts that I had the privilege to review for the San Francisco Salt company</li>
            <li> have made a quick video of four different salts that I had the privilege to review for the San Francisco Salt company</li>
            <li> It really is very well dosed to give just the right scent for deep relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> more than a plain old soak in hot water would have.</li>
            <li> I add in a little more of the Muscle</li>
            <li> After a long day at work there is nothing I love more than taking a relaxing hot bath, and I always love to add a little something extra to my water, and lately it&#x27;s been the San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s Muscle Soak Bath Salts.</li>
            <li> The salts made the water soft and silky, and the mint and eucalyptus in the steam gently opened my sinuses and lungs.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I had a great night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> love how easily this dissolves, how smooth and highly fragranced the water is, and the fact that it uses real essential oils and not any artificial chemicals or perfumes.</li>

            <li> Just the right amount of essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I completely relaxed and was able to do some minor stretching, crack my toes and knuckles and totally fade away.  </li>
            <li> These just might make a new man or woman of you.  </li>
            <li> What really appealed to me was the scent - enough so that it&#x27;s noticeable; not so much that you feel you&#x27;re steeping in a vat-o-perfume.</li>
            <li> and I now realize that the baths help my joints and back a lot more and really relaxes my tight muscles.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I didnt loose any product in delivery.</li>
            <li> find that the hot soak reduces pain and relieve muscle cramps in my back.</li>
            <li> It is also great for soaking your tired feet after a long day of standing or walking a lot.  </li>
            <li> The plastic fold-over bag doesn&#x27;t mind being in a wet bathroom environment, and is easy to open and close.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, it helped and I think I recovered a little faster as a result. &#x27;</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s only so much</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s packaged in such a way that it looks like a real luxury product, and it has a square base so it fits perfectly inside our medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> : I use a small beach sea sponge and a scrub brush all over when in the warm bath, this helps get rid of loose or dead skin and the combination between freshly scrubbed skin and the warmth of the bath salts feels tingly and soothing.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1H8ED8CJX054J]]I have gotten out of the habit of taking a long hot soaking bath to relax my muscles and back in favor of the faster shower.  </li>
            <li> I used the amount that was recommended and next time I will use more, because the product is so subtle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m more of a shower person, mainly because our bathtub is so small, but I even tried this stuff out for myself a few days ago to see how it felt.</li>
            <li> They will draw out the toxins and the aromatic combination of eucalyptus and peppermint essential oils will clear the air and</li>
            <li> They used a one way valve technology similar to soft sided coffee packages.</li>

            <li> I was supplied with a 2 pound bag, which is easy to store and has a little bread tie-esque closure to help keep it closed when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, there will be some fall out due to delivery.</li>
            <li> have a total of 7 different bags so far</li>
            <li> This makes the concentration of Epsom Salts higher, and thus works a little faster.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really helps blood flow, as odd as that sounds.</li>
            <li> Epsom salts act as a topical anti-inflammatory and the faint scent is very clean and relaxing.</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;ll be taking a few more  baths and a few less showers as a result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a bad back and after a couple of back surgeries I learned a number strategies that help my back feel better.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll definitely be using this regularly instead of other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like when you buy cookies in a tray with the bag closed you fold the white clips over the end to clamp shut.  </li>
            <li> UPDATE: A minor note.</li>
            <li> bath salts package suggested several ways to use the salts, and one of them was to sprinkle the salts over wet feet and rub the feet together for a massage and foot refresher.</li>
            <li> In fact since then she has used them in a bath after every long run.  </li>
            <li> The essential thing about this package, unless the package is squeezed, there is absolutely no aroma.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not long ago the San Francisco Salt Company sent me a bag of their [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> long hours or heavy physical activities can cause muscle strain and overall fatigue.  </li>
            <li> The bags are not sealed closed, they only thing holding them closed on the ends are those fold over like bread ties or clamps.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that my three-year old daughter wanted to DRINK her bath water.</li>
            <li> I have a bad back and have issues with muscle spasms, so my first try with this was after a busy day when my back was problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, I will admit that I was very skeptical about the San Francisco Salts Epson Soak baths.</li>
            <li> The twist tie was not on correctly and the seal was loose.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to purchase this item as well as other products from San Francisco Bath Salt Company!</li>
            <li> This arrived at a fortuitous time since I was sore from not only the usual spots (back) but also had a muscle pull in my arm.</li>
            <li> My back felt tight after twenty minutes of stretching and still had some aches and pains</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure if this was due to improper handling or just a bad design flaw with the packaging.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really bad eczema, ranging from mild red bumps on her skin to looking like she had a run-in with poison oak at times.</li>
            <li> , I just turned the small box to the corner and pored back into bag.  </li>

            <li> It does not smell, or feel fake or over processed like some other salts I have used, and the price is very competitive.</li>
            <li> usually use one or two hand fulls of salt per bath, so one 2 pound bag lasts quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received a sample of Muscle Soak Bath Salt in exchange for writing a review of the product. We have four kids and live on a farm, so most days I go to bed exhausted and sore. But there&#x27;s nothing I love better at the end of the day than taking a long soak with bath salts and a good book. I had to wait several weeks to have a free evening, but it was worth the anticipation and waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsom salts have been used for hundreds of years as an aid to muscle aches, sprains, and to draw the toxinsfrom our bodies. The magnesium found in it is absorbed through the skin, benefiting us by fighting osteoporosis and high blood pressure.  I&#x27;ve used plain epsom salts for decades, although usually just the plain, unfragranced ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package for this product is beautiful - nice enough to give as a gift to someone who needs a little pampering. I sniffed the mint and eucalyptus scent through the little valve on the package and decided that I couldn&#x27;t put it off another night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran a full bath of almost-hot water and added about a cup of the salts. It dissolved nicely and the minty fragrance filled the bathroom. Making sure all the kids were in bed, I got in the bath and almost melted with the decadence. The salts made the water soft and silky, and the mint and eucalyptus in the steam gently opened my sinuses and lungs. I soaked until the water got cold, and felt so relaxed. All the aches and pains of the day were gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to the next time I can slip away and indulge in this wonderful treat!</li>
            <li> This is a gift, so I can&#x27;t testify to its use. It smells delightful - nice peppermint scent. When it arrived, though, the bag was opened and salt was spilt throughout the box. I&#x27;m sure some was lost during transit. I can&#x27;t be sure if this was due to improper handling or just a bad design flaw with the packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought these salts due to all the amazing reviews I read. I have to be honest and say that after three times of having used them, I don&#x27;t really feel any of the &amp;#34;extraordinary&amp;#34; sensations that other people wrote about. It has a nice minty smell but that&#x27;s pretty much it, I don&#x27;t really feel like it does much to sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making my own bath salts for my husband for some time using sea salt and essential oils, and the peppermint and eucalyptus blend has been his favorite for years. What I found interesting about this product is that it&#x27;s not actually that much more expensive than making your own, and the added vitamin E and aloe vera definitely gave him slightly softer skin then just plain sea salt and essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how easily this dissolves, how smooth and highly fragranced the water is, and the fact that it uses real essential oils and not any artificial chemicals or perfumes. It&#x27;s packaged in such a way that it looks like a real luxury product, and it has a square base so it fits perfectly inside our medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m excited about using sea salt in the bath because it contains additional minerals which can be absorbed through the skin. If you&#x27;re interested in reading about the benefits of using sea salt or essential oil in your bath, do a quick internet search for \\&quot;Mark&#x27;s Daily Apple\\&quot; and \\&quot;how to take a better bath\\&quot; for links to some scientific studies that show the benefits of bathing with this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and would make a wonderful gift for an athlete or any hard-working person in your life who might enjoy a muscle soak.</li>
            <li> Love the bath salts and they make my skin so soft?  Quick delivery and food seller.</li>
            <li> I love these brands of salt baths.&lt;br /&gt;I have a total of 7 different bags so far and I love them all the same. Fast shipping, there will be some fall out due to delivery. The bags are not sealed closed, they only thing holding them closed on the ends are those fold over like bread ties or clamps. Like when you buy cookies in a tray with the bag closed you fold the white clips over the end to clamp shut.  One bag was almost all spilt out but I was able to save 98% of it, I just turned the small box to the corner and pored back into bag.  The scents are all amazing, I love how your skin feels during and after the bath, silky soft. Tip: I use a small beach sea sponge and a scrub brush all over when in the warm bath, this helps get rid of loose or dead skin and the combination between freshly scrubbed skin and the warmth of the bath salts feels tingly and soothing.  I take bath often, ever since I made my hubby a bath he ALWAYS joins my bath now.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love making bath salts and have a wide range of aromas on hand to play with. I&#x27;ve always loved the combination of mint and eucalyptus. My boyfriend adores it as well, which of course is an added bonus. I definitely am quite impressed with the San Francisco Salt Company version. Somehow they get just the right combination of aroma balance.  First, the packaging. They did a great job there. The plastic fold-over bag doesn&#x27;t mind being in a wet bathroom environment, and is easy to open and close. The aroma valve lets you test out the scent before opening it, and encourages house visitors to give it a sniff. Then they want some of their own :).  The bath salts work just the way they should. They dissolves quickly, creates a pleasant scent that&#x27;s noticeable without being overwhelming, and the result is just so nice on sore muscles. You don&#x27;t have to dedicate two hours to the process, either (although you can if you want!). Even a short soak at the end of the day can nicely relax you for sleep. So you get a double bonus - a body that feels better and a healthy sleep cycle.  I also have their lavender product, and they both are equally good for different frames of mind. It all depends on what fragrances you&#x27;re personally drawn to and what mood you want to be in when you&#x27;re done. I alternate between these and enjoy both.  Well recommended.  I was sent a review copy of this muscle soak salt by the San Francisco Salt Company, and will definitely buy more when I&#x27;m finished with this bag.  UPDATE: A minor note. The stickiness of the top of the bag fades over time. So if you don&#x27;t use these within a few weeks, get a clamp of some kind to hold it shut.</li>
            <li> Great bath salts. Just the right amount of essential oil.  This product would have received 5 stars except for pricing. In order to get the full benefit of the epsom salts in the bath, it would take more than the handful suggested in the directions.  In the future, I will buy my epsom salt in bulk and add my own organic essential oil.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful with bath salts, because in my experience, many of the products are too strong and your bathroom ends up smelling like vaporub, and it isn&#x27;t the most pleasant experience. I found this salt to be subtle in its smell and texture. It melted easily into the warm running water, the smell was slightly medicinal, but still pleasing. I used the amount that was recommended and next time I will use more, because the product is so subtle. That is not a knock on the product, it is a compliment. It does not smell, or feel fake or over processed like some other salts I have used, and the price is very competitive. I will order again, as I felt it helped my muscles more than a plain old soak in hot water would have. Overall, very happy with the product and the price.&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though it was in a bag it arrived well protected and well packaged, with no tearing of the bad anywhere. Sometimes this can be a dodgy prospect with Amazon, but this product was shipped well.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really bad eczema, ranging from mild red bumps on her skin to looking like she had a run-in with poison oak at times. We&#x27;ve used different types of Epsom salts over the years, and while they&#x27;ve all worked well for the most part, this kind from San Francisco Bath Salt Company has helped it clear up to the nth degree. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made after just two baths using two small handfuls of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s only so much I can tell you about this product, as it&#x27;s something you really need to try for yourself. I was supplied with a 2 pound bag, which is easy to store and has a little bread tie-esque closure to help keep it closed when you&#x27;re done. The smell of eucalyptus and peppermint is amazing, and you can even smell it when the bag is closed. As for the salt itself, it&#x27;s fine while not being too powdery. I let my daughter take two handfuls to mix around in the bath before she got in, and she said everything felt fine. That night, she had a fairly big red patch on her arm (eczema), and the next day is had cleared up almost entirely. After the next bath, it was gone. We&#x27;ll definitely be using this regularly instead of other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more of a shower person, mainly because our bathtub is so small, but I even tried this stuff out for myself a few days ago to see how it felt. My shoulders and triceps had been a little sore from kettlebell routines, and I always hear people talking about using Epsom salt baths to help with sore muscles. Sure enough, it helped and I think I recovered a little faster as a result. &#x27;could just be in my head though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m grateful that San Francisco Bath Salt Company contacted me and let me try this out. I look forward to trying their other products soon, and buying more of this! Get a small bag first just to sample it, but if you&#x27;re happy, go ahead and order a big one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I saw this at my massage envy.  It smelled great.  Since it&#x27;s pricey, I mix with regular Epsom salts.  Again, it has a great smell.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product and it exceeded my expectations. I will definitely continue to purchase this item as well as other products from San Francisco Bath Salt Company!</li>
            <li> Just received the salts this past week so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to enjoy a soak yet. But it smells amazing. It also makes a beautiful relaxing decoration piece to the apothecary jars surrounding the tub.</li>
            <li> Great product. The bath smells so nice and will increase your water temperature to stay warm longer-very relaxing. Delivery packaging could improve. The twist tie was not on correctly and the seal was loose. Luckily I didnt loose any product in delivery.</li>
            <li> Not exactly sure why this is so pricey.</li>
            <li> Only giving two stars because the scent isn&#x27;t any stronger or better than the old standby salts.  I will stick with the store brands.  No different.</li>
            <li> treat yourself to these bath salts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a shower person than a bath person, but the muscle soak bath salts are a nice product for showering as well as for tub baths. For my nighttime shower, I use a body wash that has about the consistency of shaving cream. To a handful of the body wash, I added about a teaspoon of the muscle soak bath salts and worked them together for a few seconds, then scrubbed up. Until the bath salts dissolved, they had a mild exfoliating effect, and the peppermint scent was very pleasant, almost exactly like the smell when you open a tin of Altoids mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bath salts package suggested several ways to use the salts, and one of them was to sprinkle the salts over wet feet and rub the feet together for a massage and foot refresher. I tried this, and it felt great, plus the effects of the peppermint aroma wafting up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long, steamy hot shower before going to bed is one of those little luxuries that I love, and the bath salts added a nice touch to the enjoyment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> This is a great foot soak product. I tried this version, and it smells great, with a sinus opening and invigorating eucalyptus scent with a touch of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet are all now relaxed and tingly, which may  be a contradiction but it&#x27;s true.  The salts also worked great on callouses , dead skin, etc, so now my feet are soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent and it works, what more can you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample for review.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1H8ED8CJX054J]]I have gotten out of the habit of taking a long hot soaking bath to relax my muscles and back in favor of the faster shower.  I started using these bath salts and I now realize that the baths help my joints and back a lot more and really relaxes my tight muscles.  This Muscle Soak Bath Salt from the San Francisco Bath Salt Company reminds me of how much I liked taking baths and of the therapeutic value of just relaxing in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Muscle Soak Bath Salt is pure Magnesium Sulfate (Epsom Salt) that quickly dissolves in warm or hot water and helps to relax stiff and sore muscles and relive your aches and pains.  It also includes the addition of Eucalyptus essential Oil and Peppermint Essential Oil. You put two large handfuls of Muscle Soak Bath Salt into a warm bath and then soak for 20 minutes for a therapy bath.  It is also great for soaking your tired feet after a long day of standing or walking a lot.  The fragrances are nice and not overwhelming and besides the therapeutic value that you are getting with the salt bath you are also getting an aroma therapy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a medium grind of salt but it still quickly dissolves in your tub.  It is amazing to remember back to my childhood when everyone knew the benefits of Epsom salts in a bath to relax, for use to exfoliate your skin and feet and as a good soak to remove toxins and even soak an injured joint or cut to help reduce infection.  In today&#x27;s world we don&#x27;t take the time to relax and unwind. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you work on a construction site or just carrying around your children all day.  We all get sore and tired and this product can help your aching back to feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaking in a tub with Muscle Soak Bath Salt can relieve arthritis, muscle and nerve pain.  Magnesium Sulfate can be absorbed into the skin and it is beneficial for you to detoxify your body.  It is time to revitalize and pamper yourself with a nice relaxing and therapeutic salt bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have made a quick video of four different salts that I had the privilege to review for the San Francisco Salt company and I hope you take the time to watch it.  I have listed the links to the other three products in the video for your information.  My wife and I liked them all and I can tell you that our water bill is going up because of taking more baths instead of showers but it is well worth the time to relax and enjoy life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the links to the products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsoak Epsom Salt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salt 2 Lbs]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minera Dead Sea Salt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AMO22SM Minera Dead Sea Salt Bulk 10 Lb Bag Fine Grain, 100% Certified Pure Mineral Bath Salt]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleep lavender Bath Salts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AYNNX34 Sleep Lavender Bath Salts 2 Lbs]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like you to know that I was supplied samples of these products and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have made a quick video of four different salts that I had the privilege to review for the San Francisco Salt company and I hope you take the time to watch it.

            <li> I got this for my girlfriend for Valentines day. We rented a hotel room with a two person jacuzzi and used this and it was absolutely wonderful. The smell was great and she had just done a 18 mile run the day before and seemed to think the salts helped.  In fact since then she has used them in a bath after every long run.  No complaints, would purchase again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> San Francisco Salt Company muscle soak is like laying down in peppermint, eucalyptus, and wintergreen heaven. This is one of the most relaxing bath salts I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is absolutely gorgeous - the blue is very similar to Tiffany blue. There is a nice clear plastic window to see the pretty salt crystals. They used a one way valve technology similar to soft sided coffee packages. If I squeeze the package ever so slightly, there is a nice whiff of peppermint aroma. The essential thing about this package, unless the package is squeezed, there is absolutely no aroma. That means San Francisco Salt Company has chosen a nearly perfect plastic package that keeps all the oils in with the salts until it is time to use them. If I can smell peppermint from the package, the oils are evaporating and won&#x27;t keep well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use two large handfuls in a bath. I can&#x27;t imagine using that much. I used around a quarter cup of salt and the smell was exactly right, strong. The oils are a nice balance of eucalyptus and menthol or a wintergreen type smell, with a heavy emphasis on peppermint. This blend takes the salts from being in a Christmas candy cane to something spa-like and ultra-relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salt dissolved instantly in hot water. It leaves no residue. There are no surfactants or soapy products in this, so the bath doesn&#x27;t bubble. Being salts and oils means the bath water doesn&#x27;t get slimy (a lot of bath salts do this), or leave a residue on my skin. The bath was tingly. It felt great on my skin. I got way too relaxed in this bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bag of relaxation. Now give me a nice glass of Scotch, and I could spend way too much time in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> I use bath salts frequently for a good, long soak, and my wife does so even more frequently. We found the San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s bath salts, including these epsom salts lightly scented with eucalyptus and peppermint oils, to be among the best we have used. We got them in a sampler box provided by the company for review purposes. The samples worked their magic on us and we plan to use them in the future as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These epsom salts appear to be nearly identical to the company&#x27;s unscented version, [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak]]. They dissolve very easily, and I found the bath very relaxing. The eucalyptus and peppermint scent is clearly noticeable, and I could even distinctly smell each. But the scent is not overpowering. It really is very well dosed to give just the right scent for deep relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife reports that her headaches went away after bathing with these epsom salts -- including with the unscented version. She also reports neck stiffness and pain reduced, and softer skin. I think even I have to admit that the thick calluses on my feet seemed to soften a bit for a few days after bathing with these salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a winning product for bath salt users, as were all bath salt products we have tried from this company.</li>
            <li> I would have to say that this product is super excellent for someone who works out, such as myself. It had been a long while since I worked out and getting back into it was somewhat difficult. However, using this product not only helped me to soak my muscles, but I felt completely relaxed and I did not want to do anything but get a good night&#x27;s rest, which is something that I lack since starting my business. San Francisco Salt Company, you guys rock!</li>
            <li> I have a bad back and after a couple of back surgeries I learned a number strategies that help my back feel better. One of them is a 10 minute hot bath every night really helps feel and sleep better. Recently I included Muscle Soak Bath Salts from San Francisco Bath Salt Company into my routine. The salts make the bath smell minty. Even though I don&#x27;t like mint taste, I found the bath smelling slightly minty rather pleasant. I don&#x27;t like strong scents and this one was just right for me - not too strong yet noticeable. It made my soak more luxurious and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer Lavender scent to Mint scent San Francisco Bath Salt Company sells salts with different scents, for example Lavender Bath Salts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a collage of two photos (you can locate it by following &#x27;customer photos&#x27; link under the main photo). The first photo shows salt in my hand, you can see the size and texture of the salt grains. The second photo shows the bag the salts came in, the salt has a white color. It comes in a resealable plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the hot soak reduces pain and relieve muscle cramps in my back. I also found that if I have a migraine a hot soak help as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use one or two hand fulls of salt per bath, so one 2 pound bag lasts quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received an evaluation bag of Muscle Soak Bath Salts for evaluation and an honest review. I have been using salt soaks for a couple of weeks now. In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit. I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (as opposed to a hot bath without salts). It takes fewer strokes with a pumice sponge to get my feet totally smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the use in the tub, I also tried using a bit of salt as skin exfoliator. It works nicely providing a gentle scrub and massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the effects of adding salts to my bath and will continue to use them, but I personally prefer the Lavender scented salt to the Mint scented one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewl continue to use them, but I personally prefer the Lavender scented salt to the Mint scented one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moV80SLZEK55NG]]Taking the time for a long soaking bath is something I don&#x27;t indulge in very often. I&#x27;m a shower kind of guy. My trips to the tub are far and few between, maybe 3 or 4 a year in a good year. But every so often, mostly when I just ache all over, I&#x27;ll take a long hot soak because the heat has great thearapeutic benefit to my sore and achy muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, amp that up with a handful of this Muscle Soak Bath Salts by San Francisco Salt Company and you&#x27;ll be in a place of true bliss. You&#x27;ll experience, as I did, a multi-sensory bath experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first sensation comes when you grab the bag of salts and get a whiff of the eucalyptis and peppermint oil that escapes through the \\&quot;Aroma Valve.\\&quot; That armoa becomes stronger once the bag opens and you scoop a handful of the salts and mix them into the bath water. You&#x27;re immediately aware of this awesome yet not overwhelming smell, that for me is intensely relaxing. Slipping into the warm water with the armoas coming off the water is like a spa experience in your own bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the bath, I take a quick shower to remove residual salt from my body. A very subtle armoa from the esssential oils lingers and just extends the calming feeling from the bath. It&#x27;s a great experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to all the magical benefits that some people are espousing about. All I can tell you is that this product is first class in all regards... from the website of the company, to the beautiful packaging to the purity of the product and judicious use of essential oils.  Even the narrative on the packaging is enticing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s an incredibly satisfying, armoatherapy, soaking bath experience that leaves me feeling relaxed and at ease with the world. It&#x27;s my little escape and I think I&#x27;ll be taking a few more  baths and a few less showers as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review.</li>
            <li> I run a lot, and my muscles are joints are always sore. I take a bath every night, and the smell of the eucalyptus and mint combo is really relaxing. I feel like it really helps blood flow, as odd as that sounds. I didn&#x27;t want something that smelled like a packet of tea - there&#x27;s a floral scent even though it&#x27;s mint and eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> After a long day at work there is nothing I love more than taking a relaxing hot bath, and I always love to add a little something extra to my water, and lately it&#x27;s been the San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s Muscle Soak Bath Salts. This product has been working wonders on soothing my aching muscles at the end of my day.&lt;br /&gt;What are the features?&lt;br /&gt;Epsom Salt infused with Peppermint and Eucalyptus Oils&lt;br /&gt;Great for soothing tired aching muscles&lt;br /&gt;Bonus aromatherapy treatment&lt;br /&gt;Feels like you&#x27;re in the spa&lt;br /&gt;Made only of natural ingredients- Epsom Salt, Eucalyptus Essential Oil, and Peppermint Essential Oil. You know exactly what you will be using on your body.&lt;br /&gt;As a licensed Esthetician, I am very familiar with the benefits of using Epsom Salts for the body. Some of the benefits include:&lt;br /&gt; Soothing tired or strained muscles&lt;br /&gt;Treating cold or congestion by opening up your nasal passageways&lt;br /&gt;Relaxing your nervous system and helping you de-stress&lt;br /&gt;Healing skin issues such as Eczema and Psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;Healing open wounds&lt;br /&gt;Pulling excess toxins from your body&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliating your skin&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me say that I am absolutely in love with the scent of the Muscle Soak Bath Salts, they smell of Peppermint and Eucalyptus in the most perfect way, which makes me feel like I&#x27;m giving myself a luxurious spa treatment from the comfort of my own home. I would wear this scent as a perfume, and it would probably be amazing since I do work in a spa. To relax at the end of my day I run a very warm bath and add in about a handful of the Muscle Soak Bath Salts and they dissolve immediately. I enjoy how the scent of these bath salts gives me an added aromatherapy treatment, and it has really helped me with my congestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have some sort of ailment, such as an achy back I add in a little more of the Muscle Soak Bath Salts, I add in about 2 cups or so. This makes the concentration of Epsom Salts higher, and thus works a little faster. I also use these bath salts mixed in with a little of my body wash to exfoliate my body as needed, I especially love to use this on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally am a huge bath taker because I find it relaxing, but for the days that I just don&#x27;t have time I do take showers. The Muscle Soak Bath Salts can be used in the shower as well, simply sprinkle some of the Muscle Soak on your feet and rub them together. This will gently exfoliate your feet, and the scent will fill your shower for that nice aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely hooked on the San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s Muscle Soak Bath Salts. I&#x27;m going to need to buy the 20lb bag as soon as my current bag runs out! I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.r.

            <li> I live in a great big Victorian house that, like many in New England, has been divided into a number of smaller apartments.  Like many of those apartments, mine didn&#x27;t come with a bathtub, only a shower.  My youngest daughter, however, lives just around the corner and she is lucky enough to have a huge old claw foot, big enough and deep enough to drown in, so every now and again when I really want a good soak I zip around to visit and spend some time in her tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not long ago the San Francisco Salt Company sent me a bag of their [[ASIN:B004MBJKRC Muscle Soak Bath Salts]].  I hauled it over to the big claw foot at the very first opportunity and we&#x27;ve been enjoying it ever since.  (Of course I shared!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is absolutely divine, but these bath salts come with a bonus.  They are made of Epsom salts, which is mostly magnesium sulfate.  If you&#x27;re an athlete or just suffer with muscle aches like so many do, you may be interested to learn that magnesium helps to relieve those muscle aches and can be absorbed through your skin.  A good hot bath with a couple of handfuls of this really can help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B004MBJKRC Muscle Soak Bath Salts]] come in a very attractive, resealable package.  Made with all natural ingredients and scented with eucalyptus and peppermint essential oils, these bath salts are fine grained and dissolve readily in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - These just might make a new man or woman of you.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I am at the spa, even in my small bath tub! (I paired it with California Breeze, which was perfect!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest concern was the scent. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what it was going to be like, but it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to describe the smell, I would say it reminds me of peppermint, subtle. I think it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried combining it with body wash to create a scrub, but it disintegrates too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong. Beautiful packaging, and quite a bit of product.</li>
            <li> Epsom salts are wonderful for achy muscles, and this one makes it even better by adding eucalyptus and peppermint. I have a bad back and have issues with muscle spasms, so my first try with this was after a busy day when my back was problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent in the bag is very strong which I do like, but it can be reminiscent of cough drops for some people because of the eucalyptus. However, once you add it to a warm bath, the scent is very mild and the peppermint doesn&#x27;t cause any tingling. Epsom salts act as a topical anti-inflammatory and the faint scent is very clean and relaxing. I didn&#x27;t want to get out of the bath at all. It was just marvelous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also mixed it with liquid soap and used it as a scrub. Because the salts are so soluble, it was a very gentle, massaging scrub. It didn&#x27;t feel at all like washing with a sandpaper washcloth the way some scrubs can. The eucalyptus/peppermint scent is a lot stronger this way. Mixing it with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap made for a very invigorating scrub that wasn&#x27;t harsh at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this, and have recommended it to people.&lt;br /&gt;[The product reviewed was provided to me at no cost for the purposes of review. I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of the product.]</li>
            <li> My back felt tight after twenty minutes of stretching and still had some aches and pains so I decided to use my muscle soak. WOW, it really works! Felt great after soaking in it for twenty minutes and for the rest of the day! Would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Step in into this salt soak after any day with tension and find the soothing relaxation you desire...long hours or heavy physical activities can cause muscle strain and overall fatigue.  After a nice 30 soak you can rinse and get ready for a night in the town or hit the hay. Either way, certain to not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Love these! Will order more soon!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and was great after a long week of weightlifting. I didn&#x27;t expect the bag to be so small, but then again, I might not have read the description properly.</li>
            <li> The other night after a very tough week and a working Saturday, I couldn&#x27;t sleep and I was sore all over.  I put a cup of Muscle Soak Salts in a hot tub and soaked for twenty minutes or so. The salts completely dissolved. It was better than drugs! I completely relaxed and was able to do some minor stretching, crack my toes and knuckles and totally fade away.  I also massaged my feet and a few achy muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is not perfumed, but earthy and mellow (eucalyptus and peppermint); not pungent or overwhelming. After the bath, I just lay on my bed and felt my skin and muscles actually pulsate. Needless to say, I had a great night&#x27;s sleep. I think this is going to be a regular ritual. There is also an aroma plug on the back so you can test the smell before using. I plan on using this on the evenings after I work out.  The package is very attractive and makes for a perfect gift type item. Product generously supplied by San Francisco Bath Salt Company.</li>
            <li> This arrived at a fortuitous time since I was sore from not only the usual spots (back) but also had a muscle pull in my arm. Why I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m now healed, I do feel much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salts dissolve easily in hot water so you don&#x27;t get that gritty feel that can occur when using bath salts. What really appealed to me was the scent - enough so that it&#x27;s noticeable; not so much that you feel you&#x27;re steeping in a vat-o-perfume. A nice, pleasant scent that also helps with the relaxation aspect of the salts. I&#x27;m usually not much for baths, but this was just wonderful - I didn&#x27;t want to get out of the tub!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also something that I&#x27;ll keep in mind as a gift - who doesn&#x27;t need a relaxation soak? It also comes nicely packaged in an attractive, sturdy plastic pouch that has an interesting feature: an aroma valve. It&#x27;s similar to the \\&quot;buttons\\&quot; that you see on coffee pouches, but this allows you to sniff the scent before opening the bag. Nice touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;[Manufacturer provided sample for review]</li>
            <li> Ok, I will admit that I was very skeptical about the San Francisco Salts Epson Soak baths. At first I was going to decline the opportunity to review these salt baths, but I mentioned them to my wife and she wanted to give them a try. I happy to say, that for (about) the millionth time I am happy that I listened to my wife and accepted this product for  review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The San Francisco Salt Muscle Soak is a fantastic additional to any bath. It has a great (and all natural) scent of mint and eucalyptus - that is both sweet and very smooth.  The only negative is that my three-year old daughter wanted to DRINK her bath water. Other than that - the Muscle Soak bath actually does everything that it claims and more it provides a super relaxing bath and it leaves your skin feeling super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- After a bath we found that our skin was super soft... in fact it was softer than using the Muscle Soak baths than after using a moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Dissolves quickly in both cool and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does not leave any residue in the tub&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does help relax your muscles while in the bath tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Helps to soften any callouses that you may have on the bottoms of your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The mint fragrance fills the entire room and lingers for about an hour after pulling the plug on your bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict - What a great product - and while I did receive it for reviewing purposes we will be buying more of the Muscle Soak both for ourselves and as gifts for our friends.  If you enjoy baths, and especially is you enjoy Epsom baths the San Francisco Salts Muscle Soak bath is a very easy recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note - I received this product for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s \\&quot;Muscle Soak\\&quot; is a many wondrous thing. These old bones of mine get weary sometimes, and I often over-do the exercise. A lengthy soak in these wonderful salts lifts the tiredness, relieves the aching, and leaves my skin silky smooth (you can also mix a small amount into you shower gel, or sprinkle a little on a soapy wash cloth if you just want the exfoliating benefits of these salts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you should have a cold or flu, these salts are extremely beneficial. They will draw out the toxins and the aromatic combination of eucalyptus and peppermint essential oils will clear the air and your clogged up head...you find yourself breathing again! It&#x27;s a simply delicious, fresh aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;San Francisco Salt Company bath salts are of amazing high quality for an affordable price.
