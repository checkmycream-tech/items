            <li>I find it to be okay.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this line of hair product, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>Most of them focus on the shampooing and not on the conditioning, which leaves my hair frizzy and unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair felt more fuller and voluminous.  </li>
            <li>and this conditioner gave me a fullness and healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I love the lemon peel zest</li>
            <li>What I love about [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than the coconut oil.</li>
            <li>But with this I notice my hair does not get quite as oily which makes me feel better.</li>
            <li>I just love how shiny this makes my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with everything lemon that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, my hair still smelled fresh and clean though not fragranced, and had an attractive shine even though I&#x27;d slept on</li>
            <li>I also have oily hair (shows after just one day), so i have to wash it every day; using this Beautiful Nutrition conditioner, I find my hair is left soft and clean, just perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and with that comes difficulty with most hair products.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m using with Beautiful Nutrition&#x27;s Citrus Pectin Healthy Hair Diet shampoo, Grapefruit Detox shine repair serum and Infrizzable hair cuticle corrector sealing serum finishing products - whichever is needed, not both at the same time).</li>
            <li>I recently had surgery and had to find a product that would keep my hair looking good in between shampoos and this was it!</li>
            <li>My daughter has hair that turns frizzy easily and this conditioner worked wonders.  </li>
            <li>even my kids&#x27;  hair looks great when they wash themselves and barely brush.</li>
            <li>This Paraben Free and DEA Free hair product is cruelty Free, not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received Free, one bottle of Cleaner</li>
            <li>I received Free, one bottle of Cleaner</li>
            <li>I thought this sounded fun, because sometimes if you are at a gym or a hotel and don&#x27;t want to bring the whole array of products, it seems nice to just be able to use this.</li>
            <li>received one free bottle for review purposes.</li>
            <li>The other dual acting products never seem to condition, Beautiful Nutrition Cleaner Longer Rinse Out conditions beautifully.  </li>
            <li>It had been getting wiry as I&#x27;ve gotten older, and I couldn&#x27;t find a conditioner that I liked</li>
            <li>Pretty sure after trying these out</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel like a clean rinsing product but my hair looked clean.</li>
            <li>first few times I used this conditioner (along side the [[ASIN:B00MCGYXEO Beautiful Nutrition Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Shampoo]]), I noticed that my hair was staying softer and more manageable for a longer time.</li>
            <li>Wanted a more natural (not toxic), cruelty free line to help clean and smooth my shoulder length textured hair, which has to survive HOT, HUMID south Florida weather.</li>
            <li>the idea that I could use this conditioner the day before and simply skip a wash was very appealing.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is much lighter than typical conditioners making it great for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Seriously worth a try.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I&#x27;d seen a hair product claim that, and it really is true.</li>
            <li>felt very soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many conditioners over the years and the biggest problem I&#x27;ve had is getting the darn stuff to actually wash out.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love it, but it actually leaves my hair feeling dirtier, rather than cleaner, no matter how much I rinse.</li>
            <li>I have to fight the frizzy hairs on top and the straw-like condition that my hair tends to assume under both humid and dry conditions of the weather.  </li>
            <li>After using it you will notice that your hair just feels cleaner and is super soft.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Works very well and smells divine.</li>
            <li>It really shampooed and conditioner my hair very well.</li>
            <li>, it really feels zesty.</li>
            <li>What really proved it to me was that I saw the &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My hair was very snarly after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>I barely need to smooth it with a flat iron anymore - a quick light blow dry is all it needs.</li>
            <li>It seemed as if I could not get enough product to work through my hair, even though I put more than enough on my hair and on my ends.</li>
            <li>using this conditioner and the Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Shampoo, my hair was on the second day just like the first day.</li>
            <li>The premise of this conditioner is very unusual, and given that I have very long hair down to my bottom, I was really excited to try something so new.</li>
            <li>As someone with long hair, I really appreciate this!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo cleans,  conditions and detangles in a one-step process leaving hair soft, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have naturally oily hair or anything, I just feel</li>
            <li>I was actually really surprised to find that this conditioner lived up to its promise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m surprised at how well this product delivers on its promises.</li>
            <li>it is also 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>Not just because of how soft it leaves my hair, but from the &amp;#34;cleaner longer&amp;#34; effect I didn&#x27;t even realize it would have when I started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a person with very long hair, I&#x27;m usually suspicious of such claims because most of them simply aren&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>hair results are soft, moisturized, detangled,  and manageable with a silky clean shine that my course-textured, color-processed hair had only previously received after a visit to my hair</li>
            <li>My hair results are soft, moisturized, detangled,  and manageable with a silky clean shine that my course-textured, color-processed hair had only previously received after a visit to my hair salon.  </li>
            <li>and then the next morning tied my hair up into a bun and showered as normal but did not wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was traveling some last week and had to use a shampoo I had used many times in the past, and afterwards my hair was back to</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s old self, of having to be tamed with products by the next morning,</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m home and using these products again, and getting my hair back into the soft manageable shape</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m home and using these products again, and getting my hair back into the soft manageable shape</li>
            <li>The general condition of my hair is dry, therefore under normal conditions  </li>
            <li>Finally have my soft hair back!</li>
            <li>I still have to wash my hair everyday because it is fine and gets messy after a day and night.</li>

            <li> I still have to wash my hair everyday because it is fine and gets messy after a day and night.</li>
            <li> After using the Cleaner-Longer shampoo and conditioner, my wide-tooth comb slides through,  and there are none of the usual snarls that develop in longer length hair,  which are responsible for hair</li>
            <li> effect long before I ever read the description on the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have straight medium/short hair and my daughter has long thick curly/kinky hair.  </li>
            <li> Every shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used in the past, I would have to absolutely wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> other claim is that you could use this conditioner in place of a regular shampoo sometimes.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll be going back to my other brands.</li>
            <li> I take a shower every morning, but some mornings I don&#x27;t feel I have time to wash, condition, comb and style my very long hair, so</li>
            <li> Unlike other products that say shampoo and conditioner this one really feels thick and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> my hair style is VERY short, not sure I would like it with long hair.</li>
            <li> When I tried using it after shampooing, my hair was left feeling limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> By halfway through the  day after my hair has been washed, it looks rough.</li>
            <li> I have hair that falls limp and flat</li>
            <li> However, I have to say that usually skipping washing my hair makes me feel grimy and grungy for the entire day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I only needed half the amount I usually use.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo-conditioner, does NOT weigh hair down, and it removes any residue left by other shampoos and the hard water deposits that are prevalent in our area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner</li>
            <li> It removes any residue left over from both a detergent shampoo, and the mineral deposits in our hard water.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  It smells great but isn&#x27;t overpowering, and I don&#x27;t need to use a lot for it to be really effective.  As someone with long hair, I really appreciate this!  Toward the end of the bottle, it was harder to get the conditioner out, and the bottle does not stand upside down, but I put a little water in the bottle, which worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle to review, but this is an honest review.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery and had to find a product that would keep my hair looking good in between shampoos and this was it! Works very well and smells divine.</li>
            <li> It has little beads in this conditioner. It didn&#x27;t feel like a clean rinsing product but my hair looked clean. my hair style is VERY short, not sure I would like it with long hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  While I cannot say that my hair actually stayed cleaner for an extended period of time I did skip a day between shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I did like the lemony scent and my hair felt very soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it both in place of shampoo and after shampooing. The result without shampoo was hair that felt just as dirty as it had before I washed it. When I tried using it after shampooing, my hair was left feeling limp and lifeless. I wanted to love it, but it actually leaves my hair feeling dirtier, rather than cleaner, no matter how much I rinse.</li>
            <li> Cleaner Longer Shampoo &amp; Conditioner by Beautiful Nutrition is a one step process, producing phenomenal results, it cleans, conditions, moisturizes, and detangles with amazing effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have long, thick, course textured hair that has undergone the chemically color process treatment for over thirty years.  The general condition of my hair is dry, therefore under normal conditions  I have to fight the frizzy hairs on top and the straw-like condition that my hair tends to assume under both humid and dry conditions of the weather.  Another challenge that I face is the hard water in our area.  The mineral deposits of extra calcium and lime ruin anything that encounters the water, and soap and shampoo is difficult to rinse away.  Hard water leaves hair dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Nutrition is creamy with a medium consistency that glides over and through the hair.  The moisturizing and conditioning effects are immediate,  restoring  the nourishment that some shampoos may remove during cleansing.  This shampoo cleans,  conditions and detangles in a one-step process leaving hair soft, and manageable.  It removes any residue left over from both a detergent shampoo, and the mineral deposits in our hard water.  After using the Cleaner-Longer shampoo and conditioner, my wide-tooth comb slides through,  and there are none of the usual snarls that develop in longer length hair,  which are responsible for hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Cleaner-Longer shampoo for both, as a second wash for the conditioning properties after another harsher shampoo, and by itself alone,  as a one-step cleansing and conditioning  (moisturizing) process.  This shampoo-conditioner, does NOT weigh hair down, and it removes any residue left by other shampoos and the hard water deposits that are prevalent in our area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner Longer by Beautiful Nutrition does NOT contain synthetic dyes, colors, or fragrances.  This Paraben Free and DEA Free hair product is cruelty Free, not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair results are soft, moisturized, detangled,  and manageable with a silky clean shine that my course-textured, color-processed hair had only previously received after a visit to my hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Free, one bottle of Cleaner Longer - for an evaluation, and these are my personal results  during my three week trial period..

            <li> Doenst do what it said it does re keeps hair cleaner between shampoos.  Had to wash my hair again by the next day.  And I have tried using different shampoos.  I am disappointed because I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing on facebook that it helps your hair stay cleaner longer. I find it to be okay. Nothing spectacular at this point. It seemed as if I could not get enough product to work through my hair, even though I put more than enough on my hair and on my ends. Once I rinsed, I could feel that it was softer.  Smells really good.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this line of hair product, and I&#x27;ve tried many. Wanted a more natural (not toxic), cruelty free line to help clean and smooth my shoulder length textured hair, which has to survive HOT, HUMID south Florida weather. (I&#x27;m using with Beautiful Nutrition&#x27;s Citrus Pectin Healthy Hair Diet shampoo, Grapefruit Detox shine repair serum and Infrizzable hair cuticle corrector sealing serum finishing products - whichever is needed, not both at the same time). The best way to describe my hair now is calm and well adjusted. The fussy, unpredictable, dried out mess I had before is gone - in a matter of a couple of weeks. I barely need to smooth it with a flat iron anymore - a quick light blow dry is all it needs. Everyone in the family is using them and even my kids&#x27;  hair looks great when they wash themselves and barely brush. Seriously worth a try.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, conditions well, but can&#x27;t skip washing.</li>
            <li> The premise of this conditioner is very unusual, and given that I have very long hair down to my bottom, I was really excited to try something so new. Who wouldn&#x27;t like a conditioner which promises to keep your hair cleaner longer? I take a shower every morning, but some mornings I don&#x27;t feel I have time to wash, condition, comb and style my very long hair, so the idea that I could use this conditioner the day before and simply skip a wash was very appealing. However, I have to say that usually skipping washing my hair makes me feel grimy and grungy for the entire day and I just can&#x27;t stand it. I don&#x27;t have naturally oily hair or anything, I just feel unclean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was actually really surprised to find that this conditioner lived up to its promise. I tested it out and then the next morning tied my hair up into a bun and showered as normal but did not wash my hair. I was shocked to find that I didn&#x27;t feel grotty or dirty in any way. In fact, my hair still smelled fresh and clean though not fragranced, and had an attractive shine even though I&#x27;d slept on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other claim is that you could use this conditioner in place of a regular shampoo sometimes. I thought this sounded fun, because sometimes if you are at a gym or a hotel and don&#x27;t want to bring the whole array of products, it seems nice to just be able to use this. So I tested it out, and was shocked to find that I didn&#x27;t even feel I needed to shampoo the next day. It really shampooed and conditioner my hair very well. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever found a two in one product that actually works. Most of them focus on the shampooing and not on the conditioning, which leaves my hair frizzy and unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m surprised at how well this product delivers on its promises. As a person with very long hair, I&#x27;m usually suspicious of such claims because most of them simply aren&#x27;t true. But I&#x27;ve tried a number of items from this line and have been universally impressed. Though I received a sample for my honest review, I plan to continue purchasing this product once I finish my sample bottle.a sample for my honest review, I plan to continue purchasing this product once I finish my sample bottle.</li>
            <li> I felt and saw the difference almost immediately.  Not only does this conditioner smell great and feels great it is also 100% natural.  I loved that I could use this as both a shampoo and conditioner or just a conditioner.  Unlike other products that say shampoo and conditioner this one really feels thick and luxurious.  The other dual acting products never seem to condition, Beautiful Nutrition Cleaner Longer Rinse Out conditions beautifully.  My hair felt more fuller and voluminous.  I only needed half the amount I usually use.  I have straight medium/short hair and my daughter has long thick curly/kinky hair.  We both used it and both loved it.  My daughter has hair that turns frizzy easily and this conditioner worked wonders.  I have hair that falls limp and flat and this conditioner gave me a fullness and healthy glow.  I would recommend this product immensely.  I love the lemon peel zest and it lives up to it&#x27;s name, it really feels zesty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many conditioners over the years and the biggest problem I&#x27;ve had is getting the darn stuff to actually wash out.  I have fine hair and with that comes difficulty with most hair products.  What I love about [[ASIN:B00M7VB3QU Beautiful Nutrition Cleaner Longer Rinse Out Conditioner]] is that it&#x27;s different, and here&#x27;s why.  This conditioner is much lighter than typical conditioners making it great for my fine hair.  I also have oily hair (shows after just one day), so i have to wash it every day; using this Beautiful Nutrition conditioner, I find my hair is left soft and clean, just perfect.  The best part for me is it washes out without much fuss or hassle.  The hint of lemon is a nice touch and not overpowering.  Smells exactly like I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Finally have my soft hair back! It had been getting wiry as I&#x27;ve gotten older, and I couldn&#x27;t find a conditioner that I liked (coconut oil worked ok but I didn&#x27;t like that it made the shower so slippery). This stuff works better than the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> You know how some conditioners are impossible to rinse out of your hair? Well this is different. It is a lighter conditioner that is perfect for fine hair. After using it you will notice that your hair just feels cleaner and is super soft. I still have to wash my hair everyday because it is fine and gets messy after a day and night. But with this I notice my hair does not get quite as oily which makes me feel better. I could probably go a day without washing my hair if I chose to. I just love how shiny this makes my hair. Beautiful Nutrition really does make some naturally good products. I&#x27;m in love with everything lemon that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free bottle for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> After using an entire bottle of this conditioner, I&#x27;m hooked. Not just because of how soft it leaves my hair, but from the &amp;#34;cleaner longer&amp;#34; effect I didn&#x27;t even realize it would have when I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used this conditioner (along side the [[ASIN:B00MCGYXEO Beautiful Nutrition Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Shampoo]]), I noticed that my hair was staying softer and more manageable for a longer time. Every shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used in the past, I would have to absolutely wash my hair every other day. No way around it. By halfway through the  day after my hair has been washed, it looks rough. If I have got hair products in it to make it behave, they&#x27;ve weighed my hair down and made it look a mess. If I don&#x27;t have hair products in, my hair is a frizz ball of chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But using this conditioner and the Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Shampoo, my hair was on the second day just like the first day. And even more amazing, by the morning after that, a full 48 hours after washing it, it still looks great! Course I still go ahead and get a shower and wash my hair. But wow, 48 hours after washing my hair and I can wake up with soft fluffy hair instead of a bent, frizzy, awkward mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few washed with this, I then noticed on the bottle it says &amp;#34;Cleaner Longer&amp;#34;. It was the first time I&#x27;d seen a hair product claim that, and it really is true. What really proved it to me was that I saw the &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; effect long before I ever read the description on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Nutrition has some awesome hair products. Pretty sure after trying these out there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll be going back to my other brands. I was traveling some last week and had to use a shampoo I had used many times in the past, and afterwards my hair was back to it&#x27;s old self, of having to be tamed with products by the next morning, the day after day I washed it. And a horrid mess the following morning after that, when I made a mad dash for the shower. Now I&#x27;m home and using these products again, and getting my hair back into the soft manageable shape it was in prior to the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for reviewn I made a mad dash for the shower. Now I&#x27;m home and using these products again, and getting my hair back into the soft manageable shape it was in prior to the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this conditioner.  My hair was very snarly after rinsing it out.</li>
