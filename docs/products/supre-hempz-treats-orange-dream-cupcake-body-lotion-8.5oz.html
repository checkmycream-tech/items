            <li>I just love this lotion, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same Hempz quality with wonderful scent options for the holidays--nothing like them.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried them</li>
            <li>It was ok to try.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and thickness of lotion.</li>
            <li>i have really enjoyed this lotion.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more of this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Like most women, I cannot eat all the baked goods I would like, but I can \\&quot;wear\\&quot; them.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful product that I had to order two!</li>
            <li>The treats smell yuummmyyyy, hydrate beautifully, and My sensitive allergic to everything</li>
            <li>This lotion is just the BEST for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is a very moisturizing lotion and keeps skin hydrated and smelling good throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It is great that it contains Hemp and other things that are great for the skin, and no artificial ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and is not sticky on the skin.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quick.</li>
            <li>It is thick, absorbs nice &amp; smells GREAT!!  </li>
            <li>All the other scents are just as great, but those stick out the most to me.  </li>
            <li>Really does smell like a cupcake , and I love how its sweet smelling without being to powerful and overwhelming</li>
            <li>The smell is too sweet and morphs into something even stinkier.</li>
            <li>The other two got great compliments.</li>
            <li>I like this fragrance a lot but wish it would last longer - it is nice after a bath or shower.</li>
            <li>my first grader son says that mommy smells &amp;#34;Yummy&amp;#34; and wanted to try some himself.</li>
            <li>This (Orange Cream Cupcake) is my second favorite out if the three I have tried.</li>
            <li>anyway, the scent of this one smells pretty head on with an orange cupcake.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!  </li>
            <li>It came exactly on time</li>
            <li>i was hesitant at first because i thought it would be watery and sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty rich, moisturizes well, the scent is nice but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>It comes in other scents, which I actually prefer, but it is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Orange Dream Cupcake Lotion has a very pungent sharp edge to it, I was dreaming of a softer warm orange vanilla baking scent.</li>
            <li>and then when I move - very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>Let alone at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and this has really helped</li>
            <li>Would love to try the other scents!</li>
            <li>I wish the other scents on Amazon were this cheap...</li>
            <li>I dilute it with other lotion and enjoy it that way.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly without that greasy feeling most other lotions leave you with and now that&#x27;s it&#x27;s been about a half an hour</li>
            <li>Well the price was irrisistable and im ready to try their next scent.</li>
            <li>maybe a 12 year old girl.</li>
            <li>Like all Hempz lotions I have tried, it is fullbodied and works really well on dry skin.</li>
            <li>This product was rich, thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li>So thick and rich and not greasy</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s really smooth, the orange isn&#x27;t a fake citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> Less expensive lotions work better.</li>
            <li> have every single scent by this brand.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other scented lotions in the Hempz line.</li>
            <li> I think the manufacturer had some issues with the color on this one - it is a rather muddy orange color, not very appealing.</li>
            <li> I got addicted to this brand of lotion when i got mini sizes inside a local TJ Maxx store.</li>
            <li> These are not easy to find.</li>
            <li> and when I used it on my legs and feet this morning, I put my white socks on and the lotion left orange marks all over the socks. :(  </li>
            <li> I usually like the Hempz products</li>
            <li> Which is my biggest complaint with orange scented stuff.</li>
            <li> I reccomend Hempz ad a lotion, this scent just kinda sucks.</li>
            <li> Also, the consistency seems weird and heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about the Hempz Triple Moisturizer Herbal Whipped Body Creme</li>
            <li> Still stuck with this bad blend of smells.</li>
            <li> Sadly the lotion smells horrible.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed with the scent.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about the Hempz Triple Moisturizer Herbal Whipped Body Creme so I thought I&#x27;d give this scent a try as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the bottle the luscious cake smell is evident, with the delightful Dreamsicle orange notes coming through once you start rubbing it in. It absorbs quickly without that greasy feeling most other lotions leave you with and now that&#x27;s it&#x27;s been about a half an hour I can say that the delightful cake aroma is still fragrant on my skin. I catch a whiff of it every now and then when I move - very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Even my first grader son says that mommy smells &amp;#34;Yummy&amp;#34; and wanted to try some himself. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells delicious and I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other scented lotions in the Hempz line. Hmm...Strawberry Cheesecake or Butter Pecan...decisions, decisions!!</li>
            <li> Discovered this line in a discount store.  I have been seeking out the product ever since.  It is great that it contains Hemp and other things that are great for the skin, and no artificial ingredients.  Fan for life.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so yummy and the smells stays with you throughout the day, doesn&#x27;t fade!! Would love to try the other scents!</li>
            <li> smells like tanning lotion from a tanning bed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty rich, moisturizes well, the scent is nice but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ALL THE FRANGRANCES......BUT I LOVE EVEN MORE HOW IT FEEL SO SATINY ON MY SKIN AND FEET.</li>
            <li> This (Orange Cream Cupcake) is my second favorite out if the three I have tried. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I got addicted to this brand of lotion when i got mini sizes inside a local TJ Maxx store. These are not easy to find. At all. Let alone at a reasonable price. I was pretty impressed they had this one here on Amazon for $6 for 8.5oz. I paid $4 for a mini in TJ Maxx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, the scent of this one smells pretty head on with an orange cupcake. It&#x27;s really smooth, the orange isn&#x27;t a fake citrusy scent. Which is my biggest complaint with orange scented stuff. I just love this lotion, though. I wish the other scents on Amazon were this cheap... I&#x27;d stock up if they were.</li>
            <li> Great lotion--wish they&#x27;d keep making the treats line!  It&#x27;s the same Hempz quality with wonderful scent options for the holidays--nothing like them.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion it smells so delicious:)</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last that long, but it does smell like a orange cupcake. I would recommend it to my friends and family to buy.</li>
            <li> The treats smell yuummmyyyy, hydrate beautifully, and My sensitive allergic to everything skin adores them!!!  So glad I tried them, now i have too many choices of smell!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion, because I could only IMAGINE what it would smell like......unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t smell like I thought it would and when I used it on my legs and feet this morning, I put my white socks on and the lotion left orange marks all over the socks. :(  My bottle came in wihtout a seal on it, too.  Don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference, but I was leary to use it without a seal under the lid.  Maybe they just don&#x27;t have seals? I wouldn&#x27;t order it again. It was ok to try.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this type of lotion because I like the brand. Sadly the lotion smells horrible. However I contacted the company and they offered to give me a discount on a different lotion. Still stuck with this bad blend of smells.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites!!  It is thick, absorbs nice &amp; smells GREAT!!  I highly recommend it!!  Going to buy more &amp; stock up!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent and thickness of lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion alone is reason enough to purchase! It is a very moisturizing lotion and keeps skin hydrated and smelling good throughout the day. I would definitely recommend it! On my second bottle!</li>
            <li> Ordered the strawberry cheesecake and lemon squares as well. This one just isn&#x27;t that great smelling. The other two got great compliments. I reccomend Hempz ad a lotion, this scent just kinda sucks.</li>
            <li> i have really enjoyed this lotion. It goes on easily and is not sticky on the skin. I plan on buying more of this product. And it does smell like an orange cupcake.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just the BEST for my very dry skin. It comes in other scents, which I actually prefer, but it is a great moisturizer. I think the manufacturer had some issues with the color on this one - it is a rather muddy orange color, not very appealing. But it works well!</li>
            <li> It came exactly on time but I was disappointed with the scent. Smells like play-doh.</li>
            <li> Smells like an orange cream popsicle. It is a bit thicker though than I am used to from this brand. Well, for the price it is a great deal and it didn&#x27;t give me any rash or anything. So go for it!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Shipped very quick. Smells great and feels good.</li>
            <li> This brand is the best brand of lotion i have ever used.  The best scents by this brand is Orange Dream Cupcake, Strawberry Cheesecake, Triple Berry Swirl and Sugar Lemon Squares.  All the other scents are just as great, but those stick out the most to me.  And not only the scent, but the way it moisturizes is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have every single scent by this brand. Best. Lotion. ever.</li>
            <li> OMG! This lotion goes on like butter and smells like a dream..i was hesitant at first because i thought it would be watery and sticky.Well the price was irrisistable and im ready to try their next scent.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll smell like a creamsicle pop! creamy and you&#x27;ll want to eat it. but, ya.. don&#x27;t.  :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I remember.For the price I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.Smells nice but that&#x27;s about it.Less expensive lotions work better.</li>
            <li> Smells gross and seems sticky. I did not like this. The smell is too sweet and morphs into something even stinkier. Not a scent for a grown woman...maybe a 12 year old girl. Also, the consistency seems weird and heavy. I usually like the Hempz products but this one misses the mark. Would not buy this or anything from this line again.</li>
            <li> This product was rich, thick and creamy.  I would recommend buying a larger bottle as the amount of product that is advertised as being in the bottle does not seem to match up.</li>
            <li> Orange Dream Cupcake Lotion has a very pungent sharp edge to it, I was dreaming of a softer warm orange vanilla baking scent. The idea is good and the ingredients are good, no parabens, glutens or mineral oils.I dilute it with other lotion and enjoy it that way.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance a lot but wish it would last longer - it is nice after a bath or shower.</li>
            <li> The lotion feels great on and the fragrance is light.  I am in a pool a lot and this has really helped</li>
            <li> So thick and rich and not greasy</li>
            <li> Like most women, I cannot eat all the baked goods I would like, but I can \\&quot;wear\\&quot; them. This lotion has a wonderful, but not overpowering, scent which does not overwhelm once it&#x27;s out of the bottle and on the skin. Like all Hempz lotions I have tried, it is fullbodied and works really well on dry skin. It is a good price too. My only wish is that it came in a larger Hempz pump bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand lotion I have ever used. It moisturizes without making your hands greasy. I like the way this one smells too. It&#x27;s like a creamsicle.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. If youth could be bottled, this would be it! I only wish you could smell it call day.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product that I had to order two! It has a delicious smell and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really does smell like a cupcake , and I love how its sweet smelling without being to powerful and overwhelming this is one of my favorites.</li>
