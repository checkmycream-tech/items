            <li> I get little chin hairs that is unattractive. This tweeze doe a great job in removing the hairs from the root. It pulls hairs that a hand tweezer can&#x27;t grip. After tweezing, the skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> The item does not work, I have one I had ordered years age from the tweeze website and  I had to go back to using it because the new one from Amazon does not grab any hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother and it seems to work pretty well.  However, the construction is cheap and the clear top broke shortly after we got it.</li>
            <li> it hurts cuz the edges arent soft! So when you use it the epilator peels your skin and because you have to use it alot to get some hairs off it can be hurtful! It bothers me cuz you really have to pass the epilator numerous times to get little results! It is useless and hurtful!!!</li>
            <li> I love it this is a geat price for a great product.  This is the 2nd one I have bought.</li>
            <li> This just does not do the job. After using it I&#x27;m still tweezing to get all the hairs that didnt get tweezed with this thing.</li>
            <li> terrible doesnt work more than a day &amp; only for face its not worth anything havent even used it once</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere in my area so searching and identifying it easily on Amazon was a tremendous relief. I even went to a store that specialized in selling &amp;#34; As seen on t.v.&amp;#34; products with no luck. I had never been to the Amazon website before but I was really impressed with the ease of availability of just about anything you may be looking for.  Once i had my purchased item, I was pleasantly surprised with how the product works. I think it&#x27;s better then what I had anticipated. It wasn&#x27;t just a gimmick. Overall, a wonderful buying experience. I can&#x27;t wait to find another hidden gem.</li>
            <li> I considered the NONO but the price was out of sight! So I decided to try this and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without this handy secrete.  So fast and easy!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it.  I know it seems like a good idea, but don&#x27;t do it.  Not just this unit, but any of these styles of hair removers.</li>
            <li> Great for those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> This is cheaply made and it broke the first day I used it. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Product works well. Must hold at 90 degree angle and use lightly across skin and it tweezes ok.  Makes maintaining of facial hair easy and is far better than using Nair.</li>
            <li> No not a no-no. Got a lot of great reviews but personally I don&#x27;t know where those came from. It&#x27;s painful for sure if you are using it on your face, as in my case. I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all, then I read that it pulls out one hair at a time. OMG. I&#x27;ll be in the mirror for the next century. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> works pretty good not 100 percent. does miss some hair but otherwise it does the job. small enough to carry with you.</li>
            <li> seems to have been used before!&lt;br /&gt;does not work I think it must have been a return.</li>
            <li> love this product and its very effective. i  keep buying them</li>
