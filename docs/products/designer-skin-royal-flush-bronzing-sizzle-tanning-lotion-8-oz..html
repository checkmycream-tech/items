            <li>It has nothing to do with berry anything, but more with old cheap Avon granny perfume.</li>

            <li>This lotion is great, not a very strong tingle but works immediately.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described &amp; has just the right amount of tingle!</li>
            <li>I have always been a bronzer kind of gal... and the only time I had used tingle before - was on accident</li>
            <li>This is an intense tingle, And I like it!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you put this on last and wipe your hands</li>
            <li>I use a lot of tingle lotions, this one is not a real powerful tingle but leaves a nice color.</li>

            <li> I like this lotion. Doesn&#x27;t make me smell funny like most lotions.like it so much I got a total of 3 bottles</li>
            <li> This is an intense tingle, And I like it! It bears a scent similar to the perfume Exclamation. I love this lotion and WILL be buying this again.</li>
            <li> For the price of this tanning lotion you can&#x27;t beat it. It smells great too. I love the tingle in it it&#x27;s not to much. You go and find this at any tanning place you will be paying way more for it. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Made my skin red and itchy. And I don&#x27;t usually have sensitivities to lotions.</li>
            <li> Very Good lotion it Instantly darkens skin Gives a rich, deep and dark tan, not orange. Feels refreshing after tanning and great smell. Does leave you red after tanning because it’s a tingle but it goes away after a few hours. The shipping was fast. I got it in no time</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all. I did not even get a base tan. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months back but finally got to use it today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tingle is pretty intense, but not like the JWoww stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the smell.... It&#x27;s like someone else said - A grandmother&#x27;s perfume. But imagine if your grandmother is a smoker and lends you her sweater because you are cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like your grandma&#x27;s borrowed old smokey sweater and her perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use this stuff again. Ugh!</li>
            <li> No tan.  When I got out of the bed I was redder than the devil&#x27;s. ...&lt;br /&gt;But no tan.  Smells decent.</li>
            <li> I love this...I get great color when using it.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect tingle for people who don&#x27;t like the strong tingle effect that leaves u super red and itchy after</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion instantly made me ill. It has nothing to do with berry anything, but more with old cheap Avon granny perfume. I put the smallest dab on my arm I the smell lingered so long I got a migraine.</li>
            <li> Love...love....love this product! It is exactly as described &amp; has just the right amount of tingle! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I started tanning and my legs just never ever tan.  After about 2 weeks, I bought a sample and used it.  I love that my legs get darker but I feel like my legs are going to melt everything I touch... It&#x27;s something you can get used to, but it&#x27;s not bad for a beginner tingle.  I was told it is only a \\&quot;T10\\&quot; so thats a level 10 tingle and they can go all the way up to T200 or T300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I bought a bottle after my sample pack ran out.  Just make sure you put this on last and wipe your hands or else you might spread it places you dont want to have tingle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great lotion for if you have parts that just wont tan at all :)</li>
            <li> Smells really good and I got good color.</li>
            <li> Designer Skin has done it again with another fabulous product. Smells amazing AND is the perfect tingle/bronzer combination. I have always been a bronzer kind of gal... and the only time I had used tingle before - was on accident and I will never forget the next couple of days after that! Royal Flush has just enough tingle for me to handle while bronzing me up quicker than the normal bronzer!! I don&#x27;t tan that often at all (usually just before vacations), so the acceleration of color and amazing smell is perfect for me! #musthave</li>
            <li> Love this lotion .has a tingle and smells ok.I would order this lotion again.Delivery was fast.Gives you a good color</li>
            <li> Nice for the price. This doesn&#x27;t have all of the bronzes that leave streaks. The tingle effect isn&#x27;t too strong for me and it has a pleasant scent. It isn&#x27;t my favorite but it does the job. I just use this as a backup when I get low on my other lotions.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Have used it off and on since it came out. The smell is amazing. The lady at the salon I tan at has been asked what kind of lotion I use by other clients that can smell it after I&#x27;ve left and like the smell. I use a lot of tingle lotions, this one is not a real powerful tingle but leaves a nice color.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, not a very strong tingle but works immediately. The itch goes away with two hours. Lotion smells great and even better after the tan. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> this lotion was amazing and it doesnt eat ur pocket book on price....i could tll an immediate diffrence&gt; When i got done with my sample i bought a bottle. if u like a tingle u will like this product. it also has a good smell.</li>
            <li> The tingle is way too intense in this. Yes, it gets me tan, even after the first session, but the tingle is way too strong. It leaves me blotchy and in pain for at least 2 days after I&#x27;ve tanned and washed it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> this is a very hot lotion. the smell is awesome. it moiturized good while tanning and you feel the tingle about 5 minutes into your session.it took about 3 hours for  heat to go away for me.</li>
            <li> I think I get a good color when I use this product, however I was not expecting the tingle sensation to be so intense. I&#x27;ve never used a tan accelerator or anything like it and it was pretty scary the first time I used it. My skin went bright red and I raced home to shower it off as quick as possible. The tingle and hot feeling lasted a few hours. Now that I know it&#x27;s meant to happen (after reading up on it) it&#x27;s something I can bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reckon if you have used tingle stuff before its good, but for a beginner I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. If there was something slightly milder I would go for that instead. Overall a good tan, good smell, good price and there is deffinately a big tingle from it!</li>
