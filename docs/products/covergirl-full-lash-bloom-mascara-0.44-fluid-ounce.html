            <li>One of the best that i have used in a while.</li>
            <li>One of the best things about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t flake on me nor does it smudge, I can even wear it on my bottom lash line and not have to worry about it smearing all over.  </li>
            <li>It allows for an even coat and flawless separation of the eyelashes.</li>
            <li>That being said, the coverage isn&#x27;t awesome.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li>it does a great job on the lashes, it lengthens and separates without looking clumpy.</li>
            <li>The brush cleaner in the tube isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>I also experienced no flaking, even after sleeping in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>about $8, this is a great mascara.</li>
            <li>Gives great volume and separation.</li>

            <li>Perhaps if it was waterproof then I would have loved it.</li>
            <li>but I tried this out and loved it.</li>
            <li>I felt like it didnt have good color to it.</li>
            <li>The brush is so unique and covers/separates your lashes for a beautiful look!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and it always looks great when you put it on.</li>

            <li>and that is very important!</li>

            <li>It makes my lashes look soo much better than what I used to use (great lash).</li>
            <li>I love the definition and this mascara is great for building length as well.</li>

            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Covergirl Lash Blast mascara&#x27;s, so I was expecting to fall in love with this one as well!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who desires longer and more natural-looking lashes!</li>
            <li>but I still love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, I do love the formula!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>

            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!</li>
            <li>The verdict is in, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>I love that it is touchable, all day!</li>
            <li>this was the first time ive used this, and i am very happy.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this Bloom Mascara!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>You eyelashes will look flawless and beautiful, but still big and plump.</li>
            <li>I did find that when I used a lengthening mascara and then added the full bloom mascara on top of them my lashes looked great!</li>
            <li>This mascara is amazing</li>
            <li>I would replace the wand with a non-plastic one and this would be an amazing mascara.</li>
            <li>but this mascara is just amazing.</li>
            <li>This mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li>Came out AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The brush is amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, stays in great throughout the day and never gets flaky.</li>
            <li>I really liked the packaging and</li>
            <li>and I always give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Using 2 coats will make it look kind of clumpy.</li>
            <li>and I always give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a nice job of lengthening eyelashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mascara has a nice formula and the brush helps you get every lash without feeling like you are going to poke yourself in the eye.</li>
            <li>but they kind of make my eyelashes &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It would make it so much easier to remove the mascara before bed :D</li>
            <li>got the perfect rounded tip to do that without stabing yourself in the eye, haha.</li>
            <li>opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working nicely.</li>
            <li>but I have really liked this mascara.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and doesn&#x27;t leave any clumps.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.</li>
            <li>Nicely outlines each lash without clumping - all the way to the tip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually nice to have mascara that I don&#x27;t want to scrub and scrub to get off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have had to use about 3 coats to get the kind of coverage that would be noticeable.</li>
            <li>What I loved the most about the mascara was that it did a great job at separating my eyelashes and making them look full.</li>
            <li>I received this mascara from influenster, the brush is very fine and spread out so ppl like me can wiggle through lashes and volumize them I love it!</li>
            <li>Full Bloom spread my eyelash and created great length.</li>
            <li>and I love how is is cheap and affordable but still a great product.</li>
            <li>This looks good and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is also very easy to remove and does not smear when applying it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>&amp; it just keeps getting better and better over time!</li>
            <li>I was able to try this mascara through Influenster for testing purposes and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>It was just as great as the original Lash Blast as well as the Clump Crusher which was my favorite mascara before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using CoverGirl Clump Crusher for awhile but thought I&#x27;d give this a try to see if I liked it even better.</li>
            <li>The price is great, for well worth it.</li>
            <li>It looks great and is definitely worth the store value.</li>
            <li>I Liked and enjoyed using this mascara</li>
            <li>This is a great drug store mascara and is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump &amp; maximizes the volume of my lashes for an easy daytime look!</li>
            <li>Plus it comes off every easily!</li>
            <li>I have to say I loved testing this mascara complimentary of influenster!</li>
            <li>One coat is perfect for natural looking lashes, but if you want anything more than that</li>
            <li>This is definitely a worthy buy!!</li>
            <li>I thought the formula was very smooth</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;d like to say that this product is very nice and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard for me to find a mascara that works and doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes together, well this is awesome, it works very good.  </li>
            <li>and i did the week challenge and loved it my eyelashes feel extremely healthy and its not hard to remove and gives awesome length, it also builds very well.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it!</li>
            <li>Although this wasn&#x27;t waterproof for me, I did love how it gave my lashes length and made it more prominent.</li>
            <li>Will be buying now that it is winter :)</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>my lashes are a million times longer when i wear it :)</li>

            <li>Anyone who has tried SoftLashes would LOVE this.</li>
            <li>The advice I would give us you don&#x27;t need more than 2 coats otherwise it gets clumps.</li>
            <li>There is no clumping, the look I get when I apply it is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I got this complimentary from Influenster to try out and review, and it really a good mascara, but I&#x27;d recommend buying it from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>It separates my lashes and curls them, but I still think my L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Voluminous mascara works better in volume.</li>
            <li>My favorite things about it:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look fantastic!</li>
            <li>Such sleek packaging and a very very good product!</li>
            <li>and I actually love it.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>I love the shape of the brush</li>
            <li>For me it only takes 2 coats for my lashes to look flawless.</li>
            <li>Love how light weight the mascara feels as well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day for over a week, and overall I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dior Iconic Overcurl mascara for a while now, and this will not replace it; it just doesn&#x27;t do for my lashes what Dior does.</li>
            <li>I have, however, tried using this as a second coat over the Dior mascara, and the results are great!</li>
            <li>I have tried many mascaras and this one is without a doubt in my top 3.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute and the brush is also cute.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the amount of product that dispenses on the wand.</li>
            <li>I literally don&#x27;t get clumps with this even if I try 2 or more coats.</li>
            <li>, I think! :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>Overall though I was really impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t love a product that tests on animals.</li>
            <li>, I enjoyed the results, but believe my reaction may not have been from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I really love the way it make my lashes look</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to buy some more because the complementary bottle I got from influenster is almost gone because I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li>I actually love this mascara.</li>
            <li>im sure</li>
            <li>this would just make them even better), but this is a mousse formula so if you arent a fan of those id advice you not to get this one. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I received this mascara free to review from Inluenster, all opinons are my own*</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Like many people have said, it gives length and volume without the cumpiness that most mascaras that advertise \\&quot;volume\\&quot; give.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the way this product looked once applied.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I love the brush on this.</li>
            <li>The product was ok.</li>
            <li>Even better, it stays on all day but comes off with ease when I take it off with my face wipes.</li>
            <li>so I can return here and change my review to 5 stars. :)</li>
            <li>I got this in a covergirl voxbox, and I am so glad they showed it to me.</li>
            <li>I love that it did not clump and look like I was applying coat after coat.</li>
            <li>I actually really enjoyed using this product.</li>

            <li>It is a pretty good mascara if you know how to use it, but it takes a while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>All in all though this mascara is pretty good.</li>
            <li>After using Cover Girl Full Lash Bloom Mascara I really liked what it did to my eyelashes.</li>

            <li>I do my best to use alternate brands with more animal friendly lines.</li>
            <li>Influenster sent me this to try out for review and I was so excited!</li>
            <li>This is a great new formula.</li>
            <li>It is great for a more natural looking lash that is not clumpy.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary full sized product from Influenster and It is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>some of those wound up transferring to my lashes, but after I went over the areas a few times, the brush did an excellent job of distributing that product and ensuring that my lashes continued to be nicely separated.  </li>
            <li>I received this product from complimentary from Influenster and am so glad I did!</li>

            <li>in all i think it is completely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>I think that if your going for a bold night look then this is not the mascara for you, however people who enjoy day looks and very modest approaches to makeup are going to love this!</li>
            <li>I was also able to remove it very, very easily with just warm water and a little bit of Dove soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I was super excited.</li>
            <li>I got this mascara as a complimentary gift from Influenster for testing purposes, and I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I admit that I color shop and specifically buy makeup that is in a pink container, but this mascara is actually a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan over Covergirl mascaras and this was no disappointment.</li>
            <li>I would recommend 2 coats for the full effect.</li>
            <li>it is Full Lash Bloom by Covergirl.</li>
            <li>Good for teens just starting out in mascara.</li>
            <li>Probably not something that I would use for a night out, but for an every day basis it gives a nice, natural look.</li>
            <li>Full Lash Bloom Mascara was so weightless and did not leave my eyelashes all clumped up.</li>
            <li>I love that this mascara adds so much lenth and volume to my lashes and is so lightweight.</li>
            <li>Out of all the mascara I have tried, the Full Lash Bloom makes my lashes look the longest.</li>
            <li>Plus, you would end up using up the product much sooner than another better formulated mascara.</li>
            <li>I was given for review purposes the CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara, by Influenster.</li>
            <li>These made my eyelashes look gorgeous, and lasted an entire workday.</li>
            <li>I received a full size of Lash Bloom Mascara courtesy of Influenster.</li>
            <li>I cannot make any complaints about the full lash bloom formula.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me the full length that I like</li>
            <li>And these types of wants are my favorite.</li>
            <li>FULL DISCLAIMER:</li>
            <li>Full Lashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a full review on my YouTube channel</li>
            <li>I received cover girl full lash bloom mascara through my vox box from Influenster.</li>
            <li>although most mascaras cause my eyelash line to hurt this one is very gentile while still giving a full look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now thanks to the free full size sample from Influenster!</li>
            <li>As a contact wearer, it is crucial that it is suitable and opthalmologically tested!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara it doesn&#x27;t bulk up like most mascara.it give your eyelashes a lil fullness and make your eyes seem a lil bigger</li>
            <li>The brush is awesome because it spreads the mascara out enough that it costs the lashes immensely but doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>Super lightweight and doesn&#x27;t clump or flake.</li>
            <li>The drying time was really quick and the product did not smudge during the day when I rubbed my eyes.</li>
            <li>and it actually super affordable.</li>
            <li>My makeup will look perfect and beautiful, then I&#x27;ll apply this and a few hours later it&#x27;s on my upper and lower eyelid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an OK mascara for people with normal eyes.</li>
            <li>This mascara is more amazing than I expected!</li>
            <li>Of all makeup products, mascara is a pretty important one in my book</li>
            <li>I liked other mascaras by COVERGIRL better.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very pretty</li>

            <li>Full Lash Bloom Mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing</li>
            <li>The listing price of $17 is a little high for drugstore mascara, but if you can snag for &amp;#60;$10, it&#x27;s an excellent buy.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>This mascara is one of my new favorite mascara&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have to say, this is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite</li>
            <li>and I love their products, but the new Covergirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Great black color, doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>This mascara was great at defining lashes and lasted at least 8hrs or so before becoming a bit flaky for me.</li>
            <li>Love the texture it leaves my eyelashes, very natural look and not clumpy at all.</li>
            <li>as the product says, it is a very soft mascara, which i love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used CoverGirl mascara before, but this is my favorite so far!</li>
            <li>and I instantly fell in love!</li>
            <li>Definitely will be buying more!</li>
            <li>It is a very light and soft formula.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute and pink is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight, goes on very smooth, and last all day.</li>
            <li>If you have fine / short, go for a more specialized formula.</li>
            <li>This mascara is easy to apply and relatively clump free, but it smudges and flakes pretty easily leaving you with raccoon eyes within a couple hours.</li>
            <li>The brush is very nice and firm so it can really comb through easily.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look long and full and best there isn&#x27;t a single clump!</li>
            <li>It does go on smooth though and doesn&#x27;t really clump for me.</li>

            <li>I am a HUGE fan of mascara and this really blew me away.</li>
            <li>It is great for everyday though as it doesn&#x27;t clump up and gives my lashes a fuller apperance.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Unlike everyone else who posted a review, I actually bought this product with MY OWN MONEY and did not receive it from Influencer;</li>

            <li>I received this mascara as complimentary for testing purposes by Influenster</li>
            <li>Many mascaras will make my lashes look longer, but not add a natural looking volume.</li>
            <li>I was sent this product by Influenster and completely feel in love with it.</li>

            <li>I also got this from Influenster, and it&#x27;s easily my favorite product so far.</li>

            <li>I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster</li>
            <li>I received a free full sized tube of this in the mail a little over a week ago from Influenster, and let me just say, I love it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to continue to build on the overall look of this mascara without ruining my eyelashes with clumpy awfulness!.</li>
            <li>When I applied it to my lashes, I quickly realized that this product does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>But, other than that, I loved the volume and length it gavee me.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the adorable packaging my favorite color is pink</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good mascara, it doesn&#x27;t clump up as much as other brands, but I did not notice a difference after a week.</li>
            <li>I received the Cover Girl Full Lash Bloom free from Influenster, I was given this free to submit my review, and was not paid in any form for the following review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I received the covergirl full lash bloom mascara free from Influenster, I was given this free to submit my review, and was not paid in any form for the following review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent for the price if you&#x27;re looking for a somewhat quality mascara for cheap.</li>
            <li>I normally prefer a larger thicker brush, but with this formula, the brush provided seems to do a good job of separating my lashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara is the perfect blend of touchable and dramatic.</li>
            <li>I used CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom for a week, thanks to Influenster.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t remember the last time I bought drug store mascara because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely sold on this and will absolutely buy more when this one runs out!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in brown since I enjoy that Covergirl makes the best true brown mascaras, but I still use the black for more dramatic looks.</li>
            <li>and she even asked me what kind of mascara I used because she said they looked so long without any clumps.</li>
            <li>This worked out great for me because I have full long lashes and it gives you that extra lift.</li>
            <li>It leaves my lashes so soft and full!</li>
            <li>No mascara has ever made my lashes look as natural than Full Lash Bloom has!</li>
            <li>Overall, great new product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new mascara.</li>
            <li>It is really the best mascara I&#x27;ve used in a long long time!!</li>
            <li>I will admit right off the bat that I am spoiled to my lash extensions, and that this is the first mascara I have used in almost 3 years.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be ordering it again!</li>
            <li>Good black color</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara to use if you want natural looking lashes, especially using just one coat of the mascara.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday definitely would suggest to a friend!</li>
            <li>I love my lashes to look long and full and this does just that.</li>
            <li>It comes off pretty easily with make up remover but lasts pretty much the whole day.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product especially for the price!!</li>
            <li>I recieved a full size sample of covergirl full lash bloom completely complementary from influenster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and leaves your lashes feeling soft.</li>
            <li>#gobloom is such a fun campaign :)I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li>Very Black free from Influenster for product testing purposes and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>Gave a fair amount of volume, and lengthened a little bit, but as it doesn&#x27;t specialize in either--</li>
            <li>far as the downsides are concerned, I didn&#x27;t have any issues at all with smudging even on my lower lashes, but there was some flaking -- it wasn&#x27;t a huge amount, but it did happen.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried cover girls mascara</li>
            <li>i like it a lot especially since most mascaras make your eyelashes look over done.</li>
            <li>covergirl never fails me</li>
            <li>Definitely do not use more than 2 coats or your eyelashes</li>
            <li>This is this first cover girl mascara</li>
            <li>I have used several top brands and they were more than double the price of this</li>
            <li>Will absolutely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>I  received the this product complimentary from Influenster, and I tried it for seven whole days to test it out.</li>
            <li>It never clumps and it makes my eyelashes look so much longer!</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>and I am glad to say I finally found it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE COVERGIRL mascaras and wear it daily.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this mascara and will definitely continue to recommend!</li>
            <li>I tried this product out for seven days straight, even forgot to remove it one night, with no issues!</li>
            <li>It holds a curl pretty well too.</li>
            <li>My eyes looked bigger for sure</li>
            <li>I will totally be buying this every time I need more mascara.</li>
            <li>Overall I love this product and will surely be buying in the future.</li>
            <li>I received the CoverGirl Full Lush Bloom Mascara complimentary from Influenster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took part in the 7-day challenge to see how much Lash Bloom Mascara grew on me and to see how it enhanced my look over time!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it, really!</li>
            <li>When there&#x27;s too much product on the wand, that&#x27;s when you get clumps!</li>
            <li>Once I applied it to my freshly curled lashes they immediately went straight.</li>
            <li>first application of the mascara</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are also very short, so I feel like they aren&#x27;t able to get into my lashes to provide volume, even if the formula could.</li>
            <li>The best part is it&#x27;s not overly expensive.</li>
            <li>Once this one runs out, I&#x27;m definitely willing to buy this again.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty mascara in both packaging and the wear.  </li>
            <li>and I really really like using this mascara!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product and I plan to purchase more once my current bottle runs out!</li>
            <li>I personally like to look like I have more than three eye lashes, and this helps me do that.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;d argue its better than many of the more expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It provides length, volume, and curl to my straight lashes!</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product as a good everyday mascara.</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time I immediately loved the results, it did not leave my lashes stiff that they hurt to move them but made them stay in place.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have mentioned that this mascara is perfect for a natural, effortless looking eyelash look, and they&#x27;re entirely correct.  </li>
            <li>I wore it throughout the whole work day without any flaking or smudging, and at the end of the day it melted right off with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I wore it throughout the whole work day without any flaking or smudging, and at the end of the day it melted right off with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Seeing as mascara is the one product that I absolutely must wear daily, I was quite excited to be able to try this as a brand new product.</li>
            <li>I have found that it&#x27;s a great everyday mascara for natural makeup</li>
            <li>I have found that it&#x27;s a great everyday mascara for natural makeup</li>
            <li>The brush is different than others I&#x27;ve tried, in that it&#x27;s more flexible and rubbery, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>I received this mascara from my influenster box and although I love that it leaves your lashes soft and natural looking</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anybody who wants their lashes to look good everyday.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be sent the COVERGIRL Full LashBlast Mascara by Influenster.</li>
            <li>soft full lashes.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Normally I can layer nonwaterproof formulas over a waterproof one with success, but this one would uncurl my lashes even over a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good everyday mascara!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, my lashes were soft.</li>
            <li>It does have a dry formula which isn&#x27;t pleasing to everyone, but I personally love it.</li>
            <li>, the one downside is that the longer I use it the more dry the formula becomes.  </li>
            <li>Its very build able &amp; super black on the lashes too.</li>
            <li>I recently received COVERGIRL&#x27;s Full LashBloom by LashBlast Mascara complimentary for testing purposes through Influenster.</li>
            <li>oh my gosh...let me just say that after a week of using it, I went ahead and bought a few more for myself, my sisters, and my mom!</li>
            <li>I received this mascara complimentary from influenster and WOW!</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great mascara that won&#x27;t flake off and leave you eyes looking black.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I always try every single new version of the Lash Blast mascara, because the original is my favorite mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried (I like it even more than the more expensive, designer brands I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li>Pretty good, not exceptional.</li>
            <li>I also loved how my lashes felt soft and not hard as if I used other mascaras.</li>
            <li>Very little if any clumping and very light weight!</li>
            <li>i would really keep on buying this product again</li>
            <li>I really was unsure about it when I was reading the description that came with it in my Influenster box which I received to review it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put five stars in the review because rvrn though I really like this mascara</li>
            <li>and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>What I realized worked to not make my lashes clump so much, is to sort of blink onto the brush, which really brushes them out and makes them branch out.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>so I tend to be really picky about what I wear.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Personally I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>My lashes look very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; with this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t clump together and it feels weightless.</li>
            <li>I have been searching and searching for a drugstore mascara that I really like</li>
            <li>The tube is a cute pink color, which doesn&#x27;t affect the performance</li>
            <li>This is gentle and not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>You have to get really close to your eye.</li>
            <li>Thanks @Influenster</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and didn&#x27;t flake off too much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very picky about the ones I like</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, it makes my eyelashes look so much longer</li>
            <li>I think Covergirl should have their whole &amp;#34;Lash&amp;#34; line of mascaras infused with the beewax that&#x27;s in this mascara.</li>
            <li>It is not waterproof, but does not smudge much.</li>
            <li>I put two coats on and it stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li>It is softer and don&#x27;t clump as much.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive this mascara from Influenster to try out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very buildable mascara that provides a lot of length and definition.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara and could see myself purchasing it in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this mascara since it coats the whole lash very well.</li>
            <li>I received one to try from Influenster and it&#x27;s worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>I really like how the mascara fans out my lashes and separates them.</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to mascara.</li>
            <li>and I really do like it.</li>
            <li>It really lengthens your lashes and the color</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the price</li>
            <li>This mascara was given to me free from Influenster, and I am a total mascara junkie.</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Normally, I would try my trick of applying waterproof first, then applying a coat of a non waterproof mascara, but I did not.</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway, Influenster.</li>
            <li>As you can see from my before and after picture my lashes are much fuller and this is just one coat of mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple uses, I started to really like the mascara.</li>
            <li>My lashes did not clump, and I gained so much volume.</li>
            <li>but  it really gets the products in the root of my lash.</li>
            <li>It does not give me any fall out which I appreciate so much.</li>
            <li>and just want my lashes to look like real lashes</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It lengthens my lashes really well and doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have spider legs on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>I will give this 5 stars because it really does everything it promises.</li>
            <li>Overall, I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>and it really did lengthen my lashes with just once coat.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use mascara</li>
            <li>It was really blah for me.</li>
            <li>so it is really reliable.</li>
            <li>with that in mind, i think this would be great on false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>mascara by benefit, but it is a good everyday natural mascara.</li>
            <li>I love trying out new ones and have tried a variety of different brands, from drug store to high end.</li>
            <li>Great mascara for a subtle natural look!</li>
            <li>It lasts all day long and comes off easy with makeup wipes.</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t super wet and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall if you have long lashes, this mascara is great to add extra volume and length.</li>
            <li>It is still a bit stuff, but much better than other brands.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy over time like so many other mascaras.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wore it everyday for a week and love how full and natural</li>
            <li>Your lashes will feel super soft and natural like there&#x27;s nothing even on it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and leaves lashes soft and full, and there&#x27;s little to no clumping!</li>
            <li>The brush is great too- not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li>I have long straight light lashes.</li>
            <li>I found that even though I really had to apply quite a bit of the product, the brush worked wonders in terms of keeping my lashes separated, so that I could see the full effect of the formula in terms of the aforementioned length and volume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super dramatic which makes it a perfect daily mascara and appropriate for work.  </li>
            <li>Before recieveing this product, I thought all mascara was the same, but this type is excellant because of the special shape of the bristles.</li>
            <li>It also comes off very easily with makeup remover wipes without leaving black all around my eyes!</li>
            <li>It is very natural and light but guys me the big lashes that I want!</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this as long as it is available from Cover Girl.</li>
            <li>I was sent this mascara by Influenster for free to use for a week, but I&#x27;m still using it long beyond that.  </li>
            <li>The brush separates your lashes but having to apply so many coats to get any difference in volume is not worth the effort or time.</li>
            <li>I add several layers to my lashes to make them full.</li>
            <li>It gives you a smooth and natural look, so I definitely recommend this product and really hope that someday soon they will stop testing on animals</li>
            <li>It does flake of pretty easily though and leaves black marks on my cheeks, so I have to look in myself in the mirror every so often.</li>
            <li>even if you layer on the product, but what you will see is a fair amount of volume and length with a decent amount of pigmentation so that the final look is pretty but not overdone, and your lashes will still feel soft and not even a little &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live this product!</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found a new go-to!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually very hesitant to try new mascaras just because once I find one that works for me, I&#x27;d like to stick with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a decent mascara for the money.</li>
            <li>This is a decent mascara by Covergirl.</li>
            <li>Clever thinking by developers.</li>
            <li>But this is still a decent mascara</li>
            <li>It gave a decent amount of volume, and did not appear to clump while I was applying it.</li>
            <li>I only drop it to four stars because it is not paraben free or natural.</li>
            <li>So, for everyone looking for a decent mascara, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d regret giving this one a try.</li>
            <li>I like this particular product mainly because of the petal-shaped brush.</li>
            <li>It really meets it&#x27;s goal at making your eyelashes soft and just makes them Bloom!</li>
            <li>I was sent this mascara to try by Influenster, and I did not have high hopes.</li>
            <li>The application process was very smooth, I often have trouble with my eyelashes clumping with this mascara</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is definitely a high quality mascara for the price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I love the color and how it doesn&#x27;t make them too wild looking unlike some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have used other CoverGirl products before and this mascara so far is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Pretty Long Lasting and easy to take off at the end of the day with a make up</li>
            <li>They also do leave your lashes soft to the touch unlike many other mascaras I have used.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a little over a week and am in love.</li>
            <li>While I do like the length that this mascara gave to my lashes, I still felt that it clumped up a little more than I would have preferred.</li>
            <li>I received this product from Influenster.com a little over a week ago, and I love it.</li>
            <li>At first I was sketchy because of the rather large brush and tube but it has not only made them look longer</li>
            <li>It is easy to take off with one wipe, as opposed to the two wipes I normally use to take off other mascaras.</li>
            <li>I am usually pretty picky about mascara because I have long lashes and its hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t clump and looks good.</li>
            <li>if your like that whole natural look</li>
            <li>The mascara, is soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t really like it on my natural eyelashes,</li>
            <li>This makes my eyelashes look long and full.</li>
            <li>For a drug store buy, I&#x27;d recommend for people with normal length/ thickness lashes.  </li>
            <li>Most mascaras that give you length also clump of look too heavy.</li>
            <li>This is definitely something worth trying.</li>
            <li>My lashes appeared way longer than normal and well defined.</li>
            <li>All in all I really like this mascara, I definitely would recommend it if you are someone like me that has sparse eyelashes and just want to make them look a little better without getting to dramatic (or if you already have great eyelashes</li>
            <li>My lashes are not clumped together and they are not hard at all.</li>
            <li>It thickens and separates your lashes a bit better than plain Lashblast.</li>
            <li>My lashes are naturally super long</li>
            <li>I have used it for a week now and unfortunately other than it veing free, i wouldnt recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>You can check out my blog http://christinasharnelle.blogspot.com/ to see how I got to try this product and other products for free from influenster.</li>
            <li>So I got this new product in the</li>
            <li>so I am always looking for new mascaras to make them longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>I was in need of new mascara and was unsure what to buy when my GoBloom VoxBox arrived.</li>
            <li>and I can say that it is new \\&quot;go to\\&quot; mascara.</li>
            <li>have pretty long lashes already, so it isn&#x27;t a problem to me that this mascara doesn&#x27;t do much for lengthening or volumizing.</li>
            <li>Typically my mascara loses its effect by mid afternoon, but this one looked impressive until I got home around 7pm.</li>
            <li>have pretty long lashes already, so it isn&#x27;t a problem to me that this mascara doesn&#x27;t do much for lengthening or volumizing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised at the length it gives my lashes and it goes on nice and thick, hugging all my lashes.</li>
            <li>I have been a longtime fan of the LashBlast macaras, but this one has an even better formula that I can use right away instead of waiting for it to dry out a little to its optimal texture.</li>
            <li>and it has cute little flowers on it!</li>
            <li>I have very blonde lashes and this makes them look long thick and gorgeous!</li>
            <li>This is a very natural looking mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, and doesn&#x27;t clump or  make my lashes feel still.</li>
            <li>This is a very natural looking mascara</li>
            <li>This Full Lash Bloom mascara does what other high costing mascaras do for about 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li>It is so lightweight and makes my lashes feel so soft!</li>
            <li>There is no clumping and it is so natural looking!</li>
            <li>I have completed the 7-day challenge and have seen personally how much Lash Bloom Mascara has enhanced my look!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, either!</li>
            <li>I have always been a bit put off with the small bristles of most mascaras</li>
            <li>but I was surprisingly surprised that my eye lashes did not clump!</li>
            <li>I like it a lot so far!</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described by Covergirl - a softer mascara that does not short you on volume or length.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look normal and soft.</li>
            <li>so it clumps somewhat, but it really gives my barely there</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;d like a more dramatic coat, just apply more coats rather than a single layer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake over the course of a day, it&#x27;s a great dark black for just enough drama!</li>
            <li>the hot pink color really makes it stand out</li>
            <li>I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster to review, and I opened the package without a single expectation.</li>
            <li>Recently something changed with the formula and my beloved mascara became unusable due to extreme clumping.</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s not a perfect product, but with multiple coats, the resulting lash look is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I like a very volumizing mascara, as I have very long lashes and don&#x27;t need much length.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this product, but was let down by the quality.</li>
            <li>I have learned that if I use several coats of mascara then it&#x27;ll help lengthen the lashes a little more.</li>
            <li>The problem I have with most mascaras is that they leave my eye lashes clumpy and they&#x27;re hard to take off.</li>
            <li>It worked well and looked natural when I just used one coat of it, but when I tried it with the second coat they ended up looking very clumpy.</li>
            <li>Overall it gives a great look, but application and removal is difficult.</li>
            <li>As far as getting it off goes, I had to resort to vaseline -- NOT</li>
            <li>It is not heavy</li>
            <li>It gave my lashes a natural look</li>
            <li>but it will bend like natural lashes.</li>
            <li>It make them look longer darker while looking natural.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li>It is weightless and that&#x27;s the way I enjoy my makeup while I am on the go everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a girl who loves soft, natural looking lashes and this mascara</li>
            <li>like how, like it says your eyelashes stay soft after application.</li>
            <li>for those days where I just wanted a soft natural look this was my go to mascara.</li>
            <li>In this product leaves them soft and clump-free.</li>
            <li>My lashes remained soft, and I did not experience any flaking.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I have been having many issues with my eyes lately</li>
            <li>It gives you voluminous, soft lashes and a bit of curve.</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every drugstore brand mascara on the market</li>
            <li>No complaints so far</li>
            <li>With Lash Bloom, my lashes still feel soft and malleable to the touch.</li>
            <li>It gives me soft, natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse short eyelashes</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it for 7 days</li>
            <li>it is natural looking no mascara chunks or caking&lt;</li>
            <li>I recommend it for people looking for a natural look.</li>
            <li>It does leave you lash soft.</li>
            <li>It gives you a natural, no clumpy look.</li>
            <li>This mascara gives my lashes a really natural look without the clumping.</li>
            <li>I have stick straight Asian lashes and I knew once I saw that it was not waterproof it would not work.</li>
            <li>In order to really amp up the look, and see noticeable lengthening, volumizing, and pigmentation, you&#x27;ll likely need to use 3 coats.  </li>
            <li>, I have extremely sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>The packaging does not lie when it says it will leave your lashes soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>and it last the whole day through all my classes.</li>
            <li>It was extremely natural, and didn&#x27;t clump at all.</li>
            <li>My lashes felt soft to the touch abd didn&#x27;t clump together.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and no irritation.</li>
            <li>looks natural.</li>
            <li>but I guess my eyes are just too sensitive for it.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 18 year old, she used it once and threw it out.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for natural looking mascara, this is a mascara for you.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long eye lashes, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned about the length.</li>
            <li>I didnt want to put it near my eye balls.</li>
            <li>It gives your lashes a natural lift exposing and beautifying your eye.</li>
            <li>I think I lost a few too many of my eyelashes during the several weeks</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes full and dark, with quite a bit of length.</li>
            <li>Id definitely say its more of an everyday mascara for me, but its like my go to mascara when im in a hurry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long-time devotee of a name-brand, expensive mascara that I loved because I didn&#x27;t need to curl my lashes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay mascara, but it&#x27;s not amazing.</li>
            <li>This mascara seemed very dry right from the start.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, normally I always have a dark Smokey eye, with dark eyeliner, eye shadow, and the one product I can&#x27;t live without mascara.</li>
            <li>As the package suggests, it did make your lashes very soft, however, I am not sure that this is a huge issue that warrants</li>
            <li>Very Black free from Influenster for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>Very Black free from Influenster for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>Very Black free from Influenster for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>I received this mascara in very black from influenster free to try and review.</li>
            <li>I received this mascara free from Influenster in the shade Very Black.</li>
            <li>I really am just not giving this mascara a full 5 star review because it is not waterproof and unfortunately their brand still tests on animals which is something that I don&#x27;t give my support to, but I received a complimentary sample from Influenster to try, so</li>
            <li>Other than that totally worth a try for price</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look really full and long, but not too long.</li>
            <li>This color is very black but really doesn&#x27;t feel like that is more like black.</li>
            <li>It is not flaky or dry and gives you full yet long lashes.</li>
            <li>and I have been using this the past 4 days ( huge shocker for me).</li>
            <li>I already have long lashes so it didn&#x27;t really make a difference to me.</li>
            <li>Not necessarily meaning you have to put on a lot of coats, just that it&#x27;s not thick and clumpy looking or feeling.</li>
            <li>I actually like because I normally use maybelline</li>
            <li>Very minimal volume, this is NOT a dramatic mascara!</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to mascara, and I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new mascara.</li>
            <li>Generally I purchase higher name brand like Dior, Tarte, etc.. and never really considered Covergirl.</li>
            <li>It is not flaky or dry and really spreads out the lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always envied the ones with long lashes and have tried several products promising to help with lash growth or even mascaras promising those long lush looking lashes with just one application.</li>
            <li>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use this on a daily basis, just because it doesn&#x27;t volumize my lashes as much as I wish it did.</li>
            <li>I use multiple coats for color and length, and it does really well without getting clumpy or gross.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as good as their professional series, which is my current favorite.</li>
            <li>Lasted all day and left my lashes soft !</li>
            <li>More for a natural look rather than a dramatic look.</li>
            <li>The color is dark but it still comes off natural looking, and it didn&#x27;t clump too much (but it did once or twice).  </li>
            <li>It actually was soft and didn&#x27;t flake off like some mascaras do.</li>
            <li>You can barely tell that the mascara is on.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural look to your lashes, it doesn&#x27;t give extra volume, yet it gives enough to lift your lashes and make it look as glamorous as it should naturally.</li>
            <li>I love this product I got it about a month ago from the Influenster Team and my eye lashes look so thick and long.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for any woman who wears mascara all the time and wants it to look natural with no flaking or wearing down.</li>
            <li>I get asked almost every day if I have fake lashes because they look so full, long, and pretty!!</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this for the busy college student who wants to add a little pop to her every day makeup routine or the busy working woman!</li>
            <li>When you put it on your lashes are soft and have volume without all the flaking and smudging that you normally get from other mascaras.</li>
            <li>The beeswax makes them feel much softer than other mascaras, too.</li>
            <li>I was excited, to say the least.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes feeling hard and gross like a lot of mascaras do.</li>
            <li>Well, I tried to figure out what the issue was, either the dry weather or the new mascara.</li>
            <li>I like a more dramatic look to my lashes but</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get as much volume as I would like, but honestly no mascara really gives me the volume I want.</li>
            <li>For the very FIRST time I got NO FLAKING, which is what would make me buy this mascara again in the future, since all the other mascaras that I tried end up clumping after they dry.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it&#x27;s kind of difficult to remove, even with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li>I had a major problem with clumping every time I wore this mascara, and that is the sole reason this gets 3 stars.</li>
            <li>I love that it does not make my lashes feel hard or smudge throughout the day like other mascaras I have used.</li>
            <li>This mascara is very nice for casual everyday use.</li>
            <li>It goes on great, separates each lash and gives it crazy volume!</li>
            <li>I also do not think it gives much length especially compared to other mascaras.</li>
            <li>I also do not think it gives much length especially compared to other mascaras.</li>
            <li>Other mascaras have left my lashes very crunchy and sometimes cause them to fall out.</li>
            <li>the black from the mascara really made my lashes pop.</li>
            <li>Seemed to be a bit old because it&#x27;s a bit dry when applying.</li>
            <li>After several hours, it started falling off and my eyelashes went back to looking bare.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply because of the thin and correct consistency.</li>
            <li>first application I thought this was just an ordinary mascara and wasn&#x27;t really any different than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Normally, that would be a recipe for disaster, as so many other mascaras clump, giving us those unsightly and uncomfortable &amp;#34;spider&amp;#34; lashes.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave black marks around your eyes when you look down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great day mascara; something to use when you want length but don&#x27;t want CRAZY dark or long lashes like you&#x27;d maybe want for a night out.</li>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t believe that this mascara gives the best volume that it claims to give.</li>
            <li> Must say this one of the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake and it look flawless alll day.</li>
            <li> Best eye make up I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this mascara gives the best volume that it claims to give.</li>
            <li> Excellent at lengthening &amp; separating.</li>
            <li> Best paired with a thickening mascara to achieve fullness and length.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> I believe this is one of the best mascaras that they have</li>
            <li> does that PERFECTLY!</li>
            <li> I received Lash Bloom by Covergirl from Influester and have nothing but great things to say about it!</li>
            <li> If it was, it would be the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> I was given this mascara to test from Influenster, and I must say I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> It was one of the best mascaras I have used from Covergirl.</li>
            <li> It lengthened and separated, and I was very impressed that it came off fully when I used makeup wipes or washed my face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  </li>
            <li> This mascara is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the greatest</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump, keeps my curl, and the best part, you can remove it with makeup removing wipes!</li>
            <li> but this mascara does both perfectly!</li>
            <li> and I have to say I was impressed!</li>
            <li> Great volume and look!</li>

            <li> It gave me perfect lashes every time I used it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump and does an excellent job thickening and lengthening!</li>

            <li> Received this product compliments of Influenster and their awesome program!</li>
            <li> and I have to say that this product is perfect!</li>
            <li> One of the best that i have used in a while.</li>
            <li> One of the best things about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t flake on me nor does it smudge, I can even wear it on my bottom lash line and not have to worry about it smearing all over.  </li>
            <li> It allows for an even coat and flawless separation of the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> That being said, the coverage isn&#x27;t awesome.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!</li>

            <li> This mascara is amazing!!</li>
            <li> It is the ideal brush for mascara application.</li>
            <li> This was a good one, for its price range!</li>
            <li> and I loved it!</li>
            <li> Loved it while it lasted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the CoverGirl mascaras and this one did not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I loved this mascara!</li>

            <li> It makes me feel naturally beautiful.</li>
            <li> My lashes look beautiful.</li>
            <li> This was an exceptional product for its price range!</li>

            <li> Great retail price, great length, and great brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a week (and have used it every day) and haven&#x27;t experienced any of those problems.</li>
            <li> i got this as a part of the influencer program and it wears great without  clumping</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great every-day mascara.</li>
            <li> it does a great job on the lashes, it lengthens and separates without looking clumpy.</li>
            <li> The brush cleaner in the tube isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> I also experienced no flaking, even after sleeping in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> about $8, this is a great mascara.</li>
            <li> Gives great volume and separation.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great if you are not looking for volume or length, but just to coat what you already have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week and have been happy with the mascara.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product.</li>

            <li> I loved how my lashes felt day after day.</li>
            <li> Its good</li>
            <li> but its still a good product.</li>

            <li> which is something I always look for in a good mascara.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> Over all it is a good mascara wished I had received it in water proof.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge and lasts a good 12 hours before it needs reapplying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I loved it and gave it 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a week of using the mascara I have REALLY loved the product.</li>
            <li> but I do think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> smooth and just one coat makes my lashes look great and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> My sister also loved it.</li>
            <li> I get good volume without the flakes.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if it was waterproof then I would have loved it.</li>
            <li> but I tried this out and loved it.</li>
            <li> I felt like it didnt have good color to it.</li>
            <li> The brush is so unique and covers/separates your lashes for a beautiful look!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and it always looks great when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I have been using the CoverGirl full lash bloom mascara for seven days as a beauty challenge and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The mascara is nice and light, doesn&#x27;t clump and looks great!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> and that is very important!</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary mascara courtesy of Influenster, and was very impressed!</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look soo much better than what I used to use (great lash).</li>
            <li> I love the definition and this mascara is great for building length as well.</li>
            <li> 1 coat works great, but 2 is even better</li>
            <li> Best mascara out there right now.</li>
            <li> and I can say I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the quality!</li>
            <li> I love it, it doesn&#x27;t flake off and it lasts all day!</li>

            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Covergirl Lash Blast mascara&#x27;s, so I was expecting to fall in love with this one as well!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who desires longer and more natural-looking lashes!</li>
            <li> but I still love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, I do love the formula!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!</li>

            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!</li>
            <li> The verdict is in, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I love that it is touchable, all day!</li>
            <li> this was the first time ive used this, and i am very happy.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this Bloom Mascara!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> You eyelashes will look flawless and beautiful, but still big and plump.</li>
            <li> I did find that when I used a lengthening mascara and then added the full bloom mascara on top of them my lashes looked great!</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing</li>
            <li> I would replace the wand with a non-plastic one and this would be an amazing mascara.</li>
            <li> but this mascara is just amazing.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li> Came out AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, stays in great throughout the day and never gets flaky.</li>
            <li> I really liked the packaging and</li>
            <li> and I always give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Using 2 coats will make it look kind of clumpy.</li>
            <li> and I always give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a nice job of lengthening eyelashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mascara has a nice formula and the brush helps you get every lash without feeling like you are going to poke yourself in the eye.</li>
            <li> but they kind of make my eyelashes &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It would make it so much easier to remove the mascara before bed :D</li>
            <li> got the perfect rounded tip to do that without stabing yourself in the eye, haha.</li>
            <li> opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working nicely.</li>
            <li> but I have really liked this mascara.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and doesn&#x27;t leave any clumps.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> and I honestly don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.</li>
            <li> Nicely outlines each lash without clumping - all the way to the tip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually nice to have mascara that I don&#x27;t want to scrub and scrub to get off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have had to use about 3 coats to get the kind of coverage that would be noticeable.</li>
            <li> What I loved the most about the mascara was that it did a great job at separating my eyelashes and making them look full.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from influenster, the brush is very fine and spread out so ppl like me can wiggle through lashes and volumize them I love it!</li>
            <li> Full Bloom spread my eyelash and created great length.</li>
            <li> and I love how is is cheap and affordable but still a great product.</li>
            <li> This looks good and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is also very easy to remove and does not smear when applying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> &amp; it just keeps getting better and better over time!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this mascara through Influenster for testing purposes and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> It was just as great as the original Lash Blast as well as the Clump Crusher which was my favorite mascara before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CoverGirl Clump Crusher for awhile but thought I&#x27;d give this a try to see if I liked it even better.</li>
            <li> The price is great, for well worth it.</li>
            <li> It looks great and is definitely worth the store value.</li>
            <li> I Liked and enjoyed using this mascara</li>
            <li> This is a great drug store mascara and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump &amp; maximizes the volume of my lashes for an easy daytime look!</li>
            <li> Plus it comes off every easily!</li>
            <li> I have to say I loved testing this mascara complimentary of influenster!</li>
            <li> One coat is perfect for natural looking lashes, but if you want anything more than that</li>
            <li> This is definitely a worthy buy!!</li>
            <li> I thought the formula was very smooth</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say that this product is very nice and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard for me to find a mascara that works and doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes together, well this is awesome, it works very good.  </li>
            <li> and i did the week challenge and loved it my eyelashes feel extremely healthy and its not hard to remove and gives awesome length, it also builds very well.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it!</li>
            <li> Although this wasn&#x27;t waterproof for me, I did love how it gave my lashes length and made it more prominent.</li>
            <li> Will be buying now that it is winter :)</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> my lashes are a million times longer when i wear it :)</li>
            <li> I recently got this awesome mascara in the mail to test it out for influenster I&#x27;ve tried it for about a week</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free as a tester via Influenster, and I&#x27;m head over heels!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from Influenster and I love it.</li>
            <li> ; I love how it doesn&#x27;t clump up my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> As mascara is probably my go to product, I have tried many mascaras over the years.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t look or get clumpy!!! :)</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that Influenster sent me a free tube of it to try out!</li>
            <li> I was and still am thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it!</li>
            <li> Mascara runs, no volume, clumps after more than one coat.&lt;br /&gt;Positives:</li>
            <li> It also helps that the packaging is so cute 😊</li>
            <li> Actually, it&#x27;s the best by them to me.</li>
            <li> and I love using it.</li>
            <li> Mascara is my favorite makeup accessory and I am always looking for the next best thing.</li>
            <li> So Influenster gave me the opportunity to test this product for free!</li>
            <li> Got this from #influenster and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> The mascara has a great formula that does not clump and is very buildable.</li>
            <li> I  love how cover girl packaged this mascara</li>
            <li> and I love the plastic applicator.</li>
            <li> so I love the tube</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I love the packaging.</li>
            <li> I also love that they use beeswax in their formula to provide buildable volume.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be even better than Clump Crusher.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara to test by Influenster and I absolutely LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I love how it applies and how it looks :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thinking of getting more</li>
            <li> I am so glad my search is over.</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li> I love the brush because I try to bring out the ends of my lashes and its</li>
            <li> Overall, another awesome product from Covergirl.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not so sure which one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I really love them both.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> and I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> It lasted several hours, without flaking or smudging, gave me incredible lift and volume!</li>
            <li> this mascara is OK.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love it,</li>
            <li> I enjoy it!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has tried SoftLashes would LOVE this.</li>
            <li> The advice I would give us you don&#x27;t need more than 2 coats otherwise it gets clumps.</li>
            <li> There is no clumping, the look I get when I apply it is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I got this complimentary from Influenster to try out and review, and it really a good mascara, but I&#x27;d recommend buying it from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> It separates my lashes and curls them, but I still think my L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Voluminous mascara works better in volume.</li>
            <li> My favorite things about it:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look fantastic!</li>
            <li> Such sleek packaging and a very very good product!</li>
            <li> and I actually love it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite mascara</li>
            <li> I love the shape of the brush</li>
            <li> For me it only takes 2 coats for my lashes to look flawless.</li>
            <li> Love how light weight the mascara feels as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day for over a week, and overall I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dior Iconic Overcurl mascara for a while now, and this will not replace it; it just doesn&#x27;t do for my lashes what Dior does.</li>
            <li> I have, however, tried using this as a second coat over the Dior mascara, and the results are great!</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras and this one is without a doubt in my top 3.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cute and the brush is also cute.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the amount of product that dispenses on the wand.</li>
            <li> I literally don&#x27;t get clumps with this even if I try 2 or more coats.</li>
            <li> , I think! :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> Overall though I was really impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t love a product that tests on animals.</li>
            <li> , I enjoyed the results, but believe my reaction may not have been from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I really love the way it make my lashes look</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to buy some more because the complementary bottle I got from influenster is almost gone because I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li> I actually love this mascara.</li>
            <li> im sure</li>
            <li> this would just make them even better), but this is a mousse formula so if you arent a fan of those id advice you not to get this one. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free to review from Inluenster, all opinons are my own*</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Like many people have said, it gives length and volume without the cumpiness that most mascaras that advertise \\&quot;volume\\&quot; give.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the way this product looked once applied.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I love the brush on this.</li>
            <li> The product was ok.</li>
            <li> Even better, it stays on all day but comes off with ease when I take it off with my face wipes.</li>
            <li> so I can return here and change my review to 5 stars. :)</li>
            <li> I got this in a covergirl voxbox, and I am so glad they showed it to me.</li>
            <li> I love that it did not clump and look like I was applying coat after coat.</li>
            <li> I actually really enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to have, it doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on really evenly.</li>
            <li> It is a dryer formula, which I personally love.</li>
            <li> It has amazing staying power, is easy to use, and gives beautifully full lashes!</li>
            <li> and I know that is very rare for some mascara!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying and trying this mascara, I am sure you will love it!!</li>
            <li> Super pleased!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own special product line of mascara.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good mascara if you know how to use it, but it takes a while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> All in all though this mascara is pretty good.</li>
            <li> After using Cover Girl Full Lash Bloom Mascara I really liked what it did to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It volumizes, lengthens, and helps keep lashes soft while still looking beautiful.</li>
            <li> I do my best to use alternate brands with more animal friendly lines.</li>
            <li> Influenster sent me this to try out for review and I was so excited!</li>
            <li> This is a great new formula.</li>
            <li> It is great for a more natural looking lash that is not clumpy.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary full sized product from Influenster and It is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> some of those wound up transferring to my lashes, but after I went over the areas a few times, the brush did an excellent job of distributing that product and ensuring that my lashes continued to be nicely separated.  </li>
            <li> I received this product from complimentary from Influenster and am so glad I did!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan over Covergirl mascaras and this was no disappointment.</li>
            <li> I would recommend 2 coats for the full effect.</li>
            <li> it is Full Lash Bloom by Covergirl.</li>
            <li> Good for teens just starting out in mascara.</li>
            <li> Probably not something that I would use for a night out, but for an every day basis it gives a nice, natural look.</li>
            <li> Full Lash Bloom Mascara was so weightless and did not leave my eyelashes all clumped up.</li>
            <li> I love that this mascara adds so much lenth and volume to my lashes and is so lightweight.</li>
            <li> Out of all the mascara I have tried, the Full Lash Bloom makes my lashes look the longest.</li>

            <li> And these types of wants are my favorite.</li>
            <li> FULL DISCLAIMER:</li>

            <li> As a contact wearer, it is crucial that it is suitable and opthalmologically tested!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara it doesn&#x27;t bulk up like most mascara.it give your eyelashes a lil fullness and make your eyes seem a lil bigger</li>
            <li> The brush is awesome because it spreads the mascara out enough that it costs the lashes immensely but doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>

            <li> The drying time was really quick and the product did not smudge during the day when I rubbed my eyes.</li>

            <li> My makeup will look perfect and beautiful, then I&#x27;ll apply this and a few hours later it&#x27;s on my upper and lower eyelid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an OK mascara for people with normal eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is more amazing than I expected!</li>
            <li> Of all makeup products, mascara is a pretty important one in my book</li>
            <li> I liked other mascaras by COVERGIRL better.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very pretty</li>

            <li> Full Lash Bloom Mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing</li>
            <li> The listing price of $17 is a little high for drugstore mascara, but if you can snag for &amp;#60;$10, it&#x27;s an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> This mascara is one of my new favorite mascara&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite</li>
            <li> and I love their products, but the new Covergirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Great black color, doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> This mascara was great at defining lashes and lasted at least 8hrs or so before becoming a bit flaky for me.</li>
            <li> Love the texture it leaves my eyelashes, very natural look and not clumpy at all.</li>
            <li> as the product says, it is a very soft mascara, which i love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used CoverGirl mascara before, but this is my favorite so far!</li>
            <li> and I instantly fell in love!</li>
            <li> Definitely will be buying more!</li>
            <li> It is a very light and soft formula.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute and pink is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight, goes on very smooth, and last all day.</li>
            <li> If you have fine / short, go for a more specialized formula.</li>
            <li> This mascara is easy to apply and relatively clump free, but it smudges and flakes pretty easily leaving you with raccoon eyes within a couple hours.</li>
            <li> The brush is very nice and firm so it can really comb through easily.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look long and full and best there isn&#x27;t a single clump!</li>
            <li> It does go on smooth though and doesn&#x27;t really clump for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I received it from Influenster free of charge for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of mascara and this really blew me away.</li>
            <li> It is great for everyday though as it doesn&#x27;t clump up and gives my lashes a fuller apperance.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Unlike everyone else who posted a review, I actually bought this product with MY OWN MONEY and did not receive it from Influencer;</li>

            <li> I received this mascara as complimentary for testing purposes by Influenster</li>
            <li> Many mascaras will make my lashes look longer, but not add a natural looking volume.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product by Influenster and completely feel in love with it.</li>

            <li> I also got this from Influenster, and it&#x27;s easily my favorite product so far.</li>

            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster</li>
            <li> I received a free full sized tube of this in the mail a little over a week ago from Influenster, and let me just say, I love it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to continue to build on the overall look of this mascara without ruining my eyelashes with clumpy awfulness!.</li>
            <li> When I applied it to my lashes, I quickly realized that this product does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> But, other than that, I loved the volume and length it gavee me.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the adorable packaging my favorite color is pink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara, it doesn&#x27;t clump up as much as other brands, but I did not notice a difference after a week.</li>
            <li> I received the Cover Girl Full Lash Bloom free from Influenster, I was given this free to submit my review, and was not paid in any form for the following review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I received the covergirl full lash bloom mascara free from Influenster, I was given this free to submit my review, and was not paid in any form for the following review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent for the price if you&#x27;re looking for a somewhat quality mascara for cheap.</li>
            <li> I normally prefer a larger thicker brush, but with this formula, the brush provided seems to do a good job of separating my lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the perfect blend of touchable and dramatic.</li>
            <li> I used CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom for a week, thanks to Influenster.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t remember the last time I bought drug store mascara because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely sold on this and will absolutely buy more when this one runs out!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in brown since I enjoy that Covergirl makes the best true brown mascaras, but I still use the black for more dramatic looks.</li>
            <li> and she even asked me what kind of mascara I used because she said they looked so long without any clumps.</li>
            <li> This worked out great for me because I have full long lashes and it gives you that extra lift.</li>
            <li> It leaves my lashes so soft and full!</li>
            <li> No mascara has ever made my lashes look as natural than Full Lash Bloom has!</li>
            <li> Overall, great new product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new mascara.</li>
            <li> It is really the best mascara I&#x27;ve used in a long long time!!</li>
            <li> I will admit right off the bat that I am spoiled to my lash extensions, and that this is the first mascara I have used in almost 3 years.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> Good black color</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara to use if you want natural looking lashes, especially using just one coat of the mascara.</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday definitely would suggest to a friend!</li>
            <li> I love my lashes to look long and full and this does just that.</li>
            <li> It comes off pretty easily with make up remover but lasts pretty much the whole day.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I recieved a full size sample of covergirl full lash bloom completely complementary from influenster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and leaves your lashes feeling soft.</li>
            <li> #gobloom is such a fun campaign :)I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li> Very Black free from Influenster for product testing purposes and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Gave a fair amount of volume, and lengthened a little bit, but as it doesn&#x27;t specialize in either--</li>
            <li> far as the downsides are concerned, I didn&#x27;t have any issues at all with smudging even on my lower lashes, but there was some flaking -- it wasn&#x27;t a huge amount, but it did happen.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried cover girls mascara</li>
            <li> i like it a lot especially since most mascaras make your eyelashes look over done.</li>
            <li> covergirl never fails me</li>
            <li> Definitely do not use more than 2 coats or your eyelashes</li>
            <li> This is this first cover girl mascara</li>
            <li> I have used several top brands and they were more than double the price of this</li>
            <li> Will absolutely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I  received the this product complimentary from Influenster, and I tried it for seven whole days to test it out.</li>
            <li> It never clumps and it makes my eyelashes look so much longer!</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> and I am glad to say I finally found it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE COVERGIRL mascaras and wear it daily.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this mascara and will definitely continue to recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried this product out for seven days straight, even forgot to remove it one night, with no issues!</li>
            <li> It holds a curl pretty well too.</li>
            <li> My eyes looked bigger for sure</li>
            <li> I will totally be buying this every time I need more mascara.</li>
            <li> Overall I love this product and will surely be buying in the future.</li>
            <li> I received the CoverGirl Full Lush Bloom Mascara complimentary from Influenster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took part in the 7-day challenge to see how much Lash Bloom Mascara grew on me and to see how it enhanced my look over time!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it, really!</li>
            <li> When there&#x27;s too much product on the wand, that&#x27;s when you get clumps!</li>
            <li> Once I applied it to my freshly curled lashes they immediately went straight.</li>
            <li> first application of the mascara</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are also very short, so I feel like they aren&#x27;t able to get into my lashes to provide volume, even if the formula could.</li>
            <li> The best part is it&#x27;s not overly expensive.</li>
            <li> Once this one runs out, I&#x27;m definitely willing to buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty mascara in both packaging and the wear.  </li>
            <li> and I really really like using this mascara!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product and I plan to purchase more once my current bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> I personally like to look like I have more than three eye lashes, and this helps me do that.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;d argue its better than many of the more expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It provides length, volume, and curl to my straight lashes!</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product as a good everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time I immediately loved the results, it did not leave my lashes stiff that they hurt to move them but made them stay in place.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned that this mascara is perfect for a natural, effortless looking eyelash look, and they&#x27;re entirely correct.  </li>
            <li> I wore it throughout the whole work day without any flaking or smudging, and at the end of the day it melted right off with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I wore it throughout the whole work day without any flaking or smudging, and at the end of the day it melted right off with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Seeing as mascara is the one product that I absolutely must wear daily, I was quite excited to be able to try this as a brand new product.</li>
            <li> I have found that it&#x27;s a great everyday mascara for natural makeup</li>
            <li> I have found that it&#x27;s a great everyday mascara for natural makeup</li>
            <li> The brush is different than others I&#x27;ve tried, in that it&#x27;s more flexible and rubbery, which I really like.  </li>
            <li> I received this mascara from my influenster box and although I love that it leaves your lashes soft and natural looking</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anybody who wants their lashes to look good everyday.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be sent the COVERGIRL Full LashBlast Mascara by Influenster.</li>
            <li> soft full lashes.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Normally I can layer nonwaterproof formulas over a waterproof one with success, but this one would uncurl my lashes even over a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good everyday mascara!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, my lashes were soft.</li>
            <li> It does have a dry formula which isn&#x27;t pleasing to everyone, but I personally love it.</li>
            <li> , the one downside is that the longer I use it the more dry the formula becomes.  </li>
            <li> Its very build able &amp; super black on the lashes too.</li>
            <li> I recently received COVERGIRL&#x27;s Full LashBloom by LashBlast Mascara complimentary for testing purposes through Influenster.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh...let me just say that after a week of using it, I went ahead and bought a few more for myself, my sisters, and my mom!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from influenster and WOW!</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a great mascara that won&#x27;t flake off and leave you eyes looking black.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I always try every single new version of the Lash Blast mascara, because the original is my favorite mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried (I like it even more than the more expensive, designer brands I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li> Pretty good, not exceptional.</li>
            <li> I also loved how my lashes felt soft and not hard as if I used other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Very little if any clumping and very light weight!</li>
            <li> i would really keep on buying this product again</li>
            <li> I really was unsure about it when I was reading the description that came with it in my Influenster box which I received to review it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put five stars in the review because rvrn though I really like this mascara</li>
            <li> and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> What I realized worked to not make my lashes clump so much, is to sort of blink onto the brush, which really brushes them out and makes them branch out.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> so I tend to be really picky about what I wear.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Personally I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> My lashes look very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; with this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t clump together and it feels weightless.</li>
            <li> I have been searching and searching for a drugstore mascara that I really like</li>
            <li> The tube is a cute pink color, which doesn&#x27;t affect the performance</li>
            <li> This is gentle and not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You have to get really close to your eye.</li>
            <li> Thanks @Influenster</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and didn&#x27;t flake off too much.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very picky about the ones I like</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, it makes my eyelashes look so much longer</li>
            <li> I think Covergirl should have their whole &amp;#34;Lash&amp;#34; line of mascaras infused with the beewax that&#x27;s in this mascara.</li>
            <li> It is not waterproof, but does not smudge much.</li>
            <li> I put two coats on and it stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li> It is softer and don&#x27;t clump as much.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive this mascara from Influenster to try out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very buildable mascara that provides a lot of length and definition.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara and could see myself purchasing it in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this mascara since it coats the whole lash very well.</li>
            <li> I received one to try from Influenster and it&#x27;s worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> I really like how the mascara fans out my lashes and separates them.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to mascara.</li>
            <li> and I really do like it.</li>
            <li> It really lengthens your lashes and the color</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the price</li>
            <li> This mascara was given to me free from Influenster, and I am a total mascara junkie.</li>
            <li> and I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would try my trick of applying waterproof first, then applying a coat of a non waterproof mascara, but I did not.</li>
            <li> Thanks anyway, Influenster.</li>
            <li> As you can see from my before and after picture my lashes are much fuller and this is just one coat of mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple uses, I started to really like the mascara.</li>
            <li> My lashes did not clump, and I gained so much volume.</li>
            <li> but  it really gets the products in the root of my lash.</li>
            <li> It does not give me any fall out which I appreciate so much.</li>
            <li> and just want my lashes to look like real lashes</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> It lengthens my lashes really well and doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have spider legs on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> I will give this 5 stars because it really does everything it promises.</li>
            <li> Overall, I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> and it really did lengthen my lashes with just once coat.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use mascara</li>
            <li> It was really blah for me.</li>
            <li> so it is really reliable.</li>
            <li> with that in mind, i think this would be great on false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> mascara by benefit, but it is a good everyday natural mascara.</li>
            <li> I love trying out new ones and have tried a variety of different brands, from drug store to high end.</li>
            <li> Great mascara for a subtle natural look!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long and comes off easy with makeup wipes.</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t super wet and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall if you have long lashes, this mascara is great to add extra volume and length.</li>
            <li> It is still a bit stuff, but much better than other brands.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy over time like so many other mascaras.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wore it everyday for a week and love how full and natural</li>
            <li> Your lashes will feel super soft and natural like there&#x27;s nothing even on it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and leaves lashes soft and full, and there&#x27;s little to no clumping!</li>
            <li> The brush is great too- not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> I have long straight light lashes.</li>
            <li> I found that even though I really had to apply quite a bit of the product, the brush worked wonders in terms of keeping my lashes separated, so that I could see the full effect of the formula in terms of the aforementioned length and volume.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super dramatic which makes it a perfect daily mascara and appropriate for work.  </li>
            <li> Before recieveing this product, I thought all mascara was the same, but this type is excellant because of the special shape of the bristles.</li>
            <li> It also comes off very easily with makeup remover wipes without leaving black all around my eyes!</li>
            <li> It is very natural and light but guys me the big lashes that I want!</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this as long as it is available from Cover Girl.</li>
            <li> I was sent this mascara by Influenster for free to use for a week, but I&#x27;m still using it long beyond that.  </li>
            <li> The brush separates your lashes but having to apply so many coats to get any difference in volume is not worth the effort or time.</li>
            <li> I add several layers to my lashes to make them full.</li>
            <li> It gives you a smooth and natural look, so I definitely recommend this product and really hope that someday soon they will stop testing on animals</li>
            <li> It does flake of pretty easily though and leaves black marks on my cheeks, so I have to look in myself in the mirror every so often.</li>
            <li> even if you layer on the product, but what you will see is a fair amount of volume and length with a decent amount of pigmentation so that the final look is pretty but not overdone, and your lashes will still feel soft and not even a little &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live this product!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found a new go-to!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually very hesitant to try new mascaras just because once I find one that works for me, I&#x27;d like to stick with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a decent mascara for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a decent mascara by Covergirl.</li>
            <li> Clever thinking by developers.</li>
            <li> But this is still a decent mascara</li>
            <li> It gave a decent amount of volume, and did not appear to clump while I was applying it.</li>
            <li> I only drop it to four stars because it is not paraben free or natural.</li>
            <li> So, for everyone looking for a decent mascara, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d regret giving this one a try.</li>
            <li> I like this particular product mainly because of the petal-shaped brush.</li>
            <li> It really meets it&#x27;s goal at making your eyelashes soft and just makes them Bloom!</li>
            <li> I was sent this mascara to try by Influenster, and I did not have high hopes.</li>
            <li> The application process was very smooth, I often have trouble with my eyelashes clumping with this mascara</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is definitely a high quality mascara for the price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love the color and how it doesn&#x27;t make them too wild looking unlike some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have used other CoverGirl products before and this mascara so far is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Pretty Long Lasting and easy to take off at the end of the day with a make up</li>
            <li> They also do leave your lashes soft to the touch unlike many other mascaras I have used.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over a week and am in love.</li>
            <li> While I do like the length that this mascara gave to my lashes, I still felt that it clumped up a little more than I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> I received this product from Influenster.com a little over a week ago, and I love it.</li>
            <li> At first I was sketchy because of the rather large brush and tube but it has not only made them look longer</li>
            <li> It is easy to take off with one wipe, as opposed to the two wipes I normally use to take off other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I am usually pretty picky about mascara because I have long lashes and its hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t clump and looks good.</li>
            <li> if your like that whole natural look</li>
            <li> The mascara, is soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t really like it on my natural eyelashes,</li>
            <li> This makes my eyelashes look long and full.</li>
            <li> For a drug store buy, I&#x27;d recommend for people with normal length/ thickness lashes.  </li>
            <li> Most mascaras that give you length also clump of look too heavy.</li>
            <li> This is definitely something worth trying.</li>
            <li> My lashes appeared way longer than normal and well defined.</li>
            <li> All in all I really like this mascara, I definitely would recommend it if you are someone like me that has sparse eyelashes and just want to make them look a little better without getting to dramatic (or if you already have great eyelashes</li>
            <li> My lashes are not clumped together and they are not hard at all.</li>
            <li> It thickens and separates your lashes a bit better than plain Lashblast.</li>
            <li> My lashes are naturally super long</li>
            <li> I have used it for a week now and unfortunately other than it veing free, i wouldnt recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> You can check out my blog http://christinasharnelle.blogspot.com/ to see how I got to try this product and other products for free from influenster.</li>
            <li> So I got this new product in the</li>
            <li> so I am always looking for new mascaras to make them longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I was in need of new mascara and was unsure what to buy when my GoBloom VoxBox arrived.</li>
            <li> and I can say that it is new \\&quot;go to\\&quot; mascara.</li>
            <li> have pretty long lashes already, so it isn&#x27;t a problem to me that this mascara doesn&#x27;t do much for lengthening or volumizing.</li>
            <li> Typically my mascara loses its effect by mid afternoon, but this one looked impressive until I got home around 7pm.</li>
            <li> have pretty long lashes already, so it isn&#x27;t a problem to me that this mascara doesn&#x27;t do much for lengthening or volumizing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised at the length it gives my lashes and it goes on nice and thick, hugging all my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have been a longtime fan of the LashBlast macaras, but this one has an even better formula that I can use right away instead of waiting for it to dry out a little to its optimal texture.</li>
            <li> and it has cute little flowers on it!</li>
            <li> I have very blonde lashes and this makes them look long thick and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> This is a very natural looking mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, and doesn&#x27;t clump or  make my lashes feel still.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural looking mascara</li>
            <li> This Full Lash Bloom mascara does what other high costing mascaras do for about 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> It is so lightweight and makes my lashes feel so soft!</li>
            <li> There is no clumping and it is so natural looking!</li>
            <li> I have completed the 7-day challenge and have seen personally how much Lash Bloom Mascara has enhanced my look!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, either!</li>
            <li> I have always been a bit put off with the small bristles of most mascaras</li>
            <li> but I was surprisingly surprised that my eye lashes did not clump!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot so far!</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described by Covergirl - a softer mascara that does not short you on volume or length.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look normal and soft.</li>
            <li> so it clumps somewhat, but it really gives my barely there</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d like a more dramatic coat, just apply more coats rather than a single layer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake over the course of a day, it&#x27;s a great dark black for just enough drama!</li>
            <li> the hot pink color really makes it stand out</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster to review, and I opened the package without a single expectation.</li>
            <li> Recently something changed with the formula and my beloved mascara became unusable due to extreme clumping.</li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s not a perfect product, but with multiple coats, the resulting lash look is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I like a very volumizing mascara, as I have very long lashes and don&#x27;t need much length.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product, but was let down by the quality.</li>
            <li> I have learned that if I use several coats of mascara then it&#x27;ll help lengthen the lashes a little more.</li>
            <li> The problem I have with most mascaras is that they leave my eye lashes clumpy and they&#x27;re hard to take off.</li>
            <li> It worked well and looked natural when I just used one coat of it, but when I tried it with the second coat they ended up looking very clumpy.</li>
            <li> Overall it gives a great look, but application and removal is difficult.</li>
            <li> As far as getting it off goes, I had to resort to vaseline -- NOT</li>
            <li> It is not heavy</li>
            <li> It gave my lashes a natural look</li>
            <li> but it will bend like natural lashes.</li>
            <li> It make them look longer darker while looking natural.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li> It is weightless and that&#x27;s the way I enjoy my makeup while I am on the go everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl who loves soft, natural looking lashes and this mascara</li>
            <li> like how, like it says your eyelashes stay soft after application.</li>
            <li> for those days where I just wanted a soft natural look this was my go to mascara.</li>
            <li> In this product leaves them soft and clump-free.</li>
            <li> My lashes remained soft, and I did not experience any flaking.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been having many issues with my eyes lately</li>
            <li> It gives you voluminous, soft lashes and a bit of curve.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every drugstore brand mascara on the market</li>
            <li> No complaints so far</li>
            <li> With Lash Bloom, my lashes still feel soft and malleable to the touch.</li>
            <li> It gives me soft, natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse short eyelashes</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it for 7 days</li>
            <li> it is natural looking no mascara chunks or caking&lt;</li>
            <li> I recommend it for people looking for a natural look.</li>
            <li> It does leave you lash soft.</li>
            <li> It gives you a natural, no clumpy look.</li>
            <li> This mascara gives my lashes a really natural look without the clumping.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight Asian lashes and I knew once I saw that it was not waterproof it would not work.</li>
            <li> In order to really amp up the look, and see noticeable lengthening, volumizing, and pigmentation, you&#x27;ll likely need to use 3 coats.  </li>
            <li> , I have extremely sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> The packaging does not lie when it says it will leave your lashes soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> and it last the whole day through all my classes.</li>
            <li> It was extremely natural, and didn&#x27;t clump at all.</li>
            <li> My lashes felt soft to the touch abd didn&#x27;t clump together.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and no irritation.</li>
            <li> looks natural.</li>
            <li> but I guess my eyes are just too sensitive for it.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 18 year old, she used it once and threw it out.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for natural looking mascara, this is a mascara for you.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long eye lashes, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned about the length.</li>
            <li> I didnt want to put it near my eye balls.</li>
            <li> It gives your lashes a natural lift exposing and beautifying your eye.</li>
            <li> I think I lost a few too many of my eyelashes during the several weeks</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes full and dark, with quite a bit of length.</li>
            <li> Id definitely say its more of an everyday mascara for me, but its like my go to mascara when im in a hurry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time devotee of a name-brand, expensive mascara that I loved because I didn&#x27;t need to curl my lashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay mascara, but it&#x27;s not amazing.</li>
            <li> This mascara seemed very dry right from the start.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, normally I always have a dark Smokey eye, with dark eyeliner, eye shadow, and the one product I can&#x27;t live without mascara.</li>
            <li> As the package suggests, it did make your lashes very soft, however, I am not sure that this is a huge issue that warrants</li>
            <li> Very Black free from Influenster for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> Very Black free from Influenster for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> Very Black free from Influenster for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in very black from influenster free to try and review.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from Influenster in the shade Very Black.</li>
            <li> I really am just not giving this mascara a full 5 star review because it is not waterproof and unfortunately their brand still tests on animals which is something that I don&#x27;t give my support to, but I received a complimentary sample from Influenster to try, so</li>
            <li> Other than that totally worth a try for price</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look really full and long, but not too long.</li>
            <li> This color is very black but really doesn&#x27;t feel like that is more like black.</li>
            <li> It is not flaky or dry and gives you full yet long lashes.</li>
            <li> and I have been using this the past 4 days ( huge shocker for me).</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes so it didn&#x27;t really make a difference to me.</li>
            <li> Not necessarily meaning you have to put on a lot of coats, just that it&#x27;s not thick and clumpy looking or feeling.</li>
            <li> I actually like because I normally use maybelline</li>
            <li> Very minimal volume, this is NOT a dramatic mascara!</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to mascara, and I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new mascara.</li>
            <li> Generally I purchase higher name brand like Dior, Tarte, etc.. and never really considered Covergirl.</li>
            <li> It is not flaky or dry and really spreads out the lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always envied the ones with long lashes and have tried several products promising to help with lash growth or even mascaras promising those long lush looking lashes with just one application.</li>
            <li> Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use this on a daily basis, just because it doesn&#x27;t volumize my lashes as much as I wish it did.</li>
            <li> I use multiple coats for color and length, and it does really well without getting clumpy or gross.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as their professional series, which is my current favorite.</li>
            <li> Lasted all day and left my lashes soft !</li>
            <li> More for a natural look rather than a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> The color is dark but it still comes off natural looking, and it didn&#x27;t clump too much (but it did once or twice).  </li>
            <li> It actually was soft and didn&#x27;t flake off like some mascaras do.</li>
            <li> You can barely tell that the mascara is on.</li>
            <li> It gives a natural look to your lashes, it doesn&#x27;t give extra volume, yet it gives enough to lift your lashes and make it look as glamorous as it should naturally.</li>
            <li> I love this product I got it about a month ago from the Influenster Team and my eye lashes look so thick and long.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for any woman who wears mascara all the time and wants it to look natural with no flaking or wearing down.</li>
            <li> I get asked almost every day if I have fake lashes because they look so full, long, and pretty!!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this for the busy college student who wants to add a little pop to her every day makeup routine or the busy working woman!</li>
            <li> When you put it on your lashes are soft and have volume without all the flaking and smudging that you normally get from other mascaras.</li>
            <li> The beeswax makes them feel much softer than other mascaras, too.</li>
            <li> I was excited, to say the least.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes feeling hard and gross like a lot of mascaras do.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried to figure out what the issue was, either the dry weather or the new mascara.</li>
            <li> I like a more dramatic look to my lashes but</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get as much volume as I would like, but honestly no mascara really gives me the volume I want.</li>
            <li> For the very FIRST time I got NO FLAKING, which is what would make me buy this mascara again in the future, since all the other mascaras that I tried end up clumping after they dry.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it&#x27;s kind of difficult to remove, even with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> I had a major problem with clumping every time I wore this mascara, and that is the sole reason this gets 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I love that it does not make my lashes feel hard or smudge throughout the day like other mascaras I have used.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very nice for casual everyday use.</li>
            <li> It goes on great, separates each lash and gives it crazy volume!</li>
            <li> I also do not think it gives much length especially compared to other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I also do not think it gives much length especially compared to other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Other mascaras have left my lashes very crunchy and sometimes cause them to fall out.</li>
            <li> the black from the mascara really made my lashes pop.</li>
            <li> Seemed to be a bit old because it&#x27;s a bit dry when applying.</li>
            <li> After several hours, it started falling off and my eyelashes went back to looking bare.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply because of the thin and correct consistency.</li>
            <li> first application I thought this was just an ordinary mascara and wasn&#x27;t really any different than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Normally, that would be a recipe for disaster, as so many other mascaras clump, giving us those unsightly and uncomfortable &amp;#34;spider&amp;#34; lashes.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave black marks around your eyes when you look down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great day mascara; something to use when you want length but don&#x27;t want CRAZY dark or long lashes like you&#x27;d maybe want for a night out.</li>
            <li> My lashes look thick, full and long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth the small investment!</li>
            <li> One coat of this product will only slightly darken and lengthen your lashes, while leaving them very soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It adds natural looking volume and does not apply \\&quot;clumpy\\&quot; like other mascaras.</li>
            <li> The first few times it looked like I had nothing on my lashes but within days it was clumpy on the brush and left clumps on my lashes unless I was extremely careful.</li>
            <li> I live in Chicago so the snow against my face would melt the black onto my eye lids.</li>
            <li> I think I naturally have long lashes that this didnt do what i expected it to do.</li>
            <li> I usually use Two-Faced Better Than Sex Mascara, which goes on thick and creates a lot of drama.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes super long and thick looking, but still feels soft and natural instead of hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> This mascara is definitely drugstore-quality, and I do like using it on my bottom lashes for a subtle look, but it&#x27;s just not dramatic enough for my upper lashes.</li>
            <li> Now, I have vey sensitive eyes; so probably the burning would not happen to an average person.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear mascara because my lashes are very stubborn and do not curl.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if because of the fact that I don&#x27;t normally wear make up several times a day or because the product really improves your look (probably a little bit of both!).</li>
            <li> I have been using the very black 800 and it is true to its name: very black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very wet mascara to start off with, so for me it just makes applying it a bit harder.</li>
            <li> Doesnt clump and last all day long without running!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to everyone who loves long and separated lashes!</li>
            <li> If this mascara was made waterproof it would be my new everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes a natural black color.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this mascara if you are going for a natural simple everyday look.</li>
            <li> With Lash Bloom it is a very soft look and not to heavy or gothic.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I was a little let down because it took me forever to get the product to build up because I like my lashes to be long and separated and BAM in your face.</li>
            <li> The brush teeth were rubbery which is not normally what I use (I&#x27;m a diorshow girl) a Diorshow comparable product this is not even with using the diorshow mascara primer my lashes didn&#x27;t look any different.</li>
            <li> The color does live up to its name being &#x27;very black&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The mascara was a little difficult to remove, and sorta pulled on my lashes, but it was really easy to put on and gave me a full thick lash.</li>
            <li> One thing I hate about mascara is how makes your eyelashes super stiff which then makes it much more susceptible to flaking.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get my bottom lashes without smearing mascara but not completely impossible.</li>
            <li> After using for a while I noticed it does feel soft and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> It made them really long and separated which Is what I look in a mascara.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes; however, they lack fullness/volume.</li>
            <li> I noticed in the past few weeks, I was starting to develop eczema under my eyes, and my eyes were very puffy and red.</li>
            <li> After my lashes dried, they were soft to the touch and felt like I had never put any mascara on.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long eye lashes</li>
            <li> It did create a long wispy?</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time but comes off with ease.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced any issues with makeup or mascara, and have used Covergirl mascara many times in the past.</li>
            <li> I will definitely try out the waterproof version, cause unless it&#x27;s waterproof, American brand mascara are not strong enough to hold my curls.</li>
            <li> the package says, its not very &#x27;wet&amp;#34; and it won&#x27;t make your lashes hard or super black.</li>
            <li> No more clumps and my lashes feel so soft!</li>
            <li> It was almost completely dry when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I think that I would have had softer lashes if I dipped them in tar and let it dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and it doesn&#x27;t get all dry and clumpy on my lashes either.</li>
            <li> It is a bit dry</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not too much and the formula isn&#x27;t wet or thick.</li>
            <li> The little amount that I could get on was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> , it goes on pretty thin.</li>
            <li> I feel like it gives me the same big lashes as my previous mascara and flakes even less.</li>
            <li> My lashes were thick and dark, but very clumped.</li>
            <li> I can not live with out it!</li>
            <li> have a large collection of different mascaras due to the fact that my eye lashes are very thin and short-</li>
            <li> I would definitely reccommend this mascara for anyone looking for a mess</li>
            <li> I would definitely use it as more of a day mascara because it is not as dramatic as others, very subtle.</li>
            <li> I have LONG lashes now!!!</li>
            <li> I have not tried the waterproof version, but even without sweating or my eyes watering, it was a bad situation most days.</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes look so dark and long.</li>
            <li> how it was girly looking with the pink case with flowers.</li>
            <li> then just be careful on the lower lashes, as mine tended to get wet and end up in the corners of my eyes after a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> However, the mascara does not lengthen as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it tended to flake a bit after a few hours of wearing it and I would find it on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> therefore leaving me with not much volume at all.</li>
            <li> This mascara isn&#x27;t rough on them at all.</li>
            <li> (I expected it to be softer)</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with what mascaras I use.</li>
            <li> But with any mascara, my thick, short, stubborn Asian lashes are no match to a non-waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new mascara over the past few months</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t harsh like other mascaras, though it is still present.</li>
            <li> Never clumps but did seem to dry out a little faster than expected.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sick of the flaking like I am, then this is definitely the right mascara for you!</li>
            <li> Ido have to note that even with those small globs, this wasn&#x27;t at all a messy mascara to apply: usually, I wind up with some on my eyelids (much to my frustration) regardless of how carefully I apply whatever mascara I&#x27;m using at the time, but I didn&#x27;t have that issue at all with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look into other cover girl products</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I would buy this any day over any other mascara.</li>
            <li> and this gives equal if not better results.</li>
            <li> After a week of use I am extremely satistfied.</li>
            <li> and I notice that it didn&#x27;t make my lashes look or feel crunchy like my other mascara does.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I had a small problem with was that by the end of the day it seemed as if I didn&#x27;t have any of it left on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any clumping issues and it doesn&#x27;t just flake off like a lot of other mascaras.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump and it gives my eyelashes the volume and length that I want without all of the extra mascara that usually makes my eyes irritated.</li>
            <li> And it separates the lashes extremely well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very long eyelashes, so I need a product that makes them look longer and isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> It also did not flake off throughout the day or dry up and look limp.</li>
            <li> I could take two showers and use eye makeup remover multiple times, and the mascara application from three days prior would still be gummed onto my poor lashes.</li>
            <li> It says that it doesn&#x27;t dry hard which in my head meant that it might be tacky or sticky and that it didn&#x27;t really dry.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t curl my lashes and rather weighed it down.</li>
            <li> Hands down, fave mascara.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes like other brands that I have used!</li>
            <li> The Very Black color is as expected.  </li>
            <li> a dark black</li>
            <li> It did not make my lashes feel weighed down and heavy like other products that I have used.</li>
            <li> The one I tried was not waterproof, so If you have a very wet lashline (I do, I can&#x27;t wear ANY pencil eyeliners on my lower lids because of this!)</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using it since I am not a fan of crunchy lashes and this works for a subtle look</li>
            <li> The smell is typical mascara smell.</li>
            <li> The mascara provides lots of volume with just two coats, but the definition that comes with it is less than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> ; I would say if you use less than two coats you would achieve that.</li>
            <li> i dont get those black circles in the mroning from stubborn mascara that never comes off.</li>
            <li> This goes on in less than a minute</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week and a half now</li>
            <li> will be choosing this over my previous mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> will look like a mess.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes pop without all the flaking, clumping mess.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show up real dark like other mascaras I have used.</li>
            <li> This mascara lasted on me for hours till I saw a little smudging on the sides of my eyes.</li>
            <li> it did smudge a little at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have used some CoverGirl products in the past, but do prefer other brands.</li>
            <li> There is also little to no volume, as it claims to give.</li>
            <li> It makes for a messy application, or a mess of trying to get the globs off.</li>
            <li> The mascara irritates my eyes a little.</li>
            <li> Nothing a little water couldn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> I do like the product a lot, as it stands out against typically plain black tubes.</li>
            <li> though very dark just like i like.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a bad tube, but I feel like it&#x27;s a very dry formula that doesn&#x27;t really adhere well to my lashes -</li>
            <li> But it  become tacky when it dried.</li>
            <li> I recieved this from influenster a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a week, and after a few hours it would start to run.</li>
            <li> I wore it everyday for 7 days to see how it enhanced my look.</li>
            <li> It was a bit messy and clumpy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few mascaras</li>
            <li> A few coats and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> The formula doesn&#x27;t clump and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one of those who likes cakey dried lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I also like that the packaging allows for you to grip the wand without any trouble.</li>
            <li> I use it for everyday use</li>
            <li> only false lashes...</li>
            <li> This formula is not super thick which does not weigh down my lashes.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve tried to get past the fact that it was gloppy thinking in time it would be less like that</li>
            <li> But it surpassed any previous expectations I had!</li>
            <li> It does not leave the hard, crunchy feeling on my lashes like other mascaras i have used before.</li>
            <li> It does not leave the hard, crunchy feeling on my lashes like some other mascaras.</li>
            <li> It does not leave the hard, crunchy feeling on my lashes like some other mascaras.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your lashes stiff and brittle all day.</li>
            <li> The wand itself is a bit stiff</li>
            <li> Terribly stiff wand bristles.</li>
            <li> Very Black (800) defines your lashes , almost falsie like.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure of it, it pulled at my eyelashes and I am not sure what caused that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the past few years I&#x27;ve used their waterproof lash blast mascara exclusively.</li>
            <li> So, I do not fully know if this caused my issue, but it has been bad enough that I am hesitating going back to this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as black and thick as I&#x27;d hope for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past week.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s none of the crunchy dryness that usually occurs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it took me 3 coats to get a fuller look which is what I usually go</li>
            <li> No more spider lashes, no more stickiness...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it for the past 4 days.</li>
            <li> For the past week I have used this mascara I have noticed it seperated my lashes and added lift</li>
            <li> Usually with a mascara</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied with the brush at all.</li>
            <li> I tried this mascara every day for the past week.</li>
            <li> I even prefer this to the green Lash Blast!</li>
            <li> Additionally, I noticed that as I would remove the wand from the tube, there would be some small globs of product stuck to the bristles;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mean seriously its pink!</li>
            <li> I have very short blonde eyelashes, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a mascara that will add definition to my lashes without clumping (I hate clumping).</li>
            <li> and I never experienced any flaky, spikey and hard lashes that other mascaras tend to cause.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on thick or leave your eyelashes feeling heavy!</li>
            <li> Very stiff and spiky</li>
            <li> and it lengthens and volumizes without smudging or causing your lashes to become hard after drying.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cake on to your lashes no matter how hard you try to cake it on.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no clumping and my lashes don&#x27;t get hard to the touch like they do with the lash blast.</li>
            <li> At least.  </li>
            <li> It lengthens well, the formula isn&#x27;t too thick, or too watery.</li>
            <li> i say that because it would make reusing and cleaning them easier, it isn&#x27;t a thick formula to remove either</li>
            <li> if you know what i mean.</li>
            <li> I honestly hate trying new mascara because I&#x27;m always worried about clumping.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that it is impossible to get it off, and it burned my eyes.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for some serious volume, this alone will not do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent crazy money on designer mascara and they all clump and make me look like I have 3 eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because it smears so much that it is unusable.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was a bit annoying for me was the non water proof-ness of it.</li>
            <li> Wearing it I almost feel like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was nervous that it wasn&#x27;t waterproof, because that&#x27;s my preferred type of mascara due to oily skin and a bad habit of wiping at my eyes.</li>
            <li> , the formula makes my lashes heavy and they feel very fake.</li>
            <li> Does not make lashes feel especially stiff.  </li>
            <li> and this is by far one of the worst.</li>
            <li> Boy have i been missing out!!!!</li>
            <li> ((This formula isn&#x27;t waterproof, so don&#x27;t wear this out to see a sad movie or anything.))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED.</li>
            <li> I am so obsessed with it</li>
            <li> , I was unable to wash off my makeup</li>
            <li> and you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> i guess i would just use it on my expensive falsies, that way they don&#x27;t get ruined or anything of that sort.</li>
            <li> I found the wand of the mascara difficult to manuever</li>
            <li> ((This formula isn&#x27;t waterproof, so don&#x27;t wear this out to see a sad movie or anything.))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not work with my lashes.</li>
            <li> I no longer was experiencing that weird pull.</li>
            <li> Some of the things I was afraid would happen</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> After 7 days of wearing this mascara, I have decided that it is not too bad.</li>
            <li> Every product has disappointed me until now.</li>
            <li> but i was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Haha...had a difficult time putting it on then!!</li>
            <li> I hate those bulky applicators.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really bad flakes with mascara, but I haven&#x27;t had any with the Bloom mascara!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard for me to find a mascara that works and doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes together, well this is awesome, it works very good.  I don&#x27;t have to keep applying it throughout the day I apply once and that&#x27;s it.  This makes my eyelashes look long and full. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Unlike everyone else who posted a review, I actually bought this product with MY OWN MONEY and did not receive it from Influencer; whatever that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent mascara for the money. It thickens and separates your lashes a bit better than plain Lashblast. My only concern is that it is impossible to get it off, and it burned my eyes. Now, I have vey sensitive eyes; so probably the burning would not happen to an average person. As far as getting it off goes, I had to resort to vaseline -- NOT fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an OK mascara for people with normal eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my current fave mascara! Makes your lashes look so dark and long. Two coats is what I use, and I have no problem with clumps. The brush is great too- not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara as a complimentary gift from Influenster for testing purposes. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried cover girls mascara and I can say I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the quality! It will now be my go to mascara.. I&#x27;m going to look into other cover girl products</li>
            <li> I have been using the CoverGirl full lash bloom mascara for seven days as a beauty challenge and it is wonderful. It is not heavy i can use it for day and night; it does not flake and it makes your lashes look fuller and longer. I would definitely reccommend this mascara for anyone looking for a mess free fabulous mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product complimentary from Influenter for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I thankfully got a free package of this mascara from influenster to test and although most mascaras cause my eyelash line to hurt this one is very gentile while still giving a full look.</li>
            <li> I received this from Influenster, for free. When I saw that it was being sent, I was so excited because I had planned on buying this item anyway. I always try every single new version of the Lash Blast mascara, because the original is my favorite mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried (I like it even more than the more expensive, designer brands I&#x27;ve tried). Now, that being said, this mascara is amazing! One thing I hate about mascara is how makes your eyelashes super stiff which then makes it much more susceptible to flaking. I&#x27;ve had this product for a week (and have used it every day) and haven&#x27;t experienced any of those problems. If you&#x27;re sick of the flaking like I am, then this is definitely the right mascara for you!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing. I love it, it doesn&#x27;t flake off and it lasts all day! It also comes off very easily with makeup remover wipes without leaving black all around my eyes!</li>
            <li> Received this mascara complimentary from Influenster-- all opnions are my own: Loving this mascara! It has amazing staying power, is easy to use, and gives beautifully full lashes!</li>
            <li> I got this full lash bloom mascara complimentary of Influenster &amp; love it! It doesn&#x27;t clump &amp; maximizes the volume of my lashes for an easy daytime look!</li>
            <li> I got this product as an #influenter gift and I love it. I usually don&#x27;t care for these type of mascara brubrushes but this one makes my eyelashes look great!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  I definitely liked it!  I&#x27;ve used it for the past week.  The brush is different than others I&#x27;ve tried, in that it&#x27;s more flexible and rubbery, which I really like.  It made application easy.  The color is dark but it still comes off natural looking, and it didn&#x27;t clump too much (but it did once or twice).  Overall it&#x27;s definitely a solid product.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in length or anything by the end of the week, but it&#x27;s still good mascara at a decent price.</li>
            <li>  I received this mascara in the shade Very Black free from Influenster for product testing and review. I enjoy it! It does not leave the hard, crunchy feeling on my lashes like other mascaras i have used before. I also like the product presentation the hot pink color really makes it stand out i would really keep on buying this product again</li>
            <li> *I received the product complimentary from Influenster*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually saw this in the stores and have been meaning to try it out. But with any mascara, my thick, short, stubborn Asian lashes are no match to a non-waterproof mascara. So as soon as I got this in the mail, I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still tried it out and I&#x27;m surprised at the length it gives my lashes and it goes on nice and thick, hugging all my lashes. I will definitely try out the waterproof version, cause unless it&#x27;s waterproof, American brand mascara are not strong enough to hold my curls.</li>
            <li> I got this product complimentary of influenster. Although this wasn&#x27;t waterproof for me, I did love how it gave my lashes length and made it more prominent. It gave my lashes a natural look and I&#x27;m all for natural-ness. This mascara lasted on me for hours till I saw a little smudging on the sides of my eyes. I also loved how my lashes felt soft and not hard as if I used other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product a 4 star because I cannot stand non-waterproof mascaras, especially in the summer time. But, other than that, I loved the volume and length it gavee me. I usually put on two coats for the first week after receiving this from Influenster and it somewhat made my lashes look like falsies..Which I adore mascaras that do that. I definitely recommend this product!  Love the mascara and the price! Will be buying now that it is winter :)</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in a voxbox from influenster. I have used it for around a week now and I absolutely love it. I would recommend 2 coats for the full effect. Other than that totally worth a try for price</li>
            <li> I did the 7 day challenge with my cover girl bloom mascara  I revived complimentary from @influenster &amp; I absolutely loved it!!! Every girl should definitely have this mascara!</li>
            <li> I really was unsure about it when I was reading the description that came with it in my Influenster box which I received to review it. It says that it doesn&#x27;t dry hard which in my head meant that it might be tacky or sticky and that it didn&#x27;t really dry. But it  become tacky when it dried. It actually was soft and didn&#x27;t flake off like some mascaras do. You can touch it and it doesn&#x27;t come off on your finger but it will bend like natural lashes. I didn&#x27;t put five stars in the review because rvrn though I really like this mascara it did smudge a little at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Perfect for any occasion! Doesnt clump and last all day long without running!</li>
            <li> I received a full size of this product from Influenster for testing purposes and took the 7 day challenge! I loved how my lashes felt day after day. It keeps my lashes soft and doesn&#x27;t clump which I love! They look longer and fuller without the discomfort of regular mascaras.</li>
            <li> I got free from Influenster.com. I have been using it for 2 weeks and I love it. It is light and adds length to my lashes and is not clumpy. It make them look longer darker while looking natural.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this mascara about a week back after receiving a complementary full-size for review purposes (from Influenster).&lt;br /&gt;It is an alright mascara. It held up to the claims of not being smudgy or clumpy, but I did notice some flaking as time went on. I have used some CoverGirl products in the past, but do prefer other brands. This mascara was great at defining lashes and lasted at least 8hrs or so before becoming a bit flaky for me.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster and I was skeptical at first. I&#x27;ve been a long-time devotee of a name-brand, expensive mascara that I loved because I didn&#x27;t need to curl my lashes and it didn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes. I really can&#x27;t remember the last time I bought drug store mascara because I loved it so much. BUT I tried Lash Bloom every day for about 2 weeks and I really like it a lot. I feel like it gives me the same big lashes as my previous mascara and flakes even less. The beeswax makes them feel much softer than other mascaras, too. Love!</li>
            <li> I will admit right off the bat that I am spoiled to my lash extensions, and that this is the first mascara I have used in almost 3 years. However, when my extensions came off in January I couldn&#x27;t find time to go have them redone. That&#x27;s where this mascara comes in. I was sent this mascara to try by Influenster, and I did not have high hopes. Some of the things I was afraid would happen did, like clumping. I had a major problem with clumping every time I wore this mascara, and that is the sole reason this gets 3 stars. It lengthens well, the formula isn&#x27;t too thick, or too watery. The clumping is the problem.</li>
            <li> I have used the lash full bloom every day since I bought it! I get asked almost every day if I have fake lashes because they look so full, long, and pretty!! I recommend this product to anyone! It&#x27;s totally worth the small investment! i received the full lash bloom mascara complimentary of Influenster.</li>
            <li> I recieved this from influenster a few weeks ago. I had my reservations but I am completely in love now! The brush is so unique and covers/separates your lashes for a beautiful look!</li>
            <li> This product is by far one of my favorite mascaras, not to mention it&#x27;s adorable!! It&#x27;s super easy to use and rarely clumps. my lashes are a million times longer when i wear it :)</li>
            <li> I recently got this awesome mascara in the mail to test it out for influenster I&#x27;ve tried it for about a week and I&#x27;m in love with how full it makes my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free as a tester via Influenster, and I&#x27;m head over heels! It&#x27;s very light and leaves lashes soft and full, and there&#x27;s little to no clumping! I&#x27;m definitely sold on this and will absolutely buy more when this one runs out!</li>
            <li> I got this mascara as a complimentary gift from Influenster for testing purposes, and I love it so much! It is so lightweight and makes my lashes feel so soft! As a contact wearer, it is crucial that it is suitable and opthalmologically tested!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product compliments of influenster. I have used it for a week now and unfortunately other than it veing free, i wouldnt recommend this mascara. I like my mascara a bit thicker and with the brush that comes with it, it goes on pretty thin. Good black color though very dark just like i like.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I was excited to use this product, but was let down by the quality. Using 2 coats will make it look clumpy. I&#x27;m not a fan of the plastic applicator and I don&#x27;t believe that this mascara gives the best volume that it claims to give. I also do not think it gives much length especially compared to other mascaras. I really liked the packaging and how it was girly looking with the pink case with flowers. I appreciate the opportunity to review these products for free and I always give my honest opinion. I give this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> i recieved this compliments of Influenster. i like it a lot especially since most mascaras make your eyelashes look over done. if you know what i mean. Its good if your like that whole natural look but if not i do not reccommend unless you use like 36 coats. but its still a good product. covergirl never fails me</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary full sized product from Influenster and It is absolutely amazing! The application process was very smooth, I often have trouble with my eyelashes clumping with this mascara I don&#x27;t have that issue. It is very natural and light but guys me the big lashes that I want!</li>
            <li> So I got this new product in the it is Full Lash Bloom by Covergirl. Must say this one of the best mascara I have ever used. It is light weight, goes on very smooth, and last all day. It doesn&#x27;t flake and it look flawless alll day. I got this from influenster. Influenster is great website of you like to review and get others opinions on pretty much anything you can imagine.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from Influenster and I love it. It came in &amp;#34;Very Black&amp;#34; I love how it doesn&#x27;t clump up my eyelashes. It leaves them looking very nice and lengthy. I totally recommend it</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I DID receive this mascara for free as an Influenster campaign, to test and review products. As mascara is probably my go to product, I have tried many mascaras over the years. This was a good one, for its price range! It lasted several hours, without flaking or smudging.  The one I tried was not waterproof, so If you have a very wet lashline (I do, I can&#x27;t wear ANY pencil eyeliners on my lower lids because of this!) then just be careful on the lower lashes, as mine tended to get wet and end up in the corners of my eyes after a couple of hours.  Gave a fair amount of volume, and lengthened a little bit, but as it doesn&#x27;t specialize in either-- I wasn&#x27;t surprised. For a drug store buy, I&#x27;d recommend for people with normal length/ thickness lashes.  If you have fine / short, go for a more specialized formula.</li>
            <li> Best eye make up I&#x27;ve ever used. I love it. I got it from the cover girl vox box for testing purposes. And I loveeeee it. It makes my eye lashes just pop and they don&#x27;t look or get clumpy!!! :)</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing and I love the way it feels on my lashes! It is weightless and that&#x27;s the way I enjoy my makeup while I am on the go everyday. I think that if your going for a bold night look then this is not the mascara for you, however people who enjoy day looks and very modest approaches to makeup are going to love this! I would buy this any day over any other mascara. I was given a sample by influenster and I tried this for a week to guarantee that I loved it as much as I did in the beginning.</li>
            <li> i got this as a part of the influencer program and it wears great without  clumping</li>
            <li> This mascara is one of my new favorite mascara&#x27;s and I am so glad that Influenster sent me a free tube of it to try out! I was and still am thoroughly pleased. It is great for a daily make up routine and it lengthens and volumizes without smudging or causing your lashes to become hard after drying. I highly recommend buying and trying this mascara, I am sure you will love it!!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product from influenster for testing purposes and I absolutely love it! It leaves my lashes so soft and full!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I received this mascara for free as an Influenster campaign, to test and review product.  This is a very natural looking mascara. It does not flake or smudge. I would recommend this mascara if you are going for a natural simple everyday look. The wand reminds me of the Benefit They&#x27;re Real mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not volumizing or lengthening&lt;br /&gt;  Didn&#x27;t hold a curl&lt;br /&gt;This mascara didn&#x27;t provide me with what I was looking for. I like a very volumizing mascara, as I have very long lashes and don&#x27;t need much length. I would not purchase this mascara.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. This is a good mascara to use if you want natural looking lashes, especially using just one coat of the mascara. Using 2 coats will make it look kind of clumpy. Definitely do not use more than 2 coats or your eyelashes will look like a mess. I don&#x27;t believe that this mascara gives the best volume that it claims to give. I also do not think it gives much length especially compared to other mascaras. I think it is good for natural looking lashes though. Good for teens just starting out in mascara. I appreciate the opportunity to review these products for free and I always give my honest opinion. I give this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! And Recommend it</li>
            <li> I got this product as a tester from Influenster. It worked well and looked natural when I just used one coat of it, but when I tried it with the second coat they ended up looking very clumpy. What I realized worked to not make my lashes clump so much, is to sort of blink onto the brush, which really brushes them out and makes them branch out. It is a pretty good mascara if you know how to use it, but it takes a while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in the shade Very Black free from Influenster for product testing and review. I enjoy it! It does not leave the hard, crunchy feeling on my lashes like some other mascaras. I have found that it&#x27;s a great everyday mascara for natural makeup looks. I wore it throughout the whole work day without any flaking or smudging, and at the end of the day it melted right off with makeup remover. ((This formula isn&#x27;t waterproof, so don&#x27;t wear this out to see a sad movie or anything.))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty long lashes already, so it isn&#x27;t a problem to me that this mascara doesn&#x27;t do much for lengthening or volumizing. If it&#x27;s drama you&#x27;re after, you&#x27;ll need to reach for Benefit or Makeup Forever, crunchy though they may be.</li>
            <li> Excellent at lengthening &amp; separating. Best paired with a thickening mascara to achieve fullness and length.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product from Influenster. For the price I do not think that this product is worth purchasing. I tried it for a week, and after a few hours it would start to run. There is also little to no volume, as it claims to give. One coat is perfect for natural looking lashes, but if you want anything more than that then I would say to buy a different mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: Mascara runs, no volume, clumps after more than one coat.&lt;br /&gt;Positives: Safe for contacts, natural looking with one coat</li>
            <li> I received a free full sized tube of this in the mail a little over a week ago from Influenster, and let me just say, I love it! I usually don&#x27;t care what kind of mascara I use because my lashes as long as it is and relatively voluminous, but this gives them even more length and volume while separating my lashes perfectly. I am OBSESSED. It also helps that the packaging is so cute 😊</li>
            <li> Received the product complimentary from Influenster! This is a decent mascara by Covergirl. Actually, it&#x27;s the best by them to me. It&#x27;s decent for the price if you&#x27;re looking for a somewhat quality mascara for cheap.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in the mail from influenster and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve had and I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from my influenster box and although I love that it leaves your lashes soft and natural looking it didn&#x27;t curl my lashes and rather weighed it down. I will definitely keep using it since I am not a fan of crunchy lashes and this works for a subtle look</li>
            <li> I have used Covergirl mascara several times before and I love their products, but the new Covergirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara is by far my favorite. I received it for free from Influenster to try for free and I love using it. It is very easy to use and it always looks great when you put it on. The mascara is just as it is described. When you put it on your lashes are soft and have volume without all the flaking and smudging that you normally get from other mascaras. I believe this is one of the best mascaras that they have and I love how is is cheap and affordable but still a great product. I would recommend this to anybody who wants their lashes to look good everyday.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of mascara&#x27;s.. always have been. When I received this mascara to review from influenster I was excited, to say the least. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Covergirl Lash Blast mascara&#x27;s, so I was expecting to fall in love with this one as well! I was 100% right! This mascara is more amazing than I expected! No mascara has ever made my lashes look as natural than Full Lash Bloom has! I&#x27;m a girl who loves soft, natural looking lashes and this mascara does that PERFECTLY! I am so obsessed with it &amp; it just keeps getting better and better over time! Covergirl continues to impress me!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free from influenster, and I was really excited to try it out. Of all makeup products, mascara is a pretty important one in my book so I tend to be really picky about what I wear.&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I like how, like it says your eyelashes stay soft after application. There&#x27;s none of the crunchy dryness that usually occurs.&lt;br /&gt;It does a nice job of lengthening eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on all day long&lt;br /&gt;Easy to remove&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for length, but it took me 3 coats to get a fuller look which is what I usually go for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great every-day mascara. Probably not something that I would use for a night out, but for an every day basis it gives a nice, natural look.</li>
            <li> I recieved COVERGIRL Bloom complimentary of Influnster, a site used for reviews and trials of full sized products. This review is for the 7-day challenge. I wore it everyday for 7 days to see how it enhanced my look. Personally I really like this mascara. Before recieveing this product, I thought all mascara was the same, but this type is excellant because of the special shape of the bristles. They are long and slightly pointy but this makes it great for perfect lashes everytime. I have noticed a difference in the length of my lashes when I put it on also. I definetly reccomend Bloom mascara to anyone who hates clumpy lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, I was unable to wash off my makeup and I had to reapply the mascara the next morning. It may seem gross, but it still did not clump or look like I had 2 layers of mascara on. This formula is not super thick which does not weigh down my lashes. This mascara is also very easy to remove and does not smear when applying it.</li>
            <li> As a member of the Influenster campaign for this product, I did receive this mascara free in order to test and review it. Mascara is my favorite makeup accessory and I am always looking for the next best thing. The challenge I needed to take with this product was to use it every day for a week in order to see how it changed my regular look. CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara was so weightless and did not leave my eyelashes all clumped up. It also did not flake off throughout the day or dry up and look limp. This mascara has a nice formula and the brush helps you get every lash without feeling like you are going to poke yourself in the eye. I am definitely going to buy myself another once I run out of the one I have now!!</li>
            <li> I received Lash Bloom by Covergirl from Influester and have nothing but great things to say about it! At first I was sketchy because of the rather large brush and tube but it has not only made them look longer but I believe it has made them grow as well. I am very pleased with the results. The look lasts all day and does not pull my eyelashes out when I take it off at night. Super pleased! Definetely will be buying this when I run out. The pic is after one week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> So Influenster gave me the opportunity to test this product for free! I don&#x27;t usually wear mascara because my lashes are very stubborn and do not curl. I love that this mascara adds so much lenth and volume to my lashes and is so lightweight. You can barely tell that the mascara is on. I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s not water proof. I also wish it helped with curling my lashes.</li>
            <li> Got this from #influenster and love it. No more spider lashes, no more stickiness... However, I wish it was waterproof! If it was, it would be the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> I received this free through Influenster and I liked it pretty well. I like a more dramatic look to my lashes but for those days where I just wanted a soft natural look this was my go to mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It is a very light and soft formula.  Does not make lashes feel especially stiff.  The Very Black color is as expected.  I normally prefer a larger thicker brush, but with this formula, the brush provided seems to do a good job of separating my lashes. I don&#x27;t notice it running or flaking throughout the day.  I will continue to buy this as long as it is available from Cover Girl.</li>
            <li> I love this product I got it about a month ago from the Influenster Team and my eye lashes look so thick and long. The problem I have with most mascaras is that they leave my eye lashes clumpy and they&#x27;re hard to take off. In this product leaves them soft and clump-free. It is easy to take off with one wipe, as opposed to the two wipes I normally use to take off other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Out of all the mascara I have tried, the Full Lash Bloom makes my lashes look the longest. My lashes look very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; with this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t clump together and it feels weightless. I recommend this to anyone who desires longer and more natural-looking lashes!</li>
            <li> I was given this mascara to test from Influenster, and I must say I was very impressed. It was one of the best mascaras I have used from Covergirl. My lashes remained soft, and I did not experience any flaking. It lengthened and separated, and I was very impressed that it came off fully when I used makeup wipes or washed my face. This is my new go-to mascara, and I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was given this mascara to review from Influenster in the Bloom Voxbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first application I thought this was just an ordinary mascara and wasn&#x27;t really any different than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  After using for a while I noticed it does feel soft and isn&#x27;t heavy. It stays on but also comes off easily with face wipes. I am considering buying it once I run out.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend. I tried it. but nothing compares to loreal voluminous. feels and looks like you have no mascara on at all. the ads are a gimic. do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Was sent this by influenster and i did the week challenge and loved it my eyelashes feel extremely healthy and its not hard to remove and gives awesome length, it also builds very well.</li>
            <li> It was almost completely dry when I opened the package. The little amount that I could get on was barely noticeable. The brush separates your lashes but having to apply so many coats to get any difference in volume is not worth the effort or time. Plus, you would end up using up the product much sooner than another better formulated mascara. Clever thinking by developers. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with my lash bloom mascara that I got as a complimentary test object through Influenster. Perfect for everyday definitely would suggest to a friend!</li>
            <li> I was given for review purposes the CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara, by Influenster. This mascara is amazing! It is easy to apply because of the thin and correct consistency. The mascara, is soft and gentle. You eyelashes will look flawless and beautiful, but still big and plump.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute new favorite mascara! I have been searching and searching for a drugstore mascara that I really like and I have finally found it. This mascara is absolutely worth the money and you will not be sorry. I was sent he Lash Bloom Blast Mascara from Influenster to try our and review. The mascara has a great formula that does not clump and is very buildable. It lasts all day long and comes off easy with makeup wipes. Thank you Influenster and ‪Covergirl‬ ‪#‎gobloom‬</li>
            <li> This mascara is easy to apply and relatively clump free, but it smudges and flakes pretty easily leaving you with raccoon eyes within a couple hours. I have not tried the waterproof version, but even without sweating or my eyes watering, it was a bad situation most days.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, not exceptional. I will say this though, I did go out with this mascara on during a rainy day and the mascara did not smear or anything. (It isn&#x27;t even a water proof formula!) I did like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I did get this mascara free from influenster though...just saying...</li>
            <li> I got this pretty stuff for FREE from Influenster, just to try! #gobloom is such a fun campaign :)I really like this mascara! I wish I could give it 4.5 and here&#x27;s why- it does a great job on the lashes, it lengthens and separates without looking clumpy. It doesn&#x27;t flake over the course of a day, it&#x27;s a great dark black for just enough drama! The tube is a cute pink color, which doesn&#x27;t affect the performance but I still love it! The brush cleaner in the tube isn&#x27;t great though- sometimes (maybe 1 time out of 10) the brush comes out with globs of mascara on the bristles or the end. It makes for a messy application, or a mess of trying to get the globs off. Overall, though, I love it!!</li>
            <li> I was sent a tube of Full Lash Bloom for free from Influenster to test. I do like the product a lot, as it stands out against typically plain black tubes. As far as the mascara itself, it gives great volume and definition. I was not a fan on the clumpiness, and the applicator was not defined enough to comb through those clumps one on my lashes. Along those same lines, removing the mascara even with makeup removing was a chore. Overall it gives a great look, but application and removal is difficult.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara as a complimentary gift from Influenster for testing purposes. I have been a longtime fan of the LashBlast macaras, but this one has an even better formula that I can use right away instead of waiting for it to dry out a little to its optimal texture. The brush and application is smooth and leaves my lashes feathery and separated and not crusty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in brown since I enjoy that Covergirl makes the best true brown mascaras, but I still use the black for more dramatic looks. Definitely try it out!</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster. I love the natural look it gives and lasts all day. I have been having many issues with my eyes lately I suspect from another mascara. This is gentle and not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am not giving a 5 is because the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; (not sure the appropriate word) are so small that I almost poked my eye because I am used to longer ones. You have to get really close to your eye. But I haven&#x27;t had an issue after the initial application.</li>
            <li> I did not like the applicator. It was a bit messy and clumpy. The mascara irritates my eyes a little. Not nearly as good as their professional series, which is my current favorite.</li>
            <li> Thank you for my item will buy again.</li>
            <li> I received this complementary to try from Influenster. I&#x27;m amazed by this product. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave black marks around your eyes when you look down. i love the mascara and feel that it worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary from Influester to test and review. I love it! It&#x27;s not too heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from influenster. I  love how cover girl packaged this mascara and it last all day Lon.</li>
            <li> I reccieved CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara free from influenser. I have been using it for a little over a week and am in love. I&#x27;ve spent crazy money on designer mascara and they all clump and make me look like I have 3 eye lashes. Full Bloom spread my eyelash and created great length. It&#x27;s a light mascara but does all it should and more. I would recomend this to everyone! it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. This is mascara is easy to use and I love the plastic applicator. More for a natural look rather than a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I love the light feeling. And the way it comes out afterwards, it&#x27;s perfect for my everyday use!  Thanks @Influenster</li>
            <li> I love this mascara it doesn&#x27;t bulk up like most mascara.it give your eyelashes a lil fullness and make your eyes seem a lil bigger I give this product a five . This is this first cover girl mascara I actually like because I normally use maybelline</li>
            <li> I like them but they kind of make my eyelashes &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34; if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> This looks good and is easy to apply.  It will make you lashes fuller.  I have used several top brands and they were more than double the price of this and this gives equal if not better results.</li>
            <li> I tried this mascara for free for testing purposes from Influenster and I loved it! The first thing I noticed was the adorable packaging my favorite color is pink so I love the tube and it has cute little flowers on it! The mascara brush itself is just amazing because the pedals are long and short making it perfect for getting ever lash and that is very important! It really meets it&#x27;s goal at making your eyelashes soft and just makes them Bloom!</li>
            <li> I received the CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara complements of Influenster for testing purposes! This mascara is AWESOME! There is no clumping and it is so natural looking! Doesn&#x27;t go on thick or leave your eyelashes feeling heavy! I have completed the 7-day challenge and have seen personally how much Lash Bloom Mascara has enhanced my look! Will absolutely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free for review from Influenster, and I absolutely love it. I can layer it as many times as I like, and it stays soft and flexible. It&#x27;s also very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be sent the COVERGIRL Full LashBlast Mascara by Influenster. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes in return for my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I love the packaging. It&#x27;s super cute and pink is my favorite color.  The smell is typical mascara smell. But I am not crazy about wand. I, for one, dislike plastic wands - something about them. However, I do like the detailing tip that helps me get the inner corners of my lashed without getting mascara all over my lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I do love the formula! It gives you voluminous, soft lashes and a bit of curve. I also love that they use beeswax in their formula to provide buildable volume. It also isn&#x27;t super wet and dries quickly. I also experienced no flaking, even after sleeping in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about $8, this is a great mascara. I would replace the wand with a non-plastic one and this would be an amazing mascara. ‪#‎goBloom‬</li>
            <li> I  received the this product complimentary from Influenster, and I tried it for seven whole days to test it out. It&#x27;s a good mascara, it doesn&#x27;t clump up as much as other brands, but I did not notice a difference after a week. It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and didn&#x27;t flake off too much. It&#x27;s not the greatest but it&#x27;s pretty decent. I gave it 3 outta five stars because there wasn&#x27;t anything I could say was totally outstanding about it, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it either.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It never clumps and it makes my eyelashes look so much longer! I was able to try this mascara through Influenster for testing purposes and I&#x27;m glad I did! I will be buying this again after I run out of this tube.</li>
            <li> I received the product complimentary from Influenster and I love it. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few mascaras and I&#x27;m very picky about the ones I like but this mascara is just amazing. It doesn&#x27;t clump, it makes my eyelashes look so much longer and it just makes my blue eyes pop!!</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every drugstore brand mascara on the market and this is by far one of the worst. I think that I would have had softer lashes if I dipped them in tar and let it dry. The mascara provides lots of volume with just two coats, but the definition that comes with it is less than satisfactory. My lashes were thick and dark, but very clumped. I also could not get this mascara off of my lashes for the life of me. I could take two showers and use eye makeup remover multiple times, and the mascara application from three days prior would still be gummed onto my poor lashes. I think I lost a few too many of my eyelashes during the several weeks I tried to make this mascara work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CoverGirl Clump Crusher for awhile but thought I&#x27;d give this a try to see if I liked it even better. Nope. Going back to Clump Crusher. This mascara seemed very dry right from the start. The first few times it looked like I had nothing on my lashes but within days it was clumpy on the brush and left clumps on my lashes unless I was extremely careful. I now find myself trying to scrape clumps off the brush before I try to apply it to my lashes. Disappointing. I thought this might be even better than Clump Crusher.</li>
            <li> Great product! Never clumps but did seem to dry out a little faster than expected. Loved it while it lasted!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara! It&#x27;s like Clump Crush, and Lashblast had a baby and made LashBloom! Gives great volume and separation. Doesn&#x27;t clump, keeps my curl, and the best part, you can remove it with makeup removing wipes! I think Covergirl should have their whole &amp;#34;Lash&amp;#34; line of mascaras infused with the beewax that&#x27;s in this mascara. It would make it so much easier to remove the mascara before bed :D I will repurchase with out a doubt!</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary mascara courtesy of Influenster, and was very impressed! I have tried a lot of mascaras that are much more expensive and didn&#x27;t do quite the same job. These made my eyelashes look gorgeous, and lasted an entire workday. Typically my mascara loses its effect by mid afternoon, but this one looked impressive until I got home around 7pm. It holds up well and I like how well it goes on.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara its great for length and volume!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara to test by Influenster and I absolutely LOVE this mascara. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I can tell that my lashes are healthier! My lashes are naturally super long so I always struggle with mascara&#x27;s giving me length instead of volume but this mascara does both perfectly!</li>
            <li> I like the applicator.  It is not waterproof, but does not smudge much. It does flake of pretty easily though and leaves black marks on my cheeks, so I have to look in myself in the mirror every so often. It does go on smooth though and doesn&#x27;t really clump for me. I think a lot of that has to do with the style of the applicator.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. I love how it applies and how it looks :)</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favorite mascaras. Its very build able &amp; super black on the lashes too. I really love everything about it!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! I&#x27;m very happy with the product, goes on smoothly. The price is great, for well worth it. I got 4 of them and I&#x27;m thinking of getting more</li>
            <li> So I have been using Revlon Mascara forever. Recently something changed with the formula and my beloved mascara became unusable due to extreme clumping. I&#x27;ve been looking for a new mascara over the past few months and I am glad to say I finally found it! This mascara looks so good. My eyelashes look long and full and best there isn&#x27;t a single clump! I was so excited to be able to continue to build on the overall look of this mascara without ruining my eyelashes with clumpy awfulness!. I am so glad my search is over. Also This mascara was about $2 cheaper here on amazon than it was in my local WalyWorld. So, Score!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is one of my favorite mascaras. I got it as a complimentary gift from Influenster for testing purposes.  Love the texture it leaves my eyelashes, very natural look and not clumpy at all. This is def. my go-to mascara for day looks or for the office. Hands down, fave mascara. Please try it out and see for yourself what I&#x27;m talking about!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in the shade Very Black free from Influenster for product testing purposes and opinions are 100% my own. I have been using this product for about a week now and I have to say I was impressed! I LOVE COVERGIRL mascaras and wear it daily. I love that it does not make my lashes feel hard or smudge throughout the day like other mascaras I have used. I love my lashes to look long and full and this does just that. I am completely satisfied with this mascara and will definitely continue to recommend! Thanks COVERGIRL!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this mascara. I actually received it in a Influenster box and I must say, it&#x27;s pretty awesome! No complaints so far and I&#x27;ve used it for the past 4 days.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I received it from Influenster free of charge for reviewing purposes. Its affordable, as Covergirl always is. I love the brush because I try to bring out the ends of my lashes and its got the perfect rounded tip to do that without stabing yourself in the eye, haha. Great black color, doesn&#x27;t clump. I put two coats on and it stays on the whole day. Overall, another awesome product from Covergirl.</li>
            <li> I received a full size of Lash Bloom Mascara courtesy of Influenster. For the past week I have used this mascara I have noticed it seperated my lashes and added lift</li>
            <li> This mascara is great if you are not looking for volume or length, but just to coat what you already have. It is great for a more natural looking lash that is not clumpy.</li>
            <li> I received this as a tester through influenster in return for a review. I have long straight light lashes. I&#x27;ve used for a week and I absolutely love it. It makes my lashes look soo much better than what I used to use (great lash). It is softer and don&#x27;t clump as much. Also, i slept with it on one night and it didn&#x27;t rub off, still looked good. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> While I do like the length that this mascara gave to my lashes, I still felt that it clumped up a little more than I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> I am really excited about CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara. I received this mascara from Influenster to test this product. I have to say that it has been my favorite to review so far. I have been using the very black 800 and it is true to its name: very black. I love the definition and this mascara is great for building length as well. My lashes look thick, full and long. Usually with a mascara this good, the formula makes my lashes heavy and they feel very fake. With Lash Bloom, my lashes still feel soft and malleable to the touch. Overall, great new product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, normally I always have a dark Smokey eye, with dark eyeliner, eye shadow, and the one product I can&#x27;t live without mascara. When I received this product I opened it up, washed all my makeup off and applyed just the mascara. I love this! My eyelashes are longer, fuller and sexier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Truly wish I could give this product 10 stars!!! I&#x27;ve always envied the ones with long lashes and have tried several products promising to help with lash growth or even mascaras promising those long lush looking lashes with just one application. Every product has disappointed me until now. This mascara is amazing!! I have LONG lashes now!!!</li>
            <li> I received a free full sized bottle of the full lash bloom mascara for trial purposes via Influenster! I live this product! I have very blonde lashes and this makes them look long thick and gorgeous! Very little if any clumping and very light weight! I say buy buy buy!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara!! I received it through Influenster. The mascara is nice and light, doesn&#x27;t clump and looks great! Most mascaras that give you length also clump of look too heavy. This one does not do that at all! I think it is well worth the price and is a mascara that I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for review. I&#x27;ve always loved the CoverGirl mascaras and this one did not disappoint! It was just as great as the original Lash Blast as well as the Clump Crusher which was my favorite mascara before. Now I&#x27;m not so sure which one is my favorite. I really love them both. It volumes and lengthens, which are both important to me. Love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from influenster, the brush is very fine and spread out so ppl like me can wiggle through lashes and volumize them I love it!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive this mascara from Influenster to try out. I am picky about mascaras because my lashes are lacking in every aspect. This mascara is okay if you aren&#x27;t looking for full on glamour volume and length which is what I go for. However, that is not what this mascara is marketed towards. It is marketed towards &amp;#34;touchably soft full lashes.&amp;#34; I would say if you use less than two coats you would achieve that. I would just be weary about piling on the layers with this mascara. All in all though this mascara is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from influenster, I was excited to use it but i was a bit disappointed. It&#x27;s an okay mascara, but it&#x27;s not amazing. I liked other mascaras by COVERGIRL better. But this is still a decent mascara</li>
            <li> I received this mascara to try from Influenster...I&#x27;ve used it for a week and have been happy with the mascara. It gives me soft, natural looking lashes. It would be good for a weekend look, or a no-makeup look. I did like the comb brush, it helped to separate and give my lashes length. Very minimal volume, this is NOT a dramatic mascara!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I received this full size complimentary from influenster to try and review this product. I love how it separates your lashes and gives me awesome volume! Lasted all day and left my lashes soft !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now thanks to the free full size sample from Influenster! LOVE IT!! Great volume and look!</li>
            <li> I received this product from Influenster.com a little over a week ago, and I love it. It&#x27;s a very buildable mascara that provides a lot of length and definition. I never have any troubles with clumps or excess. There isn&#x27;t much of a volumizing effect, but if you&#x27;re looking for a clean, classic look, this mascara is perfect.</li>
            <li> received from influenster to test and I love this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t even feel or look like I have any on when I wear it. It does have a dry formula which isn&#x27;t pleasing to everyone, but I personally love it.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara last week complimentary from Influenster, and let me tell you people, this stuff is awesome! It&#x27;s a perfect affordable alternative to Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real. The brush is awesome because it spreads the mascara out enough that it costs the lashes immensely but doesn&#x27;t clump. I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I DID receive this mascara for free as an Influenster campaign, to test and review products. Seeing as mascara is the one product that I absolutely must wear daily, I was quite excited to be able to try this as a brand new product. I would say that this is definitely a high quality mascara for the price. The mascara lasted all throughout the work day with out smudging or flaking off. As the package suggests, it did make your lashes very soft, however, I am not sure that this is a huge issue that warrants it&#x27;s own special product line of mascara. It gave a decent amount of volume, and did not appear to clump while I was applying it. For a drug store buy, I would recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> I recieved this mascara complimentary of influenster and i absolutely love it.  i was never a big mascara fan only false lashes...now i find myself just using this mascara and nothing else. it never clumps or gives me a problem and its easy to remove...i dont get those black circles in the mroning from stubborn mascara that never comes off. definitely a must have and im definitely buying again. thanks influenster!!!</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I received the mascara for free as an Influenster campaign, to test and review products. As mascara is probably my go to product, I have tried SEVERAL mascaras over the years varying in price and specification. This was an exceptional product for its price range! It lasted several hours, without flaking or smudging, gave me incredible lift and volume!</li>
            <li> CoverGirl Bloom Mascara was given to me, free, by Influenster.com to test out. The verdict is in, I&#x27;m in love! This mascara makes my eyelashes pop without all the flaking, clumping mess. I love that it is touchable, all day! It makes me feel naturally beautiful. I am so happy with this product. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, either! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I tried this product out for seven days straight, even forgot to remove it one night, with no issues! My eyelashes were beautiful all day, everyday. I have to say, this is my new favorite mascara. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> i got this as a free sample to try from influenster. this was the first time ive used this, and i am very happy. as the product says, it is a very soft mascara, which i love. the only downfall is its not waterproof... this makes me hesitant to actually purchase this product because i wear contacts and use eye drops a lot, so i need something waterproof</li>
            <li> this mascara is OK. it&#x27;s just like the package says, its not very &#x27;wet&amp;#34; and it won&#x27;t make your lashes hard or super black. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for your lower lashes because it does tend to rub off and smudge, thus making you underage appear darker. i guess i would just use it on my expensive falsies, that way they don&#x27;t get ruined or anything of that sort.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free via influenster in order to share my non biased opinion. The brush teeth were rubbery which is not normally what I use (I&#x27;m a diorshow girl) a Diorshow comparable product this is not even with using the diorshow mascara primer my lashes didn&#x27;t look any different. This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever used that did nothing for me, however the color was nice a dark black this is the reason for the second star.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very nice for casual everyday use. It does separate, lengthen and darken the lashes. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to add any volume to my lashes whatsoever. The brush is very nice and firm so it can really comb through easily. The smell isn&#x27;t harsh like other mascaras, though it is still present. Packaging is also very cute and feminine! I really like this mascara and could see myself purchasing it in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product free by Influenster for reviewing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received the Cover Girl Full Lash Bloom free from Influenster, I was given this free to submit my review, and was not paid in any form for the following review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a large collection of different mascaras due to the fact that my eye lashes are very thin and short- almost non existing - and I try product after product trying to achieve the results I want. After using Cover Girl Full Lash Bloom Mascara I really liked what it did to my eyelashes. It separated and lengthened my lashes and I never experienced any flaky, spikey and hard lashes that other mascaras tend to cause. It also seemed like my lashes curled! This Full Lash Bloom mascara does what other high costing mascaras do for about 1/3 of the price. Which is awesome! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was sent given a full sized sample of ‪COVERGIRLFull Lash Bloom‬ by ‪‎Lash Blast Mascara‬ from ‪‎Influenster‬ to test out and review! I have always been a bit put off with the small bristles of most mascaras but I was surprisingly surprised that my eye lashes did not clump! I would recommend this mascara since it coats the whole lash very well. The only thing that was a bit annoying for me was the non water proof-ness of it. I live in Chicago so the snow against my face would melt the black onto my eye lids. Nothing a little water couldn&#x27;t fix but I would definitely opt for a water proof mascara version instead!</li>
            <li> I loved this mascara. It gave me perfect lashes every time I used it. It never clumped and I only ever had to use one coat on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Received this from Influencenster - found that the mascsra clumped easily. Was not satisfied with the brush at all. After using it for over a week I made the brush work.</li>
            <li> I received CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara for free from Influenster to review. I have very sparse short eyelashes so I am always looking for new mascaras to make them longer and fuller. I found the wand of the mascara difficult to manuever and it missed a lot of lashes. I did find that when I used a lengthening mascara and then added the full bloom mascara on top of them my lashes looked great! Overall if you have long lashes, this mascara is great to add extra volume and length. If not, skip it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing. It makes my lashes look really full and long, but not too long. It&#x27;s great to use for everyday but also good for night. It comes off pretty easily with make up remover but lasts pretty much the whole day. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. I received one to try from Influenster and it&#x27;s worked very well for me. It makes my lashes full and dark, with quite a bit of length. It holds a curl pretty well too. I don&#x27;t get as much volume as I would like, but honestly no mascara really gives me the volume I want. Overall this is a great mascara. It&#x27;s lightweight and it doesn&#x27;t get all dry and clumpy on my lashes either.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from influenster.  I wore it everyday for a week and love how full and natural it made my eyelashes look.  Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  I wear contacts and it&#x27;s a great mascara to wear with them.  It doesn&#x27;t clump and does an excellent job thickening and lengthening!</li>
            <li> CoverGirl Lash Bloom Mascara leaves your lashes looking great. This color is very black but really doesn&#x27;t feel like that is more like black. I highly recommend this one. I love it,</li>
            <li> i received this product for review from influentser. i didn&#x27;t really like it on my natural eyelashes, my eyes water and it was way too runny for me. with that in mind, i think this would be great on false eyelashes. i say that because it would make reusing and cleaning them easier, it isn&#x27;t a thick formula to remove either and i&#x27;ll give it that. i did like that, because no one likes scrubbing off mascara at the end of a night out.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in the shade Very Black free from Influenster for product testing and review. I enjoy it! It does not leave the hard, crunchy feeling on my lashes like some other mascaras. I have found that it&#x27;s a great everyday mascara for natural makeup looks. I wore it throughout the whole work day without any flaking or smudging, and at the end of the day it melted right off with makeup remover. ((This formula isn&#x27;t waterproof, so don&#x27;t wear this out to see a sad movie or anything.))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty long lashes already, so it isn&#x27;t a problem to me that this mascara doesn&#x27;t do much for lengthening or volumizing. If it&#x27;s drama you&#x27;re after, you&#x27;ll need to reach for Benefit or Makeup Forever, crunchy though they may be</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster to test out. So far I&#x27;ve used it for 7 days and it&#x27;s working nicely. It is still a bit stuff, but much better than other brands. I like it a lot so far!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I always use covergirl&#x27;s line of mascara and was incredibly excited when I found out I was selected to use this product for testing. This is a great new formula. It is light on my eyes with application and does not clump or get crusty after wear all day. I cannot make any complaints about the full lash bloom formula. After a week of use I am extremely satistfied.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free from Influenster. The packaging is very pretty and I like the applicator. However, the mascara does not lengthen as much as I expected. It fills out my lashes so they look thicker, but not longer.  Overall, i would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I received Lash Bloom Mascara complimentary from Influenster and here is my review.    After 7 days of wearing this mascara, I have decided that it is not too bad. I love the color and how it doesn&#x27;t make them too wild looking unlike some other products I have tried. My eyes looked bigger for sure which is something I always look for in a good mascara. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it tended to flake a bit after a few hours of wearing it and I would find it on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara at a great price. It is exactly as described by Covergirl - a softer mascara that does not short you on volume or length. Anyone who has tried SoftLashes would LOVE this. I only drop it to four stars because it is not paraben free or natural.</li>
            <li> I received this product from complimentary from Influenster and am so glad I did! I was in need of new mascara and was unsure what to buy when my GoBloom VoxBox arrived. The second I used this mascara, my lashes looked longer and thicker. This product is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I received CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara complimentary from Influenster to test and review. I used the product for a week already. I really like how the mascara fans out my lashes and separates them. It doesn&#x27;t give me the full length that I like but I have really liked this mascara. The brush is nice and doesn&#x27;t leave any clumps. I have learned that if I use several coats of mascara then it&#x27;ll help lengthen the lashes a little more. Overall, this is a great product especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I admit that I color shop and specifically buy makeup that is in a pink container, but this mascara is actually a great purchase. It makes your lashes fuller without clumping. It&#x27;s log pasting and not flakey. The listing price of $17 is a little high for drugstore mascara, but if you can snag for &amp;#60;$10, it&#x27;s an excellent buy. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from influenster for testing purposes. I loved it. I have used other CoverGirl products before and this mascara so far is my favorite. The advice I would give us you don&#x27;t need more than 2 coats otherwise it gets clumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used CoverGirl mascara before, but this is my favorite so far! I&#x27;ve always had really bad flakes with mascara, but I haven&#x27;t had any with the Bloom mascara! It makes my eyelashes super long and thick looking, but still feels soft and natural instead of hard and crunchy. It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite and I will definitely be using it from here on out!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes*</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as a complimentary try out from Influenster.com. I am amazed with how well it works. I am very picky when it comes to mascara.I went ahead a did the 7 day challenge and I instantly fell in love! There is no clumping, the look I get when I apply it is outstanding. My lashes look fuller and the mascara lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in very black from influenster free to try and review. After using it for the first time I immediately loved the results, it did not leave my lashes stiff that they hurt to move them but made them stay in place. It has not flaked on me either which I like. Over all it is a good mascara wished I had received it in water proof.</li>
            <li> When I first received this mascara for free from Influenster I was super excited. I&#x27;m mean seriously its pink! And these types of wants are my favorite. Very stiff and spiky so I know that my lashes will be separated. When I first tried it, I was a little let down because it took me forever to get the product to build up because I like my lashes to be long and separated and BAM in your face. I didn&#x27;t give up though I tried it again but this time I used another mascara to plump them up a bit and to give the cover girl mascara something to build up on. Came out AMAZING. That day I went to the dentist and she even asked me what kind of mascara I used because she said they looked so long without any clumps.</li>
            <li> I, too, received this mascara in an Influenster Voxbox. I was SO impressed with this mascara. It volumizes, lengthens, and helps keep lashes soft while still looking beautiful. I don&#x27;t worry about breakage or flaking with this product. It doesn&#x27;t smudge and lasts a good 12 hours before it needs reapplying.</li>
            <li> Great mascara! I got this complimentary from Influenster to try out and review, and it really a good mascara, but I&#x27;d recommend buying it from the drugstore. It separates my lashes and curls them, but I still think my L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Voluminous mascara works better in volume. I would definitely recommend it though!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last seven days and I really do like it. My favorite things about it:&lt;br /&gt;1. it is natural looking no mascara chunks or caking&lt;br /&gt;2.  ophthalmology tested - as a contact wearer this is extremely important to me. This mascara did not make my eyes itchy!&lt;br /&gt;3. A few coats and I&#x27;m done. This goes on in less than a minute and I don&#x27;t need 10+ coats to get the look that I am going for.&lt;br /&gt;4. Pretty Long Lasting and easy to take off at the end of the day with a make up wipe&lt;br /&gt;Overall I loved it and gave it 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I was given this product complimentary by Influenster for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.**</li>
            <li> I got this mascara from Influesnter in my very first Voxbox and I love it. Definitely will be purchasing this in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Covergirl products always exceed my expectations and I recommend getting this mascara if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t flake! Also the brush is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Got from influenster for free and I LOVE it!!! Makes my lashes look fantastic! I totally notice a lash growth difference!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from influenster for testing and review purposes. I have to say im really impressed by this mascara because I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like but I actually did. I did the seven day challenge and I notice that it didn&#x27;t make my lashes look or feel crunchy like my other mascara does. It made them really long and separated which Is what I look in a mascara. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone who loves long and separated lashes!</li>
            <li> I used CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom for a week, thanks to Influenster. It gives a natural look to your lashes, it doesn&#x27;t give extra volume, yet it gives enough to lift your lashes and make it look as glamorous as it should naturally. It doesn&#x27;t cake on to your lashes no matter how hard you try to cake it on. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use this on a daily basis, just because it doesn&#x27;t volumize my lashes as much as I wish it did. I recommend it for people looking for a natural look.</li>
            <li> I loved this mascara! My lashes have never looked this good! The brush is amazing and so is the product! Such sleek packaging and a very very good product!</li>
            <li> I tried this mascara every day for the past week. It&#x27;s very soft, and doesn&#x27;t clump or  make my lashes feel still. I will certainly be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster, I received this amazing mascara for free and oh my gosh...let me just say that after a week of using it, I went ahead and bought a few more for myself, my sisters, and my mom! It is really the best mascara I&#x27;ve used in a long long time!! The brush applicator is so easy to apply the mascara and does not leave my lashes clumpy at all. This is definitely a worthy buy!!</li>
            <li> Super lightweight and doesn&#x27;t clump or flake. Haven&#x27;t worn another mascara since receiving this free from Influenster for testing purposes. Definitely will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara from Influenster and I actually love it. It  is perfect for natural makeup looks and makes me eyelashes super soft. This isn&#x27;t my favorite mascara but I will definitely be keeping it as part of my collection.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free from Influenster in the shade Very Black. After a week of using the mascara I have REALLY loved the product. It goes on smooth, lasts all day and does not clump. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of mascara and this really blew me away. Generally I purchase higher name brand like Dior, Tarte, etc.. and never really considered Covergirl. Boy have i been missing out!!!! I received this mascara as complimentary for testing purposes by Influenster and I have been using this the past 4 days ( huge shocker for me). It really lengthens your lashes and the color Very Black (800) defines your lashes , almost falsie like. The wand is great a separating the lashes and you dont get any clumps. I add several layers to my lashes to make them full. Thanks Cover Girl!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for reviewing purposes through Influenster. Although I do not use drugstore mascara I was excited to try this one because wearing lashes can be a bit time consuming. This mascara is great for volume and length. I love the shape of the brush it makes it so easy to apply to achieve the desired look. They also do leave your lashes soft to the touch unlike many other mascaras I have used. I wear contacts and it did not bother me at all.  This worked out great for me because I have full long lashes and it gives you that extra lift. This is definitely something worth trying.</li>
            <li> For me it only takes 2 coats for my lashes to look flawless. Love how light weight the mascara feels as well! I was sent this product complimentary from Influenster to test and review!</li>
            <li> I received the covergirl full lash bloom for free. It does leave you lash soft. It gives you a natural, no clumpy look. If you are looking for some serious volume, this alone will not do the job. #goBloom #influenster #covergirl #gotitfree</li>
            <li> Got this as a voxbox from influenster and it&#x27;s really fabulous. It goes on so smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes feeling hard and gross like a lot of mascaras do.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara for free to try as part of an Influenster campaign, and was excited to see if it lived up to the claims the commercials make. I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day for over a week, and overall I&#x27;m impressed. This is a good mascara for natural looks, as it gives lashes just a hint of thickness. It&#x27;s fairly lengthening and leaves lashes feeling soft, not brittle. I&#x27;ve been using Dior Iconic Overcurl mascara for a while now, and this will not replace it; it just doesn&#x27;t do for my lashes what Dior does. I have, however, tried using this as a second coat over the Dior mascara, and the results are great! If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive, natural-looking mascara, this is definitely one to try.</li>
            <li> I did receive this as a tester from Influenster! But I love the product! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week strait and I honestly don&#x27;t know how I lived without it. It&#x27;s amazing. It makes my lashes feel great and it never clumps! I will totally be buying this every time I need more mascara.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free as an Influenster, to test and review the product. I honestly hate trying new mascara because I&#x27;m always worried about clumping. but this doesn&#x27;t have any of that. It goes on smoothly and it leaves my lashes feeling light. It looks great and is definitely worth the store value.</li>
            <li> I received my lash bloom for free from influenster to treat and review and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! No more clumps and my lashes feel so soft! It is a little hard to get my bottom lashes without smearing mascara but not completely impossible. Would definitely buy this product.</li>
            <li> I did receive this for free from Influenster. I have tried many mascaras and this one is without a doubt in my top 3. This mascara gives my lashes a really natural look without the clumping. It lengthens my lashes to perfection and leaves my lashes so light. Overall I love this product and will surely be buying in the future.</li>
            <li> I recieved a full size sample of covergirl full lash bloom completely complementary from influenster. I am in love with it! It makes my lashes look normal and soft. I would definately recommend it and will be purchasing it once mine is gone. I recommend it for any woman who wears mascara all the time and wants it to look natural with no flaking or wearing down. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes; however, they lack fullness/volume. Many mascaras will make my lashes look longer, but not add a natural looking volume. Before trying this mascara I was using LashBlast Volume mascara (the \\&quot;orange\\&quot; one). It was my go to mascara until sampling this one! It definitely makes my lashes seem longer and fuller. It adds natural looking volume and does not apply \\&quot;clumpy\\&quot; like other mascaras. As a contact wearer I have had no issues. I have been using it everyday for 2 weeks and I can say that it is new \\&quot;go to\\&quot; mascara. FULL DISCLAIMER: I received this mascara from Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li> !NOTE! I received the CoverGirl Full Lush Bloom Mascara complimentary from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt; I took part in the 7-day challenge to see how much Lash Bloom Mascara grew on me and to see how it enhanced my look over time! First, I&#x27;d like to say that this product is very nice and the black from the mascara really made my lashes pop. I already have long lashes so it didn&#x27;t really make a difference to me. The packaging is cute and the brush is also cute. I don&#x27;t really care for the price but I do think it&#x27;s a good buy. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great! It gives volume and definition without any clumps or smudging. It makes your ashes gigantic!</li>
            <li> I was sent this product by Influenster and completely feel in love with it. Great retail price, great length, and great brush. Goes on smooth, stays in great throughout the day and never gets flaky. Love it!</li>
            <li> This mascara was given to me free from Influenster, and I am a total mascara junkie. I love trying out new ones and have tried a variety of different brands, from drug store to high end. This has been my go-to mascara since I got it! I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it, really! My favorite part is the amount of product that dispenses on the wand. There&#x27;s not too much and the formula isn&#x27;t wet or thick. It&#x27;s just right! When there&#x27;s too much product on the wand, that&#x27;s when you get clumps! I literally don&#x27;t get clumps with this even if I try 2 or more coats. 1 coat works great, but 2 is even better, I think! :)</li>
            <li> This mascara is the perfect blend of touchable and dramatic. Nicely outlines each lash without clumping - all the way to the tip. I even prefer this to the green Lash Blast! This is now my go-to, daily mascara.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying this in the future. I was given a chance to test a full size product from influenster for free, and I absolutely love it! It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes clumpy at all, and after it&#x27;s on it has some movement to it. It doesn&#x27;t make your lashes stiff and brittle all day. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to my friends!</li>
            <li> I got this product free to try from Influenster and I&#x27;m in love with it. I don&#x27;t have very long eyelashes, so I need a product that makes them look longer and isn&#x27;t too heavy. This product is perfect. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t clump. Only problem I had was when I left it in the car overnight and it froze. Haha...had a difficult time putting it on then!!</li>
            <li> I recieved COVERGIRL Bloom complimentary of Influnster, a site used for reviews and trials of full sized products. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I really like this product. The formula doesn&#x27;t clump and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my lashes. The one thing that I had a small problem with was that by the end of the day it seemed as if I didn&#x27;t have any of it left on. Overall though I was really impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara compliments of Influenster. Unfortunately, it did not work with my lashes. I have stick straight Asian lashes and I knew once I saw that it was not waterproof it would not work. Once I applied it to my freshly curled lashes they immediately went straight. Normally, I would try my trick of applying waterproof first, then applying a coat of a non waterproof mascara, but I did not. The wand is plastic and does not apply evenly. As a disclaimer I am also not a fan of CoverGirl as it is a product of Proctor &amp; Gamble, one of the largest companies known for animal testing. I just can&#x27;t love a product that tests on animals. I do my best to use alternate brands with more animal friendly lines. Thanks anyway, Influenster.</li>
            <li> As you can see from my before and after picture my lashes are much fuller and this is just one coat of mascara. My lashes are not clumped together and they are not hard at all. The drying time was really quick and the product did not smudge during the day when I rubbed my eyes. Another great thing about this product was that I did not have any flaking, Overall I really enjoyed this mascara. You can check out my blog http://christinasharnelle.blogspot.com/ to see how I got to try this product and other products for free from influenster.</li>
            <li> I received this from a voxbox and I must admit I do really enjoy it. It by not means beats out my &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; mascara by benefit, but it is a good everyday natural mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes a natural black color.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned that this mascara is perfect for a natural, effortless looking eyelash look, and they&#x27;re entirely correct.  One coat of this product will only slightly darken and lengthen your lashes, while leaving them very soft to the touch.  In order to really amp up the look, and see noticeable lengthening, volumizing, and pigmentation, you&#x27;ll likely need to use 3 coats.  At least.  Normally, that would be a recipe for disaster, as so many other mascaras clump, giving us those unsightly and uncomfortable &amp;#34;spider&amp;#34; lashes.  Happily, this one does not.  I found that even though I really had to apply quite a bit of the product, the brush worked wonders in terms of keeping my lashes separated, so that I could see the full effect of the formula in terms of the aforementioned length and volume.  Now, those two qualities won&#x27;t be earth-shattering or miraculous even if you layer on the product, but what you will see is a fair amount of volume and length with a decent amount of pigmentation so that the final look is pretty but not overdone, and your lashes will still feel soft and not even a little &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have extremely sensitive eyes and I wear contacts, so for all of those in either or both of those boats with me, I have to say that this didn&#x27;t give me any issues whatsoever.  I was also able to remove it very, very easily with just warm water and a little bit of Dove soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the downsides are concerned, I didn&#x27;t have any issues at all with smudging even on my lower lashes, but there was some flaking -- it wasn&#x27;t a huge amount, but it did happen.  Additionally, I noticed that as I would remove the wand from the tube, there would be some small globs of product stuck to the bristles; some of those wound up transferring to my lashes, but after I went over the areas a few times, the brush did an excellent job of distributing that product and ensuring that my lashes continued to be nicely separated.  *Ido have to note that even with those small globs, this wasn&#x27;t at all a messy mascara to apply: usually, I wind up with some on my eyelids (much to my frustration) regardless of how carefully I apply whatever mascara I&#x27;m using at the time, but I didn&#x27;t have that issue at all with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s not a perfect product, but with multiple coats, the resulting lash look is pretty good.  So, for everyone looking for a decent mascara, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d regret giving this one a try.</li>
            <li> I received the covergirl full lash bloom mascara free from Influenster, I was given this free to submit my review, and was not paid in any form for the following review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first application of the mascara I was a little unsure of it, it pulled at my eyelashes and I am not sure what caused that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple uses, I started to really like the mascara. I no longer was experiencing that weird pull. What I loved the most about the mascara was that it did a great job at separating my eyelashes and making them look full. Also, my eyelashes looked longer with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I believe I have had some sort of reaction to the mascara. I have never experienced any issues with makeup or mascara, and have used Covergirl mascara many times in the past. I noticed in the past few weeks, I was starting to develop eczema under my eyes, and my eyes were very puffy and red. I looked as though I had about 5 bags under my eyes, UGH! Well, I tried to figure out what the issue was, either the dry weather or the new mascara. I stopped using the mascara about 4-5 days ago, and this issue had stopped. I&#x27;ve been exfoliating my skin on a daily basis and this helped also. So, I do not fully know if this caused my issue, but it has been bad enough that I am hesitating going back to this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone, I enjoyed the results, but believe my reaction may not have been from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECAP:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Budget Friendly&lt;br /&gt;Separates Lashes&lt;br /&gt;Long, Full Lashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;May have given me eczema</li>
            <li> I received this mascara via Influenster! I must say that that this mascara is very different from anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. The packaging does not lie when it says it will leave your lashes soft to the touch. Other mascaras have left my lashes very crunchy and sometimes cause them to fall out. With Lash Bloom it is a very soft look and not to heavy or gothic. Just enough product comes out on the brush to ensure it is evenly coated with no clumps of bumps. I  didn&#x27;t experience any flakes and it last the whole day through all my classes. Would definitely recommend this for the busy college student who wants to add a little pop to her every day makeup routine or the busy working woman!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster to review, and I opened the package without a single expectation. When I applied it to my lashes, I quickly realized that this product does exactly what it promises. My lashes did not clump, and I gained so much volume. After my lashes dried, they were soft to the touch and felt like I had never put any mascara on.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free through influenster for reviewing purposes. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Covergirl mascara. For the past few years I&#x27;ve used their waterproof lash blast mascara exclusively. I love that the lash bloom mascara keeps my lashes soft and separated. There&#x27;s no clumping and my lashes don&#x27;t get hard to the touch like they do with the lash blast. I would definitely use it as more of a day mascara because it is not as dramatic as others, very subtle. The only thing I dislike about this mascara is that it&#x27;s not waterproof. By the end of the day a lot of it has rubbed off. If this mascara was made waterproof it would be my new everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> Received this product compliments of Influenster and their awesome program! I tried out this mascara for a week and was just not feeling it. Perhaps I got a bad tube, but I feel like it&#x27;s a very dry formula that doesn&#x27;t really adhere well to my lashes - therefore leaving me with not much volume at all. The bristles on the brush are also very short, so I feel like they aren&#x27;t able to get into my lashes to provide volume, even if the formula could. I thank CoverGirl and Influenster for the opportunity to try it out, but this is not something I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I Liked and enjoyed using this mascara I have used it for about 2 1/2 weeks now. The brush feels like plastic but  it really gets the products in the root of my lash. It does not give me any fall out which I appreciate so much. I have a full review on my YouTube channel just look under Melanie Mejia Influenster review. I was sent this mascara for review by Influenster.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara through Influenster. I absolutely love this mascara. I used it for 7 days in a row and have continued to use to even longer. It is my daily mascara now. My eyelashes have definitely improved. This mascara isn&#x27;t rough on them at all. I don&#x27;t have any clumping issues and it doesn&#x27;t just flake off like a lot of other mascaras. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new mascara. The best part is it&#x27;s not overly expensive. Once this one runs out, I&#x27;m definitely willing to buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have received this product complimentary for testing purposes from influenster and I have to say that this product is perfect! I really love the way it make my lashes look and it actually super affordable. This product even make my lashes pop while I am wearing glasses and I know that is very rare for some mascara!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have been using it for about a week and a half now and I&#x27;m in love. It doesn&#x27;t clump and it gives my eyelashes the volume and length that I want without all of the extra mascara that usually makes my eyes irritated. This is a great drug store mascara and is worth the money. One of the best that i have used in a while. I&#x27;m going to have to buy some more because the complementary bottle I got from influenster is almost gone because I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I received this as a complimentary Influenster product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, now I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about the mascara is how light it goes on. Not necessarily meaning you have to put on a lot of coats, just that it&#x27;s not thick and clumpy looking or feeling. And it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy over time like so many other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous that it wasn&#x27;t waterproof, because that&#x27;s my preferred type of mascara due to oily skin and a bad habit of wiping at my eyes. But unless I purposely try and take the mascara off, it stays on just fine. It&#x27;s actually nice to have mascara that I don&#x27;t want to scrub and scrub to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be choosing this over my previous mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> I received  CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara for free from Influenster. It&#x27;s easy to apply and leaves your lashes feeling soft. It&#x27;s not as black and thick as I&#x27;d hope for. I usually use Two-Faced Better Than Sex Mascara, which goes on thick and creates a lot of drama. This mascara is definitely drugstore-quality, and I do like using it on my bottom lashes for a subtle look, but it&#x27;s just not dramatic enough for my upper lashes.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty mascara in both packaging and the wear.  It&#x27;s not super dramatic which makes it a perfect daily mascara and appropriate for work.  I like how the formula is buildable so I can put on another layer or two after work if I&#x27;m going out.  I was sent this mascara by Influenster for free to use for a week, but I&#x27;m still using it long beyond that.  The wand itself is a bit stiff (I expected it to be softer) but I had no problem using the wand for even my lower lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that, like a mediocre-quality foundation, the mascara will wear after some time, but because it is buildable, this hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.  I haven&#x27;t had it run or flake and also had no problem taking the mascara off with makeup remover.  Definitely will use until I&#x27;ve finished the tube!</li>
            <li> I actually love this mascara. Spreads out your eyelashes, doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and makes them longer. All in all, I&#x27;d purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Terribly stiff wand bristles. Doesn&#x27;t coat lashes at all.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara free from Influenster.com to try out and I really really like using this mascara! It is a bit dry so it clumps somewhat, but it really gives my barely there lashes a nice black look with a good amount of volume. Id definitely say its more of an everyday mascara for me, but its like my go to mascara when im in a hurry and just want my lashes to look like real lashes haha. The brush is different, I like how the bristles are spread apart. The color does live up to its name being &#x27;very black&#x27;. All in all I really like this mascara, I definitely would recommend it if you are someone like me that has sparse eyelashes and just want to make them look a little better without getting to dramatic (or if you already have great eyelashes im sure this would just make them even better), but this is a mousse formula so if you arent a fan of those id advice you not to get this one. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I received a full size CoverGirl full Lash Bloom Mascara for free from Influenster to try and review! I have extremely long eye lashes so I have to be careful with what mascaras I use. I am absolutely in love with this Bloom Mascara! It doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes like other brands that I have used! It goes on smooth and just one coat makes my lashes look great and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> *I received this mascara free to review from Inluenster, all opinons are my own* This is a very natural looking mascara don&#x27;t expect a falsies type of look because this is not that type of mascara.  It is great for everyday though as it doesn&#x27;t clump up and gives my lashes a fuller apperance.  One of the best things about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t flake on me nor does it smudge, I can even wear it on my bottom lash line and not have to worry about it smearing all over.  Plus it comes off every easily! I&#x27;ve been testing this mascara for a bout a month now, the one downside is that the longer I use it the more dry the formula becomes.  It&#x27;s not a very wet mascara to start off with, so for me it just makes applying it a bit harder. But if you prefer drier formulas then it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump together at all!</li>
            <li> I obtained a free CoverGirl mascara through influenster. I LOVE IT! My sister also loved it. I get good volume without the flakes. #goBloom</li>
            <li> I also got this from Influenster, and it&#x27;s easily my favorite product so far. I&#x27;m picky with mascara and have used a handful of different brands and types, and this is #1 on my list and the only mascara I use now. I use multiple coats for color and length, and it does really well without getting clumpy or gross. It lengthens my lashes really well and doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have spider legs on my eyes. I would definitely not pay $15 for it though. Maybe $7 or $8.</li>
            <li> I received a full size product for free courtesy of influenster so I was excited to use it. I wanted to like this mascara, but non waterproof formulas just don&#x27;t work on me. Perhaps if it was waterproof then I would have loved it. Normally I can layer nonwaterproof formulas over a waterproof one with success, but this one would uncurl my lashes even over a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I received cover girl full lash bloom mascara through my vox box from Influenster. After trying out the product for 7 days straight, I noticed that my lashes did strengthen on their own and fill out. The mascara was a little difficult to remove, and sorta pulled on my lashes, but it was really easy to put on and gave me a full thick lash. I recommend this product and I plan to purchase more once my current bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually very hesitant to try new mascaras just because once I find one that works for me, I&#x27;d like to stick with it. However, when I received this mascara compliments of Influenster I decided to give it a go and I definitely don&#x27;t regret it. Like many people have said, it gives length and volume without the cumpiness that most mascaras that advertise \\&quot;volume\\&quot; give. I personally like to look like I have more than three eye lashes, and this helps me do that. It goes on easy and lasts all day. Definitely a good everyday mascara!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Cover Girl GoBloom mascara when I received it complimentary Influenster. I really enjoyed the way this product looked once applied. It was extremely natural, and didn&#x27;t clump at all. I used this product for seven days in a row and found no irritation (I am a contact lens wearer). I recommend this product as a good everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> I received a full-size tube of COVERGIRL Full Lash Bloom Mascara complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the mascara was easy to apply. It did not make my lashes feel weighed down and heavy like other products that I have used. My lashes felt soft to the touch abd didn&#x27;t clump together.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster and I really enjoyed it. It is not flaky or dry and really spreads out the lashes. Yet another fantastic product from Covergirl, my forever &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; line. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. I have very short blonde eyelashes, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a mascara that will add definition to my lashes without clumping (I hate clumping). This mascara delivers. It&#x27;s lengthens and volumizes my lashes without getting clumpy. Wearing it I almost feel like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes. Great stuff. The only downside is that it&#x27;s kind of difficult to remove, even with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> I love the brush on this. My lashes look beautiful. It looks perfect for an everyday mascara. The issue is, it smears all over my face. I&#x27;ve tried this mascara several times and always get the same results. My makeup will look perfect and beautiful, then I&#x27;ll apply this and a few hours later it&#x27;s on my upper and lower eyelid. By the end of the day, I might as well have not applied mascara. I am very disappointed because it smears so much that it is unusable. I really want to love this because it creates such a beautiful look, but I cannot justify the smearing it causes. I will not repurchase or finish this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras from very expensive to fairly inexpensive and this one, I could say is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.  I have sensitive skin and no irritation. Comes off easily but does not smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> works well, no clumps.  looks natural.</li>
            <li> The product was ok. Seemed to be a bit old because it&#x27;s a bit dry when applying.</li>
            <li> Horrible. i got it because the reviews said it would keep my lashes soft which I love. I&#x27;m not one of those who likes cakey dried lashes. It&#x27;s true, my lashes were soft. BUT I tried it for two days and both days my eyes burned. I would&#x27;ve tried to get past the fact that it was gloppy thinking in time it would be less like that but I guess my eyes are just too sensitive for it. Started using Benefit instead. I gave this to my 18 year old, she used it once and threw it out.</li>
            <li> Okay so I received this complimentary from Influenster to try it out &amp; let them know what I think. I&#x27;m a huge lash person so this was a great one for me. I will give this 5 stars because it really does everything it promises. Your lashes will feel super soft and natural like there&#x27;s nothing even on it! And it separates the lashes extremely well so it shows lashes you never even knew you had. Great mascara for a subtle natural look!</li>
            <li> I received the product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. If you are looking for natural looking mascara, this is a mascara for you. It doesn&#x27;t show up real dark like other mascaras I have used. I also didn&#x27;t feel like the mascara gave me a lot of extra length. I have pretty long eye lashes, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned about the length. Overall, it is a great mascara that won&#x27;t flake off and leave you eyes looking black.</li>
            <li> I recently received COVERGIRL&#x27;s Full LashBloom by LashBlast Mascara complimentary for testing purposes through Influenster. I like this particular product mainly because of the petal-shaped brush. It allows for an even coat and flawless separation of the eyelashes. It is the ideal brush for mascara application. That being said, the coverage isn&#x27;t awesome. I would have had to use about 3 coats to get the kind of coverage that would be noticeable. I tried one coat and, in a couple of hours, it didn&#x27;t even look like I was wearing mascara. Overall, I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary as part of Influenster. I thought the formula was very smooth and it really did lengthen my lashes with just once coat. But it doesn&#x27;t last very long. After several hours, it started falling off and my eyelashes went back to looking bare.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from influenster and WOW! I love it! Before trying it I had read some reviews and saw mixed opinions. But it surpassed any previous expectations I had! It is one of the best drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used. In fact, I&#x27;d argue its better than many of the more expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. It provides length, volume, and curl to my straight lashes! I used it for 7 days and learned how to apply it to get its max potential. It&#x27;s so great! I think I&#x27;ve found a new go-to!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use mascara but I tried this out and loved it. I have told everyone I know about this. Best mascara out there right now.</li>
            <li> I was sent given a full sized sample of ‪COVERGIRLFull Lash Bloom‬ by ‪‎Lash Blast Mascara‬ from ‪‎Influenster‬ to test out and review! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I really like it! It&#x27;s a great day mascara; something to use when you want length but don&#x27;t want CRAZY dark or long lashes like you&#x27;d maybe want for a night out. The formula is great. It gives your lashes length without turning them into crunchy and clumpy &amp;#34;spider lashes&amp;#34;. The wand works well to separate your lashes and coat them evenly. I also like that the packaging allows for you to grip the wand without any trouble. I hate those bulky applicators. Even better, it stays on all day but comes off with ease when I take it off with my face wipes. I like this product a lot! I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and now that I know how the product is, I&#x27;m going to buy it in the future as well! Thank you Influenster and ‪Covergirl‬ ‪#‎gobloom‬</li>
            <li> I really am just not giving this mascara a full 5 star review because it is not waterproof and unfortunately their brand still tests on animals which is something that I don&#x27;t give my support to, but I received a complimentary sample from Influenster to try, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;I did the 7 day challenge and to be honest I was impressed! I am not sure if because of the fact that I don&#x27;t normally wear make up several times a day or because the product really improves your look (probably a little bit of both!). My lashes appeared way longer than normal and well defined. For the very FIRST time I got NO FLAKING, which is what would make me buy this mascara again in the future, since all the other mascaras that I tried end up clumping after they dry. It gives you a smooth and natural look, so I definitely recommend this product and really hope that someday soon they will stop testing on animals so I can return here and change my review to 5 stars. :)</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!! It goes on great, separates each lash and gives it crazy volume! I got this in a covergirl voxbox, and I am so glad they showed it to me. I can not live with out it!</li>
            <li> I have to say I loved testing this mascara complimentary of influenster! This mascara is perfect if you want a light and natural look, rather than a daring and bold look. I love that it did not clump and look like I was applying coat after coat. I saw no clumping, no flakes left on my skin after application. Which I had been having tons of problems with. If you&#x27;d like a more dramatic coat, just apply more coats rather than a single layer.</li>
            <li> I personally did not like this mascara at all. It feels so cheap I didnt want to put it near my eye balls. It did create a long wispy? lashes. I felt like it didnt have good color to it. It was really blah for me. I also did receive this product complimentary from Influenster. I think I naturally have long lashes that this didnt do what i expected it to do.</li>
            <li> I have been using the CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara for awhile now to test and review for free from Influenster. I actually really enjoyed using this product. I am usually pretty picky about mascara because I have long lashes and its hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t clump and looks good. This is a great product to have, it doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on really evenly. It lasts a long time but comes off with ease. I use it for everyday use so it is really reliable. Also I really like the packaging as well, not overly bulky and a good shape to handle. I will definitely continue to use this product for a long time. COVERGIRL #goBloom</li>
            <li> I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster and I must say that the mascara truly does what it advertises. It gives your lashes a natural lift exposing and beautifying your eye. It is not flaky or dry and gives you full yet long lashes. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Influenster sent me this to try out for review and I was so excited! I&#x27;m a huge fan over Covergirl mascaras and this was no disappointment. This is probably one of the best everyday mascaras. It creates length without clumps and doesn&#x27;t look caked on. It is a dryer formula, which I personally love. The brush applicator is huge but it still is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t get a ton of product on the brush than needed.&lt;br /&gt;All in all i think it is completely worth purchasing!</li>
