            <li>I love the KPak reconstructor.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be more cream-based.</li>
            <li>I do not believe this is an authentic Joico product.</li>
            <li>This stuff didn&#x27;t make my processed hair feel any better.</li>

            <li>Let cool for 5 and then style as desired.</li>
            <li>the trick is to leave it on your hair longer than 5 mins for full effect.</li>
            <li>so I knew this wasn&#x27;t the true product.</li>
            <li>My graying hair is healthier looking-it now has a shine-I am using it with my Joico Volumizing Shampoo-have also used it with other shampoos and get great results</li>
            <li>Every time I use this, my hair feels super sleek and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It helped my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li>I used this product once and it has left my hair very healthy and shinny again.</li>
            <li>First of all, I originally purchased this product in the 8.5 oz size</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic but what I received from this seller was not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair feeling healthy and soft, never oily.  </li>
            <li>The packaging looks right.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy it because it was the right price.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t seem right to me.</li>
            <li>My hair type is a very fine  and it looked healthy and restored it from a crispy state (for the most part- with damage like that, truly healthy hair is unrealistic!)</li>
            <li>I gave this 5 stars because it makes my hair super soft, silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great, thick product - recommended by my stylist at an Aveda Salon.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>A salon duped me into buying this expensive product saying it was the best conditioner for hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>I really noticed the difference!  </li>
            <li>I use it every time I wash my hair as I just had an intense color correction.</li>
            <li>too liquid so it will end fast.</li>
            <li>Save your money, buy the intense hydrator kapok instead.</li>
            <li>Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Its thick which is good</li>
            <li>I did see a post on Amazon about 2 weeks after I received my product that they were halting sales of the product from this particular vendor because of problems with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful conditioner, but it does go bad over time.</li>
            <li>For me personally,  I think the scent is definitely too strong.  </li>
            <li>Live all joico product</li>
            <li>It is totally ineffective and I can&#x27;t get a comb through my hair after I use it as would be expected with most conditioners.  </li>
            <li>so I went to a local salon and purchased another tube just to verify what i remembered about the first tube I had.</li>
            <li>and im not sure but also seeing many flyaways which could be split ends</li>
            <li>You will not get your moneys worth, because all the runny watered down product might not be the whole reconstructor as it should be.</li>
            <li>Clearly you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I like this for a deeper conditioner occasionally - use it once a week or so... really helps my hair</li>
            <li>My hairdresser said to only use it 2-3 times per month or it could be too much protein that could break my hair off.  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser recommended it for my dry, damaged, frizzy hair when we first met.</li>
            <li>I have dry, course, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>After doing some serious searching for the Amazon customer service number this problem was easily corrected with a credit for the difference.</li>

            <li> After doing some serious searching for the Amazon customer service number this problem was easily corrected with a credit for the difference.</li>
            <li> And I was right, the salon tube product was a thick creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> I now use a small amount of this reconstructor mixed with my normal conditioner which is also Joico on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before from my hairdresser and this is a pretty thick product</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten so dry over the years and K-Pak has brought it back to life!</li>
            <li> I have purchased so many expensive products which left my hair feeling greasy and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work because it is thin and did not feel like it was a deep reconstructor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never had dry, damaged, frizzy hair again.</li>
            <li> and it has saved my dry hair.</li>
            <li> so this was a total let down.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and was recommended to me by a friend.</li>
            <li> I recomend for very dry hair or damaged by chemical process.</li>
            <li> I did not really like the consistency of this product.  </li>
            <li> I just know that I will spend the extra few dollars and get it from my hairdresser from now on.</li>
            <li> I got a cut and highlights not too long ago and realized that my hair was slightly damaged from color</li>
            <li> I live in China and, unfortunately ended up bringing it here prior to trying it out</li>
            <li> but it might work for other people</li>
            <li> Product seems separated and watered down.  </li>
            <li> This product, however is watered down and not what you buy in the salon.</li>
            <li> I wish it would come down in price though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clumpy, emulsified, watered down junk that does not work.  </li>
            <li> It looks and feels watered down</li>
            <li> As previous reviewers have stated, it is runny and doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It NEVER leaves my hair feeling weighed down or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and this is totally a fake or else a very old, emulsified product.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I would not recommend anyone to waste their money on this.</li>
            <li> However, the product I received SMELLED ODD AND HAD A WEIRD TEXTURE; obviously, this product is a fraud.</li>
            <li> (too much protein is bad)</li>
            <li> If your hair is severely damaged this will not magically fix it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  not sure what was done to the product I got from Amazon</li>
            <li> After using this, it was hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> and I remember the consistency of the product as being a thick cream.</li>
            <li> I mean this product &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; works!</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this</li>
            <li> This product is a fake.  </li>
            <li> But the color is wrong, the consistency is wrong, and the product smells!  </li>
            <li> It consistency is awkward, liquid and</li>
            <li> And this product stinks....</li>
            <li> or maybe I just got a bad one:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> frustrated and disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible, terrible, worthless product.  </li>
            <li> Also this product smells terrible.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great, thick product - recommended by my stylist at an Aveda Salon. I use it every time I wash my hair as I just had an intense color correction. It&#x27;s keeping my hair from getting over-dry in the winter climate as it recovers!</li>
            <li> The packaging looks right.  But the color is wrong, the consistency is wrong, and the product smells!  I have used this product for years, and this is totally a fake or else a very old, emulsified product.  Never again.</li>
            <li> Product seems separated and watered down.  It literally goes through my fingers when I put it in my hand.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product looked expired! It consistency is awkward, liquid and the smell is way different from Joico&#x27;s. Moreover, it was unsealed so maybe it had oxidized leaving it like that.&lt;br /&gt;Very frustrated and disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is authentic and makes my hair silky and strong!</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time. My hair was very dry and was recommended to me by a friend. I shampoo my hair then apply and sit under the dryer for 10 min. Let cool for 5 and then style as desired. My hair feels so soft and smooth. A great product for a good value.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer! I love, love, LOVE this stuff! My hair has gotten so dry over the years and K-Pak has brought it back to life!</li>
            <li> Trashed my hair going from a red to platinum.  After using this, it was hard to tell.  My hair type is a very fine  and it looked healthy and restored it from a crispy state (for the most part- with damage like that, truly healthy hair is unrealistic!)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  If you find your hair brittle after chemically processes, you need to put this on go to bed and it in the morning your are good as new.  I have used this product for 20 years.</li>
            <li> too liquid so it will end fast. banana smell. after a year using it i didnt see any difference, senscience is much better than this.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times before and LOVED it. I decided to buy it because it was the right price. However, the product I received SMELLED ODD AND HAD A WEIRD TEXTURE; obviously, this product is a fraud. I would not recommend anyone buying this product on here. Save your money and buy it from a more reliable source.</li>
            <li> I love the KPak reconstructor.This product, however is watered down and not what you buy in the salon. I&#x27;m terribly disappointed. Clearly you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It was suggested by a hair dresser that I purchase this product to hydrate my hair.  I am very pleased that I chose Joico K-Pak.  K-Pak can only be used every 60 days.  I used it once and loved the results.  It has lessened the dryness I was experiencing.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it again for the second treatment.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a liquid form. It is supposed to be more cream-based. I do not believe this is an authentic Joico product. Never again.</li>
            <li> It works.  I mean this product &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; works!</li>
            <li> This product is a fake.  Do not order it.  I have purchased this product from Ulta before and it is fantastic but what I received from this seller was not the real deal.  I should have known as the price is way too low compared to legitimate stores.  I live in China and, unfortunately ended up bringing it here prior to trying it out so I cannot send it back.  As previous reviewers have stated, it is runny and doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair.  It is totally ineffective and I can&#x27;t get a comb through my hair after I use it as would be expected with most conditioners.  Please don&#x27;t support this seller by buying any of their garbage.</li>
            <li> this did not work for me at all but it might work for other people</li>
            <li> Save your money, buy the intense hydrator kapok instead. This stuff didn&#x27;t make my processed hair feel any better. It also looks like cottage cheese and smells like cheap tropical scented lip gloss. I LOVE Joico products so this was a total let down.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It helped me before and it will help me again to restore my hair to its life and make it look and feel even better!</li>
            <li> I like this for a deeper conditioner occasionally - use it once a week or so... really helps my hair</li>
            <li> For me personally,  I think the scent is definitely too strong.  I won&#x27;t be buying this brand any longer.  I&#x27;ve switched to It&#x27;s a 10 miracle hair mask and really love it!</li>
            <li> It is the only hair reconstructor I would bet my life on! I wish it would come down in price though.</li>
            <li> A salon duped me into buying this expensive product saying it was the best conditioner for hair like mine.  I have dry, course, very curly hair.  Redken&#x27;s Butter treat has been discontinued so the salon recommended this.  This is a horrible, terrible, worthless product.  It&#x27;s clumpy, emulsified, watered down junk that does not work.  Might as well use no conditioner!  And this product stinks....like rotten bananas.  Save your $30!  I was robbed!!</li>
            <li> Every time I use this, my hair feels super sleek and shiny.  My hairdresser said to only use it 2-3 times per month or it could be too much protein that could break my hair off.  I have been keeping with that for several months now and my hair is looking more fabulous than ever!</li>
            <li> My graying hair is healthier looking-it now has a shine-I am using it with my Joico Volumizing Shampoo-have also used it with other shampoos and get great results</li>
            <li> This does what no conditioner has done before. I use it regularly... the trick is to leave it on your hair longer than 5 mins for full effect.</li>
            <li> I did not really like the consistency of this product.  It looks and feels watered down or maybe I just got a bad one:(</li>
            <li> I used this product once and it has left my hair very healthy and shinny again. I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used K-Pak Deep - Penetrating Reconstructor for almost 20 years now. It is excellent!! My hair dresser recommended it for my dry, damaged, frizzy hair when we first met. Thank heavens for his recommendation &amp; for this product!!! I&#x27;m never had dry, damaged, frizzy hair again. It helped my hair tremendously. It is shiny &amp; silky now. Since it restored my hair several years ago, I only use it once a week now. Love this!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I gave this 5 stars because it makes my hair super soft, silky and smooth.  It NEVER leaves my hair feeling weighed down or heavy.  I have purchased so many expensive products which left my hair feeling greasy and weighed down.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work because it is thin and did not feel like it was a deep reconstructor.  However after blow drying my hair I really noticed the difference!  I now use a small amount of this reconstructor mixed with my normal conditioner which is also Joico on a daily basis.  It keeps my hair feeling healthy and soft, never oily.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants great hair!</li>
            <li> First of all, I originally purchased this product in the 8.5 oz size but when I received it they had sent me the 5.1 oz  size. After doing some serious searching for the Amazon customer service number this problem was easily corrected with a credit for the difference. Now to the product itself... When I went to use this product it was was almost entirely water with an occasional clump of conditioner that would come out of the bottle. I have purchased this product before from my hairdresser and this is a pretty thick product so I knew this wasn&#x27;t the true product. I have also purchased from a different vendor on Amazon with no problems. I did see a post on Amazon about 2 weeks after I received my product that they were halting sales of the product from this particular vendor because of problems with the quality of the product. I just know that I will spend the extra few dollars and get it from my hairdresser from now on.</li>
            <li> Always pleased with this product, I keep buying more.</li>
            <li> Live all joico product</li>
            <li> The K-PAK came in perfect condition, it is exactly what I wanted &amp; works great! I use it every week.Thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after I damaged my hair bleaching it.  Used with Joico K-pak shampoo and conditioner.  It helped but it&#x27;s not a miracle product.  If your hair is severely damaged this will not magically fix it.  My hair was brittle and this treatment did help enough to not have to cut all my hair off.  I waited until some grew out and then I would trim the ends until all the damaged hair was finally gone.  Also this product smells terrible.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem right to me. I had a 5.1 tube of this that I got at a local salon and I remember the consistency of the product as being a thick cream. When I got this tube I used it the next day while I was showering and I immediately noticed a difference. This product was runny kinda seemed as if it was watered down,really diluted or what seemed like bananas where mashed in a blender and put in this tube.  I was not happy with this so I went to a local salon and purchased another tube just to verify what i remembered about the first tube I had. And I was right, the salon tube product was a thick creamy consistency. I&#x27;m  not sure what was done to the product I got from Amazon but I would not recommend anyone to waste their money on this. You will not get your moneys worth, because all the runny watered down product might not be the whole reconstructor as it should be. The reason I ordered the 8.5 tube was so it can last me longer but turns out that it finishes way faster than the creamy product because of how watery it is. This is a terrible product!!</li>
            <li> This reconstructor is excellent! Much better than I expected. I recomend for very dry hair or damaged by chemical process.</li>
            <li> Beware of Joico K-Pak Reconstructor in anything over 5 oz bottles. This is a wonderful conditioner, but it does go bad over time. The last time I ordered it from Amazon, I got a larger size--the 8.5 oz size. The conditioner was usable but had already started to degrade.</li>
            <li> I got a cut and highlights not too long ago and realized that my hair was slightly damaged from color and im not sure but also seeing many flyaways which could be split ends well anyway i decided to do a protein treatment and this was perfect for it! Its thick which is good and i swear it smells like banana cream pie haha i will continue to purchase but only applying once a month (too much protein is bad) and then i follow up with a hair mask for deep conditioning NOTE your hair WILL  be  very dry immediately after rinsing  this product but nothing a good conditioner cant fix!</li>
            <li> I use this twice a week and it has saved my dry hair. I have tried a lot of deep conditioners and none had as lasting results as this. While this is a protein builder, and not a deep conditioner (you have use a conditioner after this), I&#x27;ve noticed it actually rebuilding the strength, shine and softness of my hair.</li>
