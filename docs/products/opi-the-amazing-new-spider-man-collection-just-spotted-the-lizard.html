            <li>adore it and keep it on the shelve with my FAVORITE shades :)</li>
            <li>I wear two coats, I am not quite sure that with just one it will be ok.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>was her favorite color.  </li>
            <li>So glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>It looks elegant with gold jewelry.  </li>
            <li>and I got many compliments :)</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>and I got many compliments.</li>
            <li>Lovely color, love Opi polishes.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on the color-changing properties.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really love it though.</li>
            <li>I love OPI - their polishes are always long-lasting.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this polish to be a bit darker gold/green, with much more of a teal facet to it, as is visible along the edges of the bottle in the picture.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the color to be more like it is on the bottle</li>
            <li>The gold/green duochrome is very strong and easy to see.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unique</li>
            <li>Just Spotted the Lizard is a pretty good Chanel Peridot dupe.</li>
            <li>The color is rich and goes with everything!</li>
            <li>Others have destroyed my nails, but OPI keeps them strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li>OPI is the best nail lacquer in my book, and this duochrome color lasts for not just days, but weeks, if applied carefully.</li>
            <li>I love the color and how the hues come out in the light.  </li>
            <li>Great service and great value on a polish that is hard to find.</li>
            <li>The polish was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and dries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>, it looks like a pretty color in the bottle with a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Spider-man fan, so I&#x27;m biased, but I get compliments on this color all the time.</li>
            <li>I love this polish so so much, is golden but then is greener, and is really cute and rare.</li>
            <li>:) What a fun shade.</li>
            <li>and the application is smooth.</li>
            <li>The color is a metallic gold/green (slightly more golden then shown in the product picture).</li>
            <li>I know, a lot of colors, but it changes depending on the light and angle.</li>
            <li>My new favorite nail color!</li>
            <li>This nail polish is a beautiful green/gold with pink tints.  </li>
            <li>This one was ok, not my favorite of colors but very different, you will not see this shade on anyone else&#x27;s nails for sure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still a cool color, and the staying power tells me it&#x27;s genuine</li>
            <li>The color is nice, elegant and different.</li>
            <li>In the sunlight or other bright light, it has quite a shimmer to it!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>i thought this polish would be really cool</li>
            <li>It applies on smoothly with the right amount of shimmer.</li>
            <li>I just love love love the way it seems to change color from green to gold.</li>
            <li>My new favorite.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was excited to see how it would look.</li>
            <li>I love OPI, longest lasting colors and huge color variety.  </li>
            <li>This is a great green golden color.</li>
            <li>smile.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn nothing but OPI polish for 10+ years, but never has a colour made me smile so</li>
            <li>This one by far is my favorite color out of this collection.</li>
            <li>OPI brand speaks for itself and was worth every dime.</li>
            <li>To me, it was a lot more gold, not very much green.</li>
            <li>I really love the color, but be aware that if you do not have perfectly smooth (buffed) nails, or use a ridge filler, this will look messy on your nail!&lt;br /&gt;Looks more golden on the nail than it does inside the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I saw this originally in the REAL SIMPLE magazine &amp; it looked a lot more &#x27;</li>
            <li>This is another great color from OPI  its gold and green depending on the light one color may stand out more than the other ,goes on easy only used two coats and a top coat ,this can be worn any season with just about anything.</li>
            <li>you have never used OPI before, I highly recommend it, because like I said, the polish is long-lasting, well-pigmented, goes on smoothly, and have well-designed brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This polish is incredibly smooth and only takes two coats tops for a brilliant gold/ green.</li>
            <li>It did not stay on very well and took more than one coat to cover nails completely.  </li>
            <li>The new green color is very pretty and we are happy</li>
            <li>Depending on the light, it can look completely gold, olive, or teal, or anything in between.</li>
            <li>item as described, thanks!</li>
            <li>It absolutely shimmers when sunlight hits it!  </li>
            <li>I first found this polish when I got my nails done for graduation</li>
            <li>i love opi nail polish, its the only brand that i buy.</li>
            <li>The duo-chrome at first I didn&#x27;t think was as visible as Chanel&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Totally one of my favorite polishes.</li>
            <li>all my friend always flatter me bacause of the polish, I love OPI polishes, totally recommended.</li>
            <li>Get lots of complements with this polish, love what it does at different angles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so pretty</li>
            <li>It is very reptilian, as the name suggests, and the green-to-yellow spectrum of colors is perfect for my school (our colors are green and yellow).</li>
            <li>i was sceptical about this color at first, I never saw it in person, but for those who also can&#x27;t it&#x27;s more gold than green, but it&#x27;s a fantastic color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an exact dupe for Chanel Peridot but MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also not sheer, 2 coats made for a very bold metallic green/gold</li>
            <li>shimmery gold with hints of olive at certain angles.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty color, but I was expecting it to be more green than it is.  </li>
            <li>Very hypnotic.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like this color.</li>
            <li>This OPI color is unusual and is a must for summer.  </li>
            <li>It wears very well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, item as specified.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoy this color, although I don&#x27;t think it is exceedingly versatile.</li>
            <li>In the bottle it looks gold with green shimmer, but on the nail it takes on a life of its own.</li>
            <li>I own a few lizards and was looking for lizard garden statues</li>
            <li>This was probably designed to be a duplicate of Chanel&#x27;s nail color called Peridot, because it is pretty much exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>its decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried, the polish itself is really high quality.  </li>
            <li>color is mostly a gold color that shifts to a greener gold and sometimes just green as you move around.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s green or gold, depending on the light!</li>
            <li>Both of us love the polish, which looks gold and a bit green at times.  </li>
            <li>My new go to cover, doesn&#x27;t show the chips and goes with everything</li>
            <li>I liked how the deep Green reflected other tones and was not boring like a basic color.</li>
            <li>It is gold when you look straight at it, green if the light is out in front of you, and blue at a very steep angle.</li>
            <li>the seller shipped quickly and it was carefully packaged.  </li>
            <li>Once you put the polish on, it doesn&#x27;t have the hints of blue at certain angles</li>
            <li>It looks green in one light and gold in another.  </li>
            <li>and it has lots of dynamic dimension, looking different at different angles or levels of light.</li>
            <li>Too much gold and not enough</li>
            <li>Oh wow, it&#x27;s like chameleon pigments in a bottle.</li>
            <li>no shimmer, no green, no teal.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite nail polish, it somehow looks like gold and green at the same time.</li>
            <li>Great for casual or dressy, especially if you are wearing gold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having several different colors on your nails at once -- it looks different in different types of light.  </li>
            <li>Like other colors with a shimmery quality, you&#x27;ll probably want to make sure you have a good quality base coat -- it tends to settle into any inperfection on the nail and draw attention to it otherwise.</li>
            <li>I applied two coats of it and got kind of a green tinted gold, not an lizard green with a gold shimmer like I thought from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its more gold-ish than green, I wish it was the other way around.</li>
            <li>Goes from bronze to blue to green as you move your hand/as the light hits it from different dimensions.</li>
            <li>Shifts between olive green &amp; gold, weird in a really cool way :)</li>
            <li>Less blue than pictured (you&#x27;d never know it had blue undertones when it&#x27;s on), but a lovely take on gold with a little uniqueness to it.</li>
            <li>It lasted 3 whole days with no major chips, and I am super tough on my nails.</li>
            <li>I thought it applied fantastically, and I got a compliment on it only SECONDS after the first person other than myself (or my boyfriend) saw it!!  </li>

            <li> You should probably buy this color if you don&#x27;t already own a duplicate of it.  </li>
            <li> and I was on a mission to own my own bottle.</li>
            <li> Nice iridescent hue.  </li>
            <li> one of OPIs new colors and this one looks great!</li>
            <li> I love OPI lacquer for all their great colors and fantastic quality.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOOVE this shade!</li>
            <li> Very cool for a nice change.</li>
            <li> Two coats are all that is needed and it goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> ok, my bud i ride the bus with on fridays</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the color and have gotten tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> Even without top coat, it lasted a week before any noticeable wear set in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all of those and something more.  </li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color.  </li>
            <li> I chose it one day at the nail salon on a whim and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this color for my toes in the summer.  </li>
            <li> Currently enjoying it on my toes.</li>
            <li> Got this color and love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Compliments most sandals worn with it.  </li>
            <li> adore it and keep it on the shelve with my FAVORITE shades :)</li>
            <li> I wear two coats, I am not quite sure that with just one it will be ok.</li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> was her favorite color.  </li>
            <li> So glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> It looks elegant with gold jewelry.  </li>
            <li> and I got many compliments :)</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> and I got many compliments.</li>
            <li> Lovely color, love Opi polishes.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on the color-changing properties.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really love it though.</li>
            <li> I love OPI - their polishes are always long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this polish to be a bit darker gold/green, with much more of a teal facet to it, as is visible along the edges of the bottle in the picture.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the color to be more like it is on the bottle</li>
            <li> The gold/green duochrome is very strong and easy to see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very unique</li>
            <li> Just Spotted the Lizard is a pretty good Chanel Peridot dupe.</li>
            <li> The color is rich and goes with everything!</li>
            <li> Others have destroyed my nails, but OPI keeps them strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li> OPI is the best nail lacquer in my book, and this duochrome color lasts for not just days, but weeks, if applied carefully.</li>
            <li> I love the color and how the hues come out in the light.  </li>
            <li> Great service and great value on a polish that is hard to find.</li>
            <li> The polish was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and dries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> , it looks like a pretty color in the bottle with a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Spider-man fan, so I&#x27;m biased, but I get compliments on this color all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this polish so so much, is golden but then is greener, and is really cute and rare.</li>
            <li> :) What a fun shade.</li>
            <li> and the application is smooth.</li>
            <li> The color is a metallic gold/green (slightly more golden then shown in the product picture).</li>
            <li> I know, a lot of colors, but it changes depending on the light and angle.</li>
            <li> My new favorite nail color!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is a beautiful green/gold with pink tints.  </li>
            <li> This one was ok, not my favorite of colors but very different, you will not see this shade on anyone else&#x27;s nails for sure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still a cool color, and the staying power tells me it&#x27;s genuine</li>
            <li> The color is nice, elegant and different.</li>
            <li> In the sunlight or other bright light, it has quite a shimmer to it!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> i thought this polish would be really cool</li>
            <li> It applies on smoothly with the right amount of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I just love love love the way it seems to change color from green to gold.</li>
            <li> My new favorite.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was excited to see how it would look.</li>
            <li> I love OPI, longest lasting colors and huge color variety.  </li>
            <li> This is a great green golden color.</li>
            <li> smile.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn nothing but OPI polish for 10+ years, but never has a colour made me smile so</li>
            <li> This one by far is my favorite color out of this collection.</li>
            <li> OPI brand speaks for itself and was worth every dime.</li>
            <li> To me, it was a lot more gold, not very much green.</li>
            <li> I really love the color, but be aware that if you do not have perfectly smooth (buffed) nails, or use a ridge filler, this will look messy on your nail!&lt;br /&gt;Looks more golden on the nail than it does inside the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I saw this originally in the REAL SIMPLE magazine &amp; it looked a lot more &#x27;</li>
            <li> This is another great color from OPI  its gold and green depending on the light one color may stand out more than the other ,goes on easy only used two coats and a top coat ,this can be worn any season with just about anything.</li>
            <li> you have never used OPI before, I highly recommend it, because like I said, the polish is long-lasting, well-pigmented, goes on smoothly, and have well-designed brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This polish is incredibly smooth and only takes two coats tops for a brilliant gold/ green.</li>
            <li> It did not stay on very well and took more than one coat to cover nails completely.  </li>
            <li> The new green color is very pretty and we are happy</li>
            <li> Depending on the light, it can look completely gold, olive, or teal, or anything in between.</li>
            <li> item as described, thanks!</li>
            <li> It absolutely shimmers when sunlight hits it!  </li>
            <li> I first found this polish when I got my nails done for graduation</li>
            <li> i love opi nail polish, its the only brand that i buy.</li>
            <li> The duo-chrome at first I didn&#x27;t think was as visible as Chanel&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Totally one of my favorite polishes.</li>
            <li> all my friend always flatter me bacause of the polish, I love OPI polishes, totally recommended.</li>
            <li> Get lots of complements with this polish, love what it does at different angles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so pretty</li>
            <li> It is very reptilian, as the name suggests, and the green-to-yellow spectrum of colors is perfect for my school (our colors are green and yellow).</li>
            <li> i was sceptical about this color at first, I never saw it in person, but for those who also can&#x27;t it&#x27;s more gold than green, but it&#x27;s a fantastic color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an exact dupe for Chanel Peridot but MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also not sheer, 2 coats made for a very bold metallic green/gold</li>
            <li> shimmery gold with hints of olive at certain angles.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color, but I was expecting it to be more green than it is.  </li>
            <li> Very hypnotic.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this color.</li>
            <li> This OPI color is unusual and is a must for summer.  </li>
            <li> It wears very well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, item as specified.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoy this color, although I don&#x27;t think it is exceedingly versatile.</li>
            <li> In the bottle it looks gold with green shimmer, but on the nail it takes on a life of its own.</li>
            <li> I own a few lizards and was looking for lizard garden statues</li>
            <li> This was probably designed to be a duplicate of Chanel&#x27;s nail color called Peridot, because it is pretty much exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> its decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried, the polish itself is really high quality.  </li>
            <li> color is mostly a gold color that shifts to a greener gold and sometimes just green as you move around.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s green or gold, depending on the light!</li>
            <li> Both of us love the polish, which looks gold and a bit green at times.  </li>
            <li> My new go to cover, doesn&#x27;t show the chips and goes with everything</li>
            <li> I liked how the deep Green reflected other tones and was not boring like a basic color.</li>
            <li> It is gold when you look straight at it, green if the light is out in front of you, and blue at a very steep angle.</li>
            <li> the seller shipped quickly and it was carefully packaged.  </li>
            <li> Once you put the polish on, it doesn&#x27;t have the hints of blue at certain angles</li>
            <li> It looks green in one light and gold in another.  </li>
            <li> and it has lots of dynamic dimension, looking different at different angles or levels of light.</li>
            <li> Too much gold and not enough</li>
            <li> Oh wow, it&#x27;s like chameleon pigments in a bottle.</li>
            <li> no shimmer, no green, no teal.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite nail polish, it somehow looks like gold and green at the same time.</li>
            <li> Great for casual or dressy, especially if you are wearing gold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having several different colors on your nails at once -- it looks different in different types of light.  </li>
            <li> Like other colors with a shimmery quality, you&#x27;ll probably want to make sure you have a good quality base coat -- it tends to settle into any inperfection on the nail and draw attention to it otherwise.</li>
            <li> I applied two coats of it and got kind of a green tinted gold, not an lizard green with a gold shimmer like I thought from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its more gold-ish than green, I wish it was the other way around.</li>
            <li> Goes from bronze to blue to green as you move your hand/as the light hits it from different dimensions.</li>
            <li> Shifts between olive green &amp; gold, weird in a really cool way :)</li>
            <li> Less blue than pictured (you&#x27;d never know it had blue undertones when it&#x27;s on), but a lovely take on gold with a little uniqueness to it.</li>
            <li> It lasted 3 whole days with no major chips, and I am super tough on my nails.</li>
            <li> I thought it applied fantastically, and I got a compliment on it only SECONDS after the first person other than myself (or my boyfriend) saw it!!  </li>
            <li> I applied three coats of this color on Sunday and sealed it with a Sally Hanson Quick-Drying topcoat (the red bottle) and it is now Friday, and there is only some very minor chipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to buy another bottle, mainly because the bottle I got is hard to open and close for some reason.</li>
            <li> second gripe is that the polish is translucent and needs at least 2-3 coats to look decent.</li>
            <li> I find myself admiring my nails all day long when I wear this.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, it looked beautiful online.</li>
            <li> It actually looks dark gold when it is on my nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorites along with A Woman&#x27;s Prague-ative and Not Really a Waitress.</li>
            <li> Looks gold or green in different lighting.</li>
            <li> but my friends were intrigued by the polish and asked me if it was yellow or green.</li>
            <li> other OPI shades</li>
            <li> I also bought the other Lizard one Spider-Man set &amp;#34;Shatter the Scales&amp;#34; a shatter lacquer.</li>
            <li> I looked at the other reviews, and everyone but me seems to be amazed by this color.</li>
            <li> A single coat looks uneven and shows all brush strokes.</li>
            <li> looks like a little pink?</li>
            <li> This product required around three coats for me, with average drying time.</li>
            <li> The polish is typical of what you expect from OPI.</li>
            <li> and i was green with envy....  </li>
            <li> I get a few comments or questions about it</li>
            <li> The color is like a lizardy olive green with a metallic finish.</li>
            <li> she commented green</li>
            <li> It does look green</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s green.....</li>
            <li> Shades of gold and green, with an almost iridescent quality.</li>
            <li> It looks gold when you apply it, when it dries it looks green or</li>
            <li> It seems thick but still manageable to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like seriously, you just got to have it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It goes to show that you can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI.</li>
            <li> so that was a disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> Weird color - just as it is intended to be!</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think OPI can make a bad color either.</li>
            <li> but its not sooo bad.</li>

            <li> ok, my bud i ride the bus with on fridays had this color on her toenails and i was green with envy....  smile.  She could not remember the name....  I FOUND IT...  And it is on it&#x27;s way.....  Yay!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps:  there is also something called shatter the scales spot the lizard.  color shown on the display looks very similar to  the spot the lizard.  mmmmm.  go figger.</li>
            <li> The polish was delivered very quickly. It seems thick but still manageable to apply. I absolutely love the color and have gotten tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely gorgeous! In the bottle it looks gold with green shimmer, but on the nail it takes on a life of its own. Depending on the light, it can look completely gold, olive, or teal, or anything in between. It goes on very smooth and dries relatively quickly. Even without top coat, it lasted a week before any noticeable wear set in.</li>
            <li> This polish is incredibly smooth and only takes two coats tops for a brilliant gold/ green. It literally looks like straight up gold one minute then green the next. awesome color.</li>
            <li> item as described, thanks!</li>
            <li> Shifts between olive green &amp; gold, weird in a really cool way :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, nice and shiny, wears well.  Makes a great addition to anyone&#x27;s polish collection!</li>
            <li> This is the most gorgeous color I&#x27;ve ever worn. I can&#x27;t stop staring at it. It took me three coats for full coverage, but my word is it beautiful. Very hypnotic.</li>
            <li> Less blue than pictured (you&#x27;d never know it had blue undertones when it&#x27;s on), but a lovely take on gold with a little uniqueness to it.</li>
            <li> This nail polish inspired by the movie Spiderman is awesome.  It looks green in one light and gold in another.  It&#x27;s like getting 2 colors in 1 bottle.</li>
            <li> You should probably buy this color if you don&#x27;t already own a duplicate of it.  The color is amazing.  This was probably designed to be a duplicate of Chanel&#x27;s nail color called Peridot, because it is pretty much exactly the same.  Search for a comparison (there are a lot of blogs out there that have this info) if you want to see just how close it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is mostly a gold color that shifts to a greener gold and sometimes just green as you move around.  I thought it applied fantastically, and I got a compliment on it only SECONDS after the first person other than myself (or my boyfriend) saw it!!  I&#x27;m also happy to say that my topcoat did not seem to have any affect on the color itself.  In the sunlight or other bright light, it has quite a shimmer to it!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Just Spotted the Lizard is a pretty good Chanel Peridot dupe. That&#x27;s why I chose this nail polish and it looks great on.  Just about every day I have it on I get a few comments or questions about it and it has lots of dynamic dimension, looking different at different angles or levels of light.</li>
            <li> The colour is amazing!  Is it gold?  Is it turquoise?  Is it jade?  It&#x27;s all of those and something more.  I&#x27;ve worn nothing but OPI polish for 10+ years, but never has a colour made me smile so; I can&#x27;t stop staring at my nails! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE &#x27;Just Spotted the Lizard\\&quot;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the seller shipped quickly and it was carefully packaged.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It did not stay on very well and took more than one coat to cover nails completely.  I still like it though</li>
            <li> This one by far is my favorite color out of this collection. It goes great with my skin tone medium brown. I love this color.</li>
            <li> Cant keep track of all the names, use them all.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color.  I chose it one day at the nail salon on a whim and fell in love with it.  It&#x27;s a beautiful green/blue/gold color that changes depending on the angle.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color! I&#x27;ve been using it since my wedding in 2012.. It&#x27;s green or gold, depending on the light! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I gave this nail polish a perfect score because even though I haven&#x27;t put it on yet, it looks like a pretty color in the bottle with a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> Amazing color. Goes from bronze to blue to green as you move your hand/as the light hits it from different dimensions. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is another great color from OPI  its gold and green depending on the light one color may stand out more than the other ,goes on easy only used two coats and a top coat ,this can be worn any season with just about anything.</li>
            <li> I love this color for my toes in the summer.  It absolutely shimmers when sunlight hits it!  It&#x27;s one of my favorites along with A Woman&#x27;s Prague-ative and Not Really a Waitress.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t kid yourself -- Just the Spotted Lizard is NOT a budget-friendly dupe for Chanel Peridot. Too much gold and not enough green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second gripe is that the polish is translucent and needs at least 2-3 coats to look decent. A single coat looks uneven and shows all brush strokes.</li>
            <li> I like this color. I bought it as a dupe for Chanel&#x27;s Peridot. Currently enjoying it on my toes. However, the boyfriend hates it. Too bad. I am still going to enjoy it!!!</li>
            <li> Got this color and love it. The color is like a lizardy olive green with a metallic finish. I&#x27;ve already worn it and I love it. Great color for fall.</li>
            <li> The packaging was swift and delt with care. I liked how the deep Green reflected other tones and was not boring like a basic color. OPI brand speaks for itself and was worth every dime. Definitely would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I love this color! I get compliments on it all the time &amp; you CANNOT beat the price! Extremely happy!</li>
            <li> I first found this polish when I got my nails done for graduation and I was on a mission to own my own bottle. I adore it.</li>
            <li> This polish goes on smooth and looks great. Nice iridescent hue.  It goes to show that you can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI.</li>
            <li> Bought one for me and one for a friend.  Both of us love the polish, which looks gold and a bit green at times.  Compliments most sandals worn with it.  Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Beautiful....stay tuned...</li>
            <li> Great service and great value on a polish that is hard to find. Weird color - just as it is intended to be!</li>
            <li> i love opi nail polish, its the only brand that i buy. this color does not dissappoint! it picks all of the colors in it wonderfully in the light, but i noticed that i mainly saw the gold gleam in it, which was great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible.  Looks gold or green in different lighting.</li>
            <li> My new go to cover, doesn&#x27;t show the chips and goes with everything</li>
            <li> i was sceptical about this color at first, I never saw it in person, but for those who also can&#x27;t it&#x27;s more gold than green, but it&#x27;s a fantastic color. I don&#x27;t think OPI can make a bad color either. it&#x27;s also not sheer, 2 coats made for a very bold metallic green/gold</li>
            <li> Beautiful polish! Great dupe to Chanel&#x27;s peridot nail polish. The duo-chrome at first I didn&#x27;t think was as visible as Chanel&#x27;s but my friends were intrigued by the polish and asked me if it was yellow or green.</li>
            <li> I really love the color, but be aware that if you do not have perfectly smooth (buffed) nails, or use a ridge filler, this will look messy on your nail!&lt;br /&gt;Looks more golden on the nail than it does inside the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I adore it and keep it on the shelve with my FAVORITE shades :)</li>
            <li> I love this polish so so much, is golden but then is greener, and is really cute and rare. I wear two coats, I am not quite sure that with just one it will be ok. Totally one of my favorite polishes. It looks so great with everything and everywhere, all my friend always flatter me bacause of the polish, I love OPI polishes, totally recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this color. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this color.</li>
            <li> Had this color on my toenails.  When my doctor saw the color she commented green was her favorite color.  So I finally found the color online and gave it to her.  She was very pleased!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color, but I was expecting it to be more green than it is.  It actually looks dark gold when it is on my nails.  Still very nice.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is a beautiful green/gold with pink tints.  The photo doesn&#x27;t do it justice.  It&#x27;s like having several different colors on your nails at once -- it looks different in different types of light.  It is very stylish without being too bold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other OPI shades I&#x27;ve tried, the polish itself is really high quality.  Two coats are all that is needed and it goes on very smoothly.  Like other colors with a shimmery quality, you&#x27;ll probably want to make sure you have a good quality base coat -- it tends to settle into any inperfection on the nail and draw attention to it otherwise.</li>
            <li> Once you put the polish on, it doesn&#x27;t have the hints of blue at certain angles like it does on the bottle. But it&#x27;s still a gorgeous color- shimmery gold with hints of olive at certain angles.</li>
            <li> I love this color! The polish is typical of what you expect from OPI. The quality is great, it applies evenly and wears well. The gold/green duochrome is very strong and easy to see. It&#x27;s an exact dupe for Chanel Peridot but MUCH cheaper. So glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I love OPI, longest lasting colors and huge color variety.  This one was ok, not my favorite of colors but very different, you will not see this shade on anyone else&#x27;s nails for sure.  Its more gold-ish than green, I wish it was the other way around.</li>
            <li> This OPI color is unusual and is a must for summer.  It does look green, then gold -- reminds me of the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; mood rings that would change color with a change in temperature.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing!  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.  It looks elegant with gold jewelry.  The color is rich and goes with everything!</li>
            <li> I am fascinated by this polish. It is gold when you look straight at it, green if the light is out in front of you, and blue at a very steep angle. Kinda sparkly no matter how you look at it. Not for wall flowers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Spider-man fan, so I&#x27;m biased, but I get compliments on this color all the time. OPI is the best nail lacquer in my book, and this duochrome color lasts for not just days, but weeks, if applied carefully.</li>
            <li> This product required around three coats for me, with average drying time. It didn&#x27;t chip at all for me-- my nail started growing under it and I kept it on for about two weeks. It&#x27;s a beautiful color and I got many compliments :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color! The first time I used it I was excited to see how it would look. This color is awesome, it&#x27;s gold.... no.... it&#x27;s green..... wait.... looks like a little pink? Oh wow, it&#x27;s like chameleon pigments in a bottle. :) What a fun shade.</li>
            <li> This is a great green golden color. It applies on smoothly with the right amount of shimmer. It truly is a beautiful color. Also, it is part of the Amazing Spiderman collection. It&#x27;s like seriously, you just got to have it.</li>
            <li> This is the best Nail polish so far!!!!! *-*&lt;br /&gt;You MUST own it! D:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and best seller too ;)&lt;br /&gt;you won&#x27;t regret it like i said before.</li>
            <li> Love the color. It&#x27;s very unique and I got many compliments. And OPI is great polish. It wears very well.</li>
            <li> Lovely color, love Opi polishes. Fast delivery, item as specified. Would reorder from again, would recommend to friend. Get lots of complements with this polish, love what it does at different angles.</li>
            <li> awesome changing color!  A friend told me about this polish and I don&#x27;t regret getting it at all.  I just love love love the way it seems to change color from green to gold.</li>
            <li> I saw this originally in the REAL SIMPLE magazine &amp; it looked a lot more &#x27;tiger eye&#x27; color. To me, it was a lot more gold, not very much green. I&#x27;m fair skinned so maybe that has something to do with it. But as for the quality of the product, any OPI polish is a good polish to buy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop staring at my nails! This is by far my favorite nail polish, it somehow looks like gold and green at the same time. Anyone who is considering buying it should go for the buy.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, elegant and different. It&#x27;s just so pretty and the application is smooth. I&#x27;m tempted to buy another bottle, mainly because the bottle I got is hard to open and close for some reason.</li>
            <li> i thought this polish would be really cool cuz 1) its theme is from the amazing spiderman and 2) its a duochrome. but the blue doesnt even show up on the nail. so that was a disappointment for me. but its not sooo bad. its decent.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy anything but OPI for my nails.  Others have destroyed my nails, but OPI keeps them strong and healthy.  This color is awesome.  I get many compliments on the color-changing properties.  I find myself admiring my nails all day long when I wear this.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need 3 coats but it stays on FOREVER! Love it.</li>
            <li> I love OPI lacquer for all their great colors and fantastic quality. This is no exception. The color is a metallic gold/green (slightly more golden then shown in the product picture). I really love it though. I also bought the other Lizard one Spider-Man set &amp;#34;Shatter the Scales&amp;#34; a shatter lacquer. And it looks absolutely perfect over this golden/green lacquer! Great compliment. I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I am fairly conservative when it comes to nail polish colors. But I tried this anyway and loved it. Shades of gold and green, with an almost iridescent quality. Great for casual or dressy, especially if you are wearing gold. Same OPI quality. Very cool for a nice change.</li>
            <li> I love this color, very happy</li>
            <li> My new favorite.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this polish on my toes for a month.  Still looks like the day I painted.  OPI is the best on the market and this color is awesome.</li>
            <li> one of OPIs new colors and this one looks great! The new green color is very pretty and we are happy</li>
            <li> I looked at the other reviews, and everyone but me seems to be amazed by this color. I got my nails done yesterday and they are just gold...no shimmer, no green, no teal. Very disappointed, it looked beautiful online.</li>
            <li> I actually came across this nail polish by mistake.  I own a few lizards and was looking for lizard garden statues but when this beautiful nail polish popped up, I couldn&#x27;t resist getting it.  I love the color and how the hues come out in the light.  This was meant to be!!</li>
            <li> I love OPI - their polishes are always long-lasting. I applied three coats of this color on Sunday and sealed it with a Sally Hanson Quick-Drying topcoat (the red bottle) and it is now Friday, and there is only some very minor chipping. I even received a compliment on my nails yesterday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used OPI before, I highly recommend it, because like I said, the polish is long-lasting, well-pigmented, goes on smoothly, and have well-designed brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product only 4 out of 5 stars because I find the picture a bit misleading. I was expecting this polish to be a bit darker gold/green, with much more of a teal facet to it, as is visible along the edges of the bottle in the picture. In reality, this color is a lighter green-copper-gold-yellow...I know, a lot of colors, but it changes depending on the light and angle. It is very reptilian, as the name suggests, and the green-to-yellow spectrum of colors is perfect for my school (our colors are green and yellow). Overall, I really enjoy this color, although I don&#x27;t think it is exceedingly versatile.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOOVE this shade!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the color to be more like it is on the bottle but this is a semi sheer color. I applied two coats of it and got kind of a green tinted gold, not an lizard green with a gold shimmer like I thought from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a cool color, and the staying power tells me it&#x27;s genuine OPI- It lasted 3 whole days with no major chips, and I am super tough on my nails.</li>
            <li> I do not like being REQUIRED to fill in this field.  If I have to continue to do this on all my purchases they will not get ratings!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish!  It looks gold when you apply it, when it dries it looks green or teal depending on the angle.  My new favorite nail color!</li>
