            <li> Much better than less expensive and lighter weight products available through local pharmacies and suppliers.  </li>
            <li> Versatility is much appreciated - this product can be used both hot &amp; cold.  </li>
            <li> Elasto-Gel is thicker, stays cold longer and is more flexible than the  cheaper gel packs.</li>
            <li> (since I needed 4 of them for wrapping both knees and having a set getting cold while the other set was applied.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The will likely be around our home for years to come, but with the recent surgeries, I have already gotten my money&#x27;s worth from them.</li>
            <li> and then doing it over every time you needed to ice down.  </li>
            <li> It is soft, flexible and holds the cold for 20 min.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in that the velcro does not adhere to the wrap itself like the older ones used in rehab offices.  </li>
            <li> Only stays cold about one hour</li>
            <li> and then you need a back up or have to wait for it to get cold again.</li>
            <li> The extra length around the arm also helps keep the wrap cold longer.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still plenty cold after 30 minutes to use.</li>
            <li> I also wrap it around my head when I get a bad headache</li>

            <li> Easy to use and stays on area well!</li>
            <li> Had knee surgery. This works great to do a 360&#x27; on the knee! Elasto Gel is excellent - it stays colder longer than the usual ice packs!  You won&#x27;t regret having an elasto gel for icing whatever you need to ice.</li>
            <li> Used these for both my Total Hip Replacement (15 weeks post-op) and my recent (6-week post-op) Bilateral Total Knee Replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product, no negatives though I wished they were a bit cheaper (since I needed 4 of them for wrapping both knees and having a set getting cold while the other set was applied.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The will likely be around our home for years to come, but with the recent surgeries, I have already gotten my money&#x27;s worth from them.</li>
            <li> My neighbor had knee replacement and recommended this item for my meniscus recuperation.  I was using the &amp;#34;bag of frozen peas&amp;#34; for icing my knee after therapy.  The ElastoGel works wonderfully and comfortably fits around the knee with velcro tabs.  I have only used it frozen for icing, not heating.  It is soft, flexible and holds the cold for 20 min.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product for the cost. My father recently had knee replacement, works great and stays cold</li>
            <li> Disappointed in that the velcro does not adhere to the wrap itself like the older ones used in rehab offices.  When using it on the shoulder that is very important.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful. I wrap my knee for instant relief. I also wrap it around my head when I get a bad headache and it works great at relieving my pain.</li>
            <li> JUST HD KNEE REPLACEMENT  THIS PRODUCT WAS A LIFE SAVER  GETS THE COLDEST IF YOU FOLD IT AS APOSED TO ROLLING</li>
            <li> Same product that was used during PT sessions - it&#x27;s professional grade and is well worth the $$ spent.  Much better than less expensive and lighter weight products available through local pharmacies and suppliers.  Versatility is much appreciated - this product can be used both hot &amp; cold.  Glad I bought this product for sure.</li>
            <li> Does everything it claims to do.  Problem is fitting it in the freezer with all the food but that is a problem of my own making.  Only stays cold about one hour and then you need a back up or have to wait for it to get cold again.</li>
            <li> The 9 X 24 wrap is great to use for almost any part of the body for after surgeries or just for swelling, sprain,&lt;br /&gt;etc.&lt;br /&gt;My husband had his knee replaced 4 weeks ago and without the wrap we would be filling plastic bags with&lt;br /&gt;ice and then doing it over every time you needed to ice down.  With the wrap you use for 20 to 25 minutes&lt;br /&gt;then put in freezer for the next use.  It&#x27;s always ready and with no mess.&lt;br /&gt;Great for my lower back pain also.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with these wraps when my physical therapist used them on me after knee replacement surgery. Absolutely the best thing ever!!!!! After just 10 minutes with this wrap on my knee felt so much better. I went home and ordered this with RUSH delivery. Had it on my knee by 2pm the next day! I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough. I&#x27;ve told my surgeon and anyone else who will listen about how much relief this product gives....</li>
            <li> I had a knee replacement and have back problems.  I bought two of these: one I keep in the freezer and one I use for&lt;br /&gt;heat.  They&#x27;re great after physical therapy and for nagging back pain.  High quality and very well-made.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> works great, stays nice &amp;cold for the 20 min. I&#x27;m using it!</li>
            <li> Very, very nice, it keeps cold for about an hour.</li>
            <li> Elasto-Gel was recommended by my physical therapist at the hospital. Elasto-Gel is thicker, stays cold longer and is more flexible than the  cheaper gel packs. Well worth the extra money. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I ordered this size for use on my elbow, it is also be large enough to use elsewhere if needed. The extra width (9&amp;#34; vs. 6&amp;#34; for the recommended elbow wrap) provides additional coverage above and below my elbow that I need. The extra length around the arm also helps keep the wrap cold longer. I&#x27;ve had this on for 30 minutes and it&#x27;s still plenty cold after 30 minutes to use. My physical therapist used and recommended this to me. I wish I would have got it sooner. I can move about the house instead of spending time balancing a standard ice pack on a pillow.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice gel pack very well made as well as easy to use on different areas of your body.</li>
            <li> fantastic product--awesome price--bought another one for a friend who needed one.</li>
            <li> A great produce that stays cold for a long time</li>
            <li> it is just like they use at therapy</li>
            <li> It is a nice wrap, but do not like the straps as I do not always need to use them and then they are in the way.</li>
